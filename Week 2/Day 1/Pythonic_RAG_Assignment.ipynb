At 7 it may seem \\nexcitingly ambitious to build huge things out of Lego, then at 14 to teach yourself calculus, till at \\n21 you\\'re starting to explore unanswered questions in physics. But always preserve \\nexcitingness.\\nThere\\'s a kind of excited curiosity that\\'s both the engine and the rudder of great work. It will not \\nonly drive you, but if you let it have its way, will also show you what to work on.\\nWhat are you excessively curious about — curious to a degree that would bore most other \\npeople?

This takes some skill, because your brain wants to ignore such \\ngaps in order to make a simpler model of the world. Many discoveries have come from asking \\nquestions about things that everyone else took for granted. [2]\\nIf the answers seem strange, so much the better.

[3]\\nFour steps: choose a field, learn enough to get to the frontier, notice gaps, explore promising \\nones. This is how practically everyone who's done great work has done it, from painters to \\nphysicists.\\nSteps two and four will require hard work. It may not be possible to prove that you have to work \\nhard to do great things, but the empirical evidence is on the scale of the evidence for mortality. \\nThat's why it's essential to work on something you're deeply interested in. Interest will drive you \\nto work harder than mere diligence \", \"irical evidence is on the scale of the evidence for mortality. \\nThat's why it's essential to work on something you're deeply interested in. Interest will drive you \\nto work harder than mere diligence ever could.\\nThe three most powerful motives are curiosity, delight, and the desire to do something \\nimpressive. Sometimes they converge, and that combination is the most powerful of all.\\nThe big prize is to discover a new fractal bud. You notice a crack in the surface of knowledge, \\npry it open, and there's a whole world inside.\\nLet's talk a little more about the complicated business of figuring out what to work on. The main \\nreason it's hard is that you can't tell what most kinds of work are like except by doing them. \\nWhich means the four steps overlap: you may have to work at something for years before you \\nknow how much you like it or how good you are at it. And in the meantime you're not doing, and \\nthus not learning about, most other kinds of work.

And in the meantime you're not doing, and \\nthus not learning about, most other kinds of work. So in the worst case you choose late based \\non very incomplete information. [4]\\nThe nature of ambition exacerbates this problem. Ambition comes in two forms, one that \\nprecedes interest in the subject and one that grows out of it. Most people who do great work \\nhave a mix, and the more you have of the former, the harder it will be to decide what to do.\\nThe educational systems in most countries pretend it's easy. They expect you to commit to a \\nfield long before you could know what it's really like. And as a result an ambitious person on an \\noptimal trajectory will often read to the system as an instance of breakage.\\nIt would be better if they at least admitted it — if they admitted that the system not only can't do \\nmuch to help you figure out what to work on, but is designed on the assumption that you'll \\nsomehow magically\", \" better if they at least admitted it — if they admitted that the system not only can't do \\nmuch to help you figure out what to work on, but is designed on the assumption that you'll \\nsomehow magically guess as a teenager. They don't tell you, but I will: when it comes to figuring \\nout what to work on, you're on your own. Some people get lucky and do guess correctly, but the \\nrest will find themselves scrambling diagonally across tracks laid down on the assumption that \\neveryone does.\\nWhat should you do if you're young and ambitious but don't know what to work on? What you \\nshould not do is drift along passively, assuming the problem will solve itself. You need to take \\naction. But there is no systematic procedure you can follow. When you read biographies of \\npeople who've done great work, it's remarkable how much luck is involved. They discover what \\nto work on as a result of a chance meeting, or by reading a book they happen to pick up.

They discover what \\nto work on as a result of a chance meeting, or by reading a book they happen to pick up. So \\nyou need to make yourself a big target for luck, and the way to do that is to be curious. Try lots \\nof things, meet lots of people, read lots of books, ask lots of questions. [5]\\nWhen in doubt, optimize for interestingness. Fields change as you learn more about them. What \\nmathematicians do, for example, is very different from what you do in high school math classes. \\nSo you need to give different types of work a chance to show you what they're like. But a field \\nshould become increasingly interesting as you learn more about it. If it doesn't, it's probably not \\nfor you.\\nDon't worry if you find you're interested in different things than other people. The stranger your \\ntastes in interestingness, the better.

If in the course of working on one thing \\nyou discover another that's more exciting, don't be afraid to switch.\\nIf you're making something for people, make sure it's something they actually want. The best \\nway to do this is to make something you yourself want. Write the story you want to read; build \\nthe tool you want to use.

Obviously the most exciting story to write will be \\nthe one you want to read. The reason I mention this case explicitly is that so many people get it \\nwrong. Instead of making what they want, they try to make what some imaginary, more \\nsophisticated audience wants. And once you go down that route, you're lost.

But there will also be plenty of times when things aren\\'t like \\nthat.\\nYou don\\'t just put out your sail and get blown forward by inspiration. There are headwinds and \\ncurrents and hidden shoals. So there\\'s a technique to working, just as there is to sailing.\\nFor example, while you must work hard, it\\'s possible to work too hard, and if you do that you\\'ll \\nfind you get diminishing returns: fatigue will make you stupid, and eventually even damage your \\nhealth. The point at which work yields diminishing returns depends on the type.

Some of the \\nhardest types you might only be able to do for four or five hours a day.\\nIdeally those hours will be contiguous. To the extent you can, try to arrange your life so you \\nhave big blocks of time to work in. You'll shy away from hard tasks if you know you might be \\ninterrupted.\\nIt will probably be harder to start working than to keep working. You'll often have to trick yourself \\nto get over that initial threshold. Don't worry about this; it's the nature of work, not a flaw in your \\ncharacter. Work has a sort of activation energy, both per day and per project. And since this \\nthreshold is fake in the sense that it's higher than the energy required to keep going, it's ok to \\ntell yourself a lie of corresponding magnitude to get over it.\\nIt's usually a mistake to lie to yourself if you wan\", 'ke in the sense that it\\'s higher than the energy required to keep going, it\\'s ok to \\ntell yourself a lie of corresponding magnitude to get over it.\\nIt\\'s usually a mistake to lie to yourself if you want to do great work, but this is one of the rare \\ncases where it isn\\'t. When I\\'m reluctant to start work in the morning, I often trick myself by \\nsaying \"I\\'ll just read over what I\\'ve got so far.\" Five minutes later I\\'ve found something that \\nseems mistaken or incomplete, and I\\'m off.\\nSimilar techniques work for starting new projects. It\\'s ok to lie to yourself about how much work \\na project will entail, for example. Lots of great things began with someone saying \"How hard \\ncould it be?\"\\nThis is one case where the young have an advantage.

In many projects a lot of the \\nbest work happens in what was meant to be the final stage.\\nAnother permissible lie is to exaggerate the importance of what you're working on, at least in \\nyour own mind. If that helps you discover something new, it may turn out not to have been a lie \\nafter all. [7]\\nSince there are two senses of starting work — per day and per project — there are also two \\nforms of procrastination. Per-project procrastination is far the more dangerous. You put off \\nstarting that ambitious project from year to year because the time isn't quite right. When you're \\nprocrastinating in units of years, you can get a lot not done. [8]\\nOne reason per-project procrastination is so dangerous is that it usually camouflages itsel\", \" the time isn't quite right. When you're \\nprocrastinating in units of years, you can get a lot not done. [8]\\nOne reason per-project procrastination is so dangerous is that it usually camouflages itself as \\nwork. You're not just sitting around doing nothing; you're working industriously on something \\nelse. So per-project procrastination doesn't set off the alarms that per-day procrastination does. \\nYou're too busy to notice it.\\nThe way to beat it is to stop occasionally and ask yourself: Am I working on what I most want to \\nwork on? When you're young it's ok if the answer is sometimes no, but this gets increasingly \\ndangerous as you get older. [9]\\nGreat work usually entails spending what would seem to most people an unreasonable amount \\nof time on a problem. You can't think of this time as a cost, or it will seem too high. You have to \\nfind the work sufficiently engaging as it's happening.\\nThere may be some jobs where you have to work diligently for years at things you hate before \\nyou \", \"a cost, or it will seem too high. You have to \\nfind the work sufficiently engaging as it's happening.\\nThere may be some jobs where you have to work diligently for years at things you hate before \\nyou get to the good part, but this is not how great work happens. Great work happens by \\nfocusing consistently on something you're genuinely interested in. When you pause to take \\nstock, you're surprised how far you've come.\\nThe reason we're surprised is that we underestimate the cumulative effect of work. Writing a \\npage a day doesn't sound like much, but if you do it every day you'll write a book a year. That's \\nthe key: consistency. People who do great things don't get a lot done every day. They get \\nsomething done, rather than nothing.\\nIf you do work that compounds, you'll get exponential growth. Most people who do this do it \\nunconsciously, but it's worth stopping to think about.

Growing \\nan audience is another: the more fans you have, the more new fans they'll bring you.\\nThe trouble with exponential growth is that the curve feels flat in the beginning. It isn't; it's still a \\nwonderful exponential curve. But we can't grasp that intuitively, so we underrate exponential \\ngrowth in its early stages.\\nSomething that grows exponentially can become so valuable that it's worth making an \\nextraordinary effort to get it started. But since we underrate exponential growth early on, this \\ntoo is mostly done unconsciously: people push through the initial, unrewarding phase of \\nlearning something new because they know from experience that learning new things always \\ntakes an initial push, or they grow their audience one fan at a time because they have nothing \\nb\", \"ng phase of \\nlearning something new because they know from experience that learning new things always \\ntakes an initial push, or they grow their audience one fan at a time because they have nothing \\nbetter to do.

There's a kind of undirected thinking you do \\nwhen walking or taking a shower or lying in bed that can be very powerful. By letting your mind \\nwander a little, you'll often solve problems you were unable to solve by frontal attack.\\nYou have to be working hard in the normal way to benefit from this phenomenon, though. You \\ncan't just walk around daydreaming. The daydreaming has to be interleaved with deliberate \\nwork that feeds it questions.

So avoid the kind of distraction that pushes your work out of the top spot, or \\nyou'll waste this valuable type of thinking on the distraction instead. (Exception: Don't avoid \\nlove.)\\nConsciously cultivate your taste in the work done in your field. Until you know which is the best \\nand what makes it so, you don't know what you're aiming for.\\nAnd that is what you're aiming for, because if you don't try to be the best, you won't even be \\ngood.

[11]\\nFortunately there's a kind of economy of scale here. Though it might seem like you'd be taking \\non a heavy burden by trying to be the best, in practice you often end up net ahead.

[13]\\nAnother more subtle component of earnestness is informality. Informality is much more \\nimportant than its grammatically negative name implies. It's not merely the absence of \\nsomething. It means focusing on what matters instead of what doesn't.\\nWhat formality and affectation have in common is that as well as doing the work, you're trying to \\nseem a certain way as you're doing it.

You don't have enough margin for error to accommodate the \\ndistortions introduced by being affected, intellectually dishonest, orthodox, fashionable, or cool. \\n[14]\\nGreat work is consistent not only with who did it, but with itself.

One of the biggest misconceptions about new ideas is about the ratio of \\nquestion to answer in their composition. People think big ideas are answers, but often the real \\ninsight was in the question.\\nPart of the reason we underrate questions is the way they're used in schools. In schools they \\ntend to exist only briefly before being answered, like unstable particles. But a really good \\nquestion can be much more than that. A really good question is a partial discovery. How do new \\nspecies arise? Is the force that makes objects fall to earth the same as the one that keeps \\nplanets in their orbits?

But the more \\nyou're carrying, the greater the chance of noticing a solution — or perhaps even more \\nexcitingly, noticing that two unanswered questions are the same.\\nSometimes you carry a question for a long time. Great work often comes from returning to a \\nquestion you first noticed years before — in your childhood, even — and couldn't stop thinking \\nabout. People talk a lot about the importance of keeping your youthful dreams alive, but it's just \\nas important to keep your youthful questions alive.

You have to be comfortable enough with the \\nworld being full of puzzles that you're willing to see them, but not so comfortable that you don't \\nwant to solve them. [20]\\nIt's a great thing to be rich in unanswered questions.

Which is easier when starting means \\nstarting small; those two ideas fit together like two puzzle pieces.\\nHow do you get from starting small to doing something great?

We're so used to schools that \\nwe unconsciously treat going to school as identical with learning, but in fact schools have all \\nsorts of strange qualities that warp our ideas about learning and thinking.\\nFor example, schools induce passivity.

If you're still in school, try thinking of your \\neducation as your project, and your teachers as working for you rather than vice versa. That \\nmay seem a stretch, but it's not merely some weird thought experiment. It's the truth, \\neconomically, and in the best case it's the truth intellectually as well. The best teachers don't \\nwant to be your bosses.

There\\'s nothing inherently bad about that. \\nThere\\'s no better way to learn how something works than by trying to reproduce it. Nor does \\ncopying necessarily make your work unoriginal. Originality is the presence of new ideas, not the \\nabsence of old ones.\\nThere\\'s a good way to copy and a bad way. If you\\'re going to copy something, do it openly \\ninstead of furtively, or worse still, unconsciously.

But at the other extreme, \\ncopying can be a sign of superiority rather than subordination. [25]\\nIn many fields it\\'s almost inevitable that your early work will be in some sense based on other \\npeople\\'s. Projects rarely arise in a vacuum. They\\'re usually a reaction to previous work. When \\nyou\\'re first starting out, you don\\'t have any previous work; if you\\'re going to react to something, \\nit has to be someone else\\'s. Once you\\'re established, you can react to your own.

But I didn't know it when we started YC. I \\nonly had a few data points: our own startup, and those started by friends.

You get a lot of data. Not just because you\\'re looking at more \\ncompanies, but also because more goes wrong.\\nBut knowing (nearly) all the problems startups can encounter doesn\\'t mean that advising them \\ncan be automated, or reduced to a formula. There\\'s no substitute for individual office hours with \\na YC partner. Each startup is unique, which means they have to be advised by specific partners \\nwho know them well.

This worked fine up to 60 startups, but when the batch grew to 80, everything broke. \\nThe founders probably didn\\'t realize anything was wrong, but the partners were confused and \\nunhappy because halfway through the batch they still didn\\'t know all the companies yet. [2]\\nAt first I was puzzled. How could things be fine at 60 startups and broken at 80? It was only a \\nthird more. Then I realized what had happened. We were using an O(n2) algorithm. So of \\ncourse it blew up.\\nThe solution we adopted was the classic one in these situations. We sharded the batch into \\nsmaller groups of startups, each overseen by a dedicated group of partners.

For example (and this case is all too common), \\nfounders will come in to talk about the difficulties they\\'re having raising money, and after digging \\ninto their situation, it turns out the reason is that the company is doing badly, and investors can \\ntell.

There have \\nbeen times when I\\'ve asked \"Would you use this yourself, if you hadn\\'t built it?\" and the \\nfounders, on thinking about it, said \"No.\" Well, there\\'s the reason you\\'re having trouble getting \\nusers.\\nOften founders know what their problems are, but not their relative importance. [3] They\\'ll come \\nin to talk about three problems they\\'re worrying about. One is of moderate importance, one \\ndoesn\\'t matter at all, and one will kill the company if it isn\\'t addressed immediately. It\\'s like \\nwatching one of those horror movies where the heroine is deeply upset that her boyfriend \\ncheated on her, and only mildly curious about the door that\\'s mysteriously ajar. You want to say: \\nnever mind about your boyfriend, think about that door! Fortunately in office hours you can. So \\nwhile startups still die with some regularity, it\\'s rarely because they', 'riously ajar. You want to say: \\nnever mind about your boyfriend, think about that door! Fortunately in office hours you can. So \\nwhile startups still die with some regularity, it\\'s rarely because they wandered into a room \\ncontaining a murderer. The YC partners can warn them where the murderers are.\\nNot that founders listen. That was another big surprise: how often founders don\\'t listen to us. A \\ncouple weeks ago I talked to a partner who had been working for YC for a couple batches and \\nwas starting to see the pattern. \"They come back a year later,\" she said, \"and say \\'We wish \\nwe\\'d listened to you.\\'\"\\nIt took me a long time to figure out why founders don\\'t listen. At first I thought it was mere \\nstubbornness. That\\'s part of the reason, but another and probably more important reason is \\nthat so much about startups is counterintuitive. And when you tell someone something \\ncounterintuitive, what it sounds to them is wrong. So the reason founders don\\'t listen to us is \\nthat they don\\'t bel', \"at so much about startups is counterintuitive. And when you tell someone something \\ncounterintuitive, what it sounds to them is wrong. So the reason founders don't listen to us is \\nthat they don't believe us. At least not till experience teaches them otherwise. [4]\\nThe reason startups are so counterintuitive is that they're so different from most people's other \\nexperiences. No one knows what it's like except those who've done it. Which is why YC \\npartners should usually have been founders themselves. But strangely enough, the \\ncounterintuitiveness of startups turns out to be another of the things that make YC work. If it \\nweren't counterintuitive, founders wouldn't need our advice about how to do it.\\nFocus is doubly important for early stage startups, because not only do they have a hundred \\ndifferent problems, they don't have anyone to work on them except the founders. If the founders \\nfocus on things that don't matter, there's no one focusing on the things that do. So the essence \\no\", \"ed \\ndifferent problems, they don't have anyone to work on them except the founders. If the founders \\nfocus on things that don't matter, there's no one focusing on the things that do. So the essence \\nof what happens at YC is to figure out which problems matter most, then cook up ideas for \\nsolving them — ideally at a resolution of a week or less — and then try those ideas and \\nmeasure how well they worked. The focus is on action, with measurable, near-term results.\\nThis doesn't imply that founders should rush forward regardless of the consequences. If you \\ncorrect course at a high enough frequency, you can be simultaneously decisive at a micro scale \\nand tentative at a macro scale. The result is a somewhat winding path, but executed very \\nrapidly, like the path a running back takes downfield. And in practice there's less backtracking \\nthan you might expect.

And when \\nthey guess wrong, they notice fast, because they'll talk about the results at office hours the next \\nweek. [5]\\nA small improvement in navigational ability can make you a lot faster, because it has a double \\neffect: the path is shorter, and you can travel faster along it when you're more certain it's the \\nright one. That's where a lot of YC's value lies, in helping founders get an extra increment of \\nfocus that lets them move faster. And since moving fast is the essence of a startup, YC in effect \\nmakes startups more startup-like.\\nSpeed defines startups. Focus enables speed.

Partly because startups almost by definition are \\ndoing something new, which means no one knows how to do it yet, or in most cases even what \\n\"it\" is. Partly because startups are so counterintuitive generally. And partly because many \\nfounders, especially young and ambitious ones, have been trained to win the wrong way. That \\ntook me years to figure out. The educational system in most countries trains you to win by \\nhacking the test instead of actually doing whatever it\\'s supposed to measure. But that stops \\nworking when you start a startup. So part of what YC does is to retrain founders to stop trying \\nto hack the test. (It takes a surprisingly long time. A year in, you still see them reverting to their \\nold habits.)\\nYC is not simply more experienced founders passing on their knowledge. It\\'s more like \\nspecialization than apprenticeship.

It's more like \\nspecialization than apprenticeship. The knowledge of the YC partners and the founders have \\ndifferent shapes: It wouldn't be worthwhile for a founder to acquire the encyclopedic knowledge \\nof startup problems that a YC partner has, just as it wouldn't be worthwhile for a YC partner to \\nacquire the depth of domain knowledge that a founder has. That's why it can still be valuable for \\nan experienced founder to do YC, just as it can still be valuable for an experienced athlete to \\nhave a coach.\\nThe other big thing YC gives founders is colleagues, and this may be even more important than \\nthe advice of partners. If you look at history, great work clusters around certain places and \\ninstitutions: Florence in the late 15th century, the University of Gÿýttingen in the late 19th, The \\nNew Yorker under Ross, Bell Labs, Xerox PARC.

However good you are, good colleagues make \\nyou better. Indeed, very ambitious people probably need colleagues more than anyone else, \\nbecause they're so starved for them in everyday life.\\nWhether or not YC manages one day to be listed alongside those famous clusters, it won't be \\nfor lack of trying. We were very aware of this historical phenomenon and deliberately designed \\nYC to be one. By this point it's not bragging to say that it's the biggest cluster of great startup \\nfounders. Even people trying to attack YC concede that.\\nColleagues and startup founders are two of the most powerful forces in the world, so you'd \\nexpect it to have a big effect to combine them. Before YC, to the extent people thought about \\nthe question at all, most assumed they couldn't be combined — that loneliness was the price of \\nindependence.

There was no one we could commiserate with about the misbehavior of investors, or \\nspeculate with about the future of technology. I often tell founders to make something they \\nthemselves want, and YC is certainly that: it was designed to be exactly what we wanted when \\nwe were starting a startup.\\nOne thing we wanted was to be able to get seed funding without having to make the rounds of \\nrandom rich people.

To remain on, he had only to avoid the three unforgivable sins: \\ncrime, heresy, and marriage. [1] Th\", 'ity College: Supported comfortably, Newton was free to devote himself \\nwholly to whatever he chose. To remain on, he had only to avoid the three unforgivable sins: \\ncrime, heresy, and marriage. [1] The first time I read that, in the 1990s, it sounded amusingly \\nmedieval. How strange, to have to avoid committing heresy. But when I reread it 20 years later it \\nsounded like a description of contemporary employment.\\nThere are an ever-increasing number of opinions you can be fired for. Those doing the firing \\ndon\\'t use the word \"heresy\" to describe them, but structurally they\\'re equivalent. Structurally \\nthere are two distinctive things about heresy: (1) that it takes priority over the question of truth \\nor falsity, and (2) that it outweighs everything else the speaker has done.\\nFor example, when someone calls a statement \"x-ist,\" they\\'re also implicitly saying that this is \\nthe end of the discussion. They do not, having said this, go on to consider whether the \\nstatement is true or not. Us', 'en someone calls a statement \"x-ist,\" they\\'re also implicitly saying that this is \\nthe end of the discussion. They do not, having said this, go on to consider whether the \\nstatement is true or not. Using such labels is the conversational equivalent of signalling an \\nexception. That\\'s one of the reasons they\\'re used: to end a discussion.\\nIf you find yourself talking to someone who uses these labels a lot, it might be worthwhile to ask \\nthem explicitly if they believe any babies are being thrown out with the bathwater. Can a \\nstatement be x-ist, for whatever value of x, and also true? If the answer is yes, then they\\'re \\nadmitting to banning the truth. That\\'s obvious enough that I\\'d guess most would answer no. But \\nif they answer no, it\\'s easy to show that they\\'re mistaken, and that in practice such labels are \\napplied to statements regardless of their truth or falsity.\\nThe clearest evidence of this is that whether a statement is considered x-ist often depends on \\nwho said it. Truth doesn', \"ce such labels are \\napplied to statements regardless of their truth or falsity.\\nThe clearest evidence of this is that whether a statement is considered x-ist often depends on \\nwho said it. Truth doesn't work that way. The same statement can't be true when one person \\nsays it, but x-ist, and therefore false, when another person does. [2]\\nThe other distinctive thing about heresies, compared to ordinary opinions, is that the public \\nexpression of them outweighs everything else the speaker has done. In ordinary matters, like \\nknowledge of history, or taste in music, you're judged by the average of your opinions. A heresy \\nis qualitatively different. It's like dropping a chunk of uranium onto the scale.\\nBack in the day (and still, in some places) the punishment for heresy was death. You could have \\nled a life of exemplary goodness, but if you publicly doubted, say, the divinity of Christ, you were \\ngoing to burn.

Nowadays, in civilized countries, heretics only get fired in the metaphorical \\nsense, by losing their jobs. But the structure of the situation is the same: the heresy outweighs \\neverything else. You could have spent the last ten years saving children's lives, but if you \\nexpress certain opinions, you're automatically fired.\\nIt's much the same as if you committed a crime. No matter how virtuously you've lived, if you \\ncommit a crime, you must still suffer the penalty of the law. Having lived a previously blameless \\nlife might mitigate the punishment, but it doesn't affect whether you're guilty or not.\\nA heresy is an opinion whose expression is treated like a crime — one that makes some people \\nfeel not merely that you're mistaken, but that you should be punished.

But there \\nare a lot more now than there were a few decades ago, and even those who are happy about \\nthis would have to agree that it's so.\\nWhy? Why has this antiquated-sounding religious concept come back in a secular form? And \\nwhy now?\\nYou need two ingredients for a wave of intolerance: intolerant people, and an ideology to guide \\nthem. The intolerant people are always there.

The short \\nversion is that people can be classified in two dimensions according to (1) how independent- or \\nconventional-minded they are, and (2) how aggressive they are about it. The aggressively \\nconventional-minded are the enforcers of orthodoxy.\\nNormally they're only locally visible. They're the grumpy, censorious people in a group — the \\nones who are always first to complain when something violates the current rules of propriety. \\nBut occasionally, like a vector field whose elements become aligned, a large number of \\naggressively conventional-minded people unite behind some ideology all at once.

Though initiated \\nby Mao to undermine his rivals, the Cultural Revolution was otherwise mostly a grass-roots \\nphenomenon. Mao said in essence: There are heretics among us. Seek them out and punish \\nthem. And that's all the aggressively conventional-minded ever need to hear. They went at it \\nwith the delight of dogs chasing squirrels.\\nTo unite the conventional-minded, an ideology must have many of the features of a religion. In \\nparticular it must have strict and arbitrary rules that adherents can demonstrate their purity by \\nobeying, and its adherents must believe that anyone who obeys these rules is ipso facto morally \\nsuperior to anyone who doesn't. [3]\\nI\", \"d arbitrary rules that adherents can demonstrate their purity by \\nobeying, and its adherents must believe that anyone who obeys these rules is ipso facto morally \\nsuperior to anyone who doesn't. [3]\\nIn the late 1980s a new ideology of this type appeared in US universities. It had a very strong \\ncomponent of moral purity, and the aggressively conventional-minded seized upon it with their \\nusual eagerness — all the more because the relaxation of social norms in the preceding \\ndecades meant there had been less and less to forbid. The resulting wave of intolerance has \\nbeen eerily similar in form to the Cultural Revolution, though fortunately much smaller in \\nmagnitude. [4]\\nI've deliberately avoided mentioning any specific heresies here. Partly because one of the \\nuniversal tactics of heretic hunters, now as in the past, is to accuse those who disapprove of the \\nway in which they suppress ideas of being heretics themselves.

I want this essay to \\nwork in the future, not just now. And unfortunately it probably will. The aggressively \\nconventional-minded will always be among us, looking for things to forbid. All they need is an \\nideology to tell them what. And it's unlikely the current one will be the last.\\nThere are aggressively conventional-minded people on both the right and the left.

Instead it has decreased. \\n[5]\\nThe situation is similar to what's happened with infectious diseases like measles. Anyone \\nlooking into the future in 2010 would have expected the number of measles cases in the US to \\ncontinue to decrease. Instead, thanks to anti-vaxxers, it has increased.

The point to start worrying is presumably when their efforts start to spill over into \\neveryone else's lives. And in both cases that does seem to be happening.\\nSo it's probably worth spending some amount of effort on pushing back to keep open the \\nwindow of free expression. My hope is that this essay will help form social antibodies not just \\nagainst current efforts to suppress ideas, but against the concept of heresy in general. That's \\nthe real prize.

This passage is the same in both.\\n[2] Another more subtle but equally damning bit of evidence is that claims of x-ism are never qualified.

And your ideas won't just be imprecise, but incomplete too. Half the ideas that end up in \\nan essay will be ones you thought of while you were writing it.

Presumably there were others that turned out to be too broken to fix, and those you \\ndiscarded instead.\\nIt's not just having to commit your ideas to specific words that makes writing so exacting. The \\nreal test is reading what you've written. You have to pretend to be a neutral reader who knows \\nnothing of what's in your head, only what you wrote. When he reads what you wrote, does it \\nseem correct? Does it seem complete?

If he's not satisfied because you failed to mention x or didn't \\nqualify some sentence sufficiently, then you mention x or add more qualifications. Happy now? \\nIt may cost you some nice sentences, but you have to resign yourself to that. You just have to \\nmake them as good as you can and still satisfy the stranger.\\nThis much, I assume, won't be that controversial. I think it will accord with the experience of \\nanyone who has tried to write about anything nontrivial. There may exist people whose thoughts \\nare so perfectly formed that they just flow straight into words.

At best the plan is \\nvague and incomplete. Very likely there\\'s some undiscovered flaw that invalidates it completely. \\nAt best it\\'s a plan for a plan.\\nIn precisely defined domains it\\'s possible to form complete ideas in your head. People can play \\nchess in their heads, for example. And mathematicians can do some amount of math in their \\nheads, though they don\\'t seem to feel sure of a proof over a certain length till they write it down. \\nBut this only seems possible with ideas you can express in a formal language.

I'll sometimes think of a paragraph while walking or lying in bed that \\nsurvives nearly unchanged in the final version. But really I'm writing when I do this. I'm doing \\nthe mental part of writing; my fingers just aren't moving as I do it. [2]\\nYou can know a great deal about something without writing about it. Can you ever know so \\nmuch that you wouldn't learn more from trying to explain what you know? I don't think so. I've \\nwritten about at least two subjects I know well — Lisp hacking and startups — and in both \\ncases I learned a lot from writing about them.

A \\ngreat deal of knowledge is unconscious, and experts have if anything a higher proportion of \\nunconscious knowledge than beginners.\\nI'm not saying that writing is the best way to explore all ideas. If you have ideas about \\narchitecture, presumably the best way to explore them is to build actual buildings. What I'm \\nsaying is that however much you learn from exploring ideas in other ways, you'll still learn new \\nthings from writing about them.\\nPutting ideas into words doesn't have to mean writing, of course. You can also do it the old way, \\nby talking. But in my experience, writing is the stricter test. You have to commit to a single, \\noptimal sequence of words. Less can go unsaid when you don't have tone of voice to carry \\nmeaning. And you can focus in a way that would seem excessive in conversation.

If you did that in conversation it would \\nseem evidence of some kind of mental disorder. If you're lazy, of course, writing and talking are \\nequally useless. But if you want to push yourself to get things right, writing is the steeper hill. [3]\\nThe reason I've spent so long establishing this rather obvious point is that it leads to another \\nthat many people will find shocking. If writing down your ideas always makes them more precise \\nand more complete, then no one who hasn't written about a topic has fully formed ideas about \\nit.

And that means you have to discard the possibility of people being good at making it. \\nWhich means there's no way for artists to be good at their jobs. And not just visual artists, but \\nanyone who is in any sense an artist. You can't have good actors, or novelists, or composers, or \\ndancers either. You can have popular novelists, but not good ones.\\nWe don't realize how far we'd have to go if we discarded the concept of good taste, because we \\ndon't even debate the most obvious cases. But it doesn't just mean we can't say which of two \\nfamous painters is better. It means we can't say that any painter is better than a r\", \"od taste, because we \\ndon't even debate the most obvious cases. But it doesn't just mean we can't say which of two \\nfamous painters is better. It means we can't say that any painter is better than a randomly \\nchosen eight year old.\\nThat was how I realized my father was wrong. I started studying painting. And it was just like \\nother kinds of work I'd done: you could do it well, or badly, and if you tried hard, you could get \\nbetter at it. And it was obvious that Leonardo and Bellini were much better at it than me. That \\ngap between us was not imaginary. They were so good. And if they could be good, then art \\ncould be good, and there was such a thing as good taste after all.\\nNow that I've explained how to show there is such a thing as good taste, I should also explain \\nwhy people think there isn't. There are two reasons. One is that there's always so much \\ndisagreement about taste. Most people's response to art is a tangle of unexamined impulses. Is \\nthe artist famous? Is the subject att\", \" isn't. There are two reasons. One is that there's always so much \\ndisagreement about taste. Most people's response to art is a tangle of unexamined impulses. Is \\nthe artist famous? Is the subject attractive? Is this the sort of art they're supposed to like? Is it \\nhanging in a famous museum, or reproduced in a big, expensive book? In practice most \\npeople's response to art is dominated by such extraneous factors.\\nAnd the people who do claim to have good taste are so often mistaken. The paintings admired \\nby the so-called experts in one generation are often so different from those admired a few \\ngenerations later. It's easy to conclude there's nothing real there at all. It's only when you isolate \\nthis force, for example by trying to paint and comparing your work to Bellini's, that you can see \\nthat it does in fact exist.\\nThe other reason people doubt that art can be good is that there doesn't seem to be any room \\nin the art for this goodness. The argument goes like this. Imagine sever\", ' see \\nthat it does in fact exist.\\nThe other reason people doubt that art can be good is that there doesn\\'t seem to be any room \\nin the art for this goodness. The argument goes like this. Imagine several people looking at a \\nwork of art and judging how good it is. If being good art really is a property of objects, it should \\nbe in the object somehow. But it doesn\\'t seem to be; it seems to be something happening in the \\nheads of each of the observers. And if they disagree, how do you choose between them?\\nThe solution to this puzzle is to realize that the purpose of art is to work on its human audience, \\nand humans have a lot in common. And to the extent the things an object acts upon respond in \\nthe same way, that\\'s arguably what it means for the object to have the corresponding property. If \\neverything a particle interacts with behaves as if the particle had a mass of m, then it has a \\nmass of m. So the distinction between \"objective\" and \"subjective\" is not binary, but a matter of \\ndeg', ' \\neverything a particle interacts with behaves as if the particle had a mass of m, then it has a \\nmass of m. So the distinction between \"objective\" and \"subjective\" is not binary, but a matter of \\ndegree, depending on how much the subjects have in common. Particles interacting with one \\nanother are at one pole, but people interacting with art are not all the way at the other; their \\nreactions aren\\'t random.\\nBecause people\\'s responses to art aren\\'t random, art can be designed to operate on people, \\nand be good or bad depending on how effectively it does so. Much as a vaccine can be. If \\nsomeone were talking about the ability of a vaccine to confer immunity, it would seem very \\nfrivolous to object that conferring immunity wasn\\'t really a property of vaccines, because \\nacquiring immunity is something that happens in the immune system of each individual person. \\nSure, people\\'s immune systems vary, and a vaccine that worked on one might not work on \\nanother, but that doesn\\'t make it meaning', \"omething that happens in the immune system of each individual person. \\nSure, people's immune systems vary, and a vaccine that worked on one might not work on \\nanother, but that doesn't make it meaningless to talk about the effectiveness of a vaccine.\\nThe situation with art is messier, of course. You can't measure effectiveness by simply taking a \\nvote, as you do with vaccines. You have to imagine the responses of subjects with a deep \\nknowledge of art, and enough clarity of mind to be able to ignore extraneous influences like the \\nfame of the artist. And even then you'd still see some disagreement. People do vary, and \\njudging art is hard, especially recent art. There is definitely not a total order either of works or of \\npeople's ability to judge them. But there is equally definitely a partial order of both.

Being very smart was a necessary precondition for having those ideas, but the two are \\nnot identical.\\nIt may seem a hair-splitting distinction to point out that intelligence and its consequences are \\nnot identical, but it isn't.

Surely you'd \\ntake the latter. I would. The choice makes me uncomfortable, but when you see the two options \\nlaid out explicitly like that, it's obvious which is better.\\nThe reason the choice makes me uncomfortable is that being smart still feels like the thing that \\nmatters, even though I know intellectually that it isn't.

Intelligence wins in \\nconversation, and thus becomes the basis of the dominance hierarchy.

Clearly intelligence is not the only ingredient in \\nhaving new ideas. What are the other ingredients? Are they things we could cultivate?\\nBecause the trouble with intelligence, they say, is that it's mostly inborn. The evidence for this \\nseems fairly convincing, especially considering that most of us don't want it to be true, and the \\nevidence thus has to face a stiff headwind. But I'm not going to get into that question here, \\nbecause it's the other ingredients in new ideas that I care about, and it's clear that many of \\nthem can be cultivated.\\nThat means the truth is excitingly different from the story I got as a kid.

If intelligence is what \\nmatters, and also mostly inborn, the natural consequence is a sort of Brave New World fatalism. \\nThe best you can do is figure out what sort of work you have an \"aptitude\" for, so that whatever \\nintelligence you were born with will at least be put to the best use, and then work as hard as \\nyou can at it. Whereas if intelligence isn\\'t what matters, but only one of several ingredients in \\nwhat does, and many of those aren\\'t inborn, things get more interesting. You have a lot more \\ncontrol, but the problem of how to arrange your life becomes that much more complicated.\\nSo what are the other ingredients in having new ideas?

This is the \\nfirst time I've posed the question to myself this way, and I think it may take a while to answer. \\nBut I wrote recently about one of the most important: an obsessive interest in a particular topic. \\nAnd this can definitely be cultivated.\\nAnother quality you need in order to discover new ideas is independent-mindedness. I wouldn't \\nwant to claim that this is distinct from intelligence — I'd be reluctant to call someone smart who \\nwasn't independent-minded — but though largely inborn, this quality seems to be something \\nthat can be cultivated to some extent.\\nThere are general techniques for having new ideas — for example, for working on your own \\nprojects and for overcoming the\", \"rn, this quality seems to be something \\nthat can be cultivated to some extent.\\nThere are general techniques for having new ideas — for example, for working on your own \\nprojects and for overcoming the obstacles you face with early work — and these can all be \\nlearned.

And there are also collections of \\ntechniques for generating specific types of new ideas, like startup ideas and essay topics.\\nAnd of course there are a lot of fairly mundane ingredients in discovering new ideas, like \\nworking hard, getting enough sleep, avoiding certain kinds of stress, having the right \\ncolleagues, and finding tricks for working on what you want even when it's not what you're \\nsupposed to be working on. Anything that prevents people from doing great work has an \\ninverse that helps them to.

There\\'s a class of \\nnew ideas that are best discovered by writing essays and books. And that \"by\" is deliberate: you \\ndon\\'t think of the ideas first, and then merely write them down.

It ranges from mere aggressiveness at the bottom, through \\nquick-wittedness in the middle, to something closer to actual intelligence at the top, though probably always with \\nsome component of quick-wittedness.\\n[2] Just as intelligence isn't the only ingredient in having new ideas, having new ideas isn't the only thing intelligence \\nis useful for.

Anyone who's been to school \\nknows what it entails, even if they chose not to do it. There are 12 year olds who work \\namazingly hard. And yet when I ask if I know more about working hard now than when I was in \\nschool, the answer is definitely yes.\\nOne thing I know is that if you want to do great things, you'll have to work very hard. I wasn't \\nsure of that as a kid. Schoolwork varied in difficulty; one didn't always have to work super hard \\nto do well. And some of the things famous adults did, they seemed to do almost effortlessly. \\nWas there, perhaps, some way to evade hard work th\", ' difficulty; one didn\\'t always have to work super hard \\nto do well. And some of the things famous adults did, they seemed to do almost effortlessly. \\nWas there, perhaps, some way to evade hard work through sheer brilliance? Now I know the \\nanswer to that question. There isn\\'t.\\nThe reason some subjects seemed easy was that my school had low standards. And the \\nreason famous adults seemed to do things effortlessly was years of practice; they made it look \\neasy.\\nOf course, those famous adults usually had a lot of natural ability too. There are three \\ningredients in great work: natural ability, practice, and effort. You can do pretty well with just two, \\nbut to do the best work you need all three: you need great natural ability and to have practiced a \\nlot and to be trying very hard. [1]\\nBill Gates, for example, was among the smartest people in business in his era, but he was also \\namong the hardest working. \"I never took a day off in my twenties,\" he said. \"Not one.\" It was \\nsimilar with ', 'Gates, for example, was among the smartest people in business in his era, but he was also \\namong the hardest working. \"I never took a day off in my twenties,\" he said. \"Not one.\" It was \\nsimilar with Lionel Messi. He had great natural ability, but when his youth coaches talk about \\nhim, what they remember is not his talent but his dedication and his desire to win. P\\n. G. \\nWodehouse would probably get my vote for best English writer of the 20th century, if I had to \\nchoose. Certainly no one ever made it look easier. But no one ever worked harder. At 74, he \\nwrote with each new book of mine I have, as I say, the feeling that this time I have picked a \\nlemon in the garden of literature. A good thing, really, I suppose.

And yet Bill Gates sounds even more extreme. Not one day off in ten years? \\nThese two had about as much natural ability as anyone could have, and yet they also worked \\nabout as hard as anyone could work. You need both.\\nThat seems so obvious, and yet in practice we find it slightly hard to grasp. There's a faint xor \\nbetween talent and hard work. It comes partly from popular culture, where it seems to run very \\ndeep, and partly from the fact that the outliers are so rare. If great talent and great drive are \\nboth rare, then people with both are rare squared. Most people you meet who have a lot of one \\nwill have less of the other. But you'll need both if you want to be an outlier yourself. And since \\nyou can't really change how much natural talent you have, in practice doing great work, insofar \\nas you can, reduces to working very hard.\\nIt's straightforward to work hard if you have clearly defined, externally imposed goal\", \"ow much natural talent you have, in practice doing great work, insofar \\nas you can, reduces to working very hard.\\nIt's straightforward to work hard if you have clearly defined, externally imposed goals, as you do \\nin school. There is some technique to it: you have to learn not to lie to yourself, not to \\nprocrastinate (which is a form of lying to yourself), not to get distracted, and not to give up when \\nthings go wrong. But this level of discipline seems to be within the reach of quite young \\nchildren, if they want it.\\nWhat I've learned since I was a kid is how to work toward goals that are neither clearly defined \\nnor externally imposed.

As I grew older, this morphed into a feeling \\nof disgust when I wasn't achieving anything.

I had to learn what real \\nwork was before I could wholeheartedly desire to do it.

But as I \\nlearned the shape of real work, I found that my desire to do it slotted into it as if they'd been \\nmade for each other.\\nI suspect most people have to learn what work is before they can love it. Hardy wrote eloquently \\nabout this in A Mathematician's Apology: I do not remember having felt, as a boy, any passion \\nfor mathematics, and such notions as I may have had of the career of a mathematician were far \\nfrom noble.

Both the difficulty of the work and your ability to do it can vary hour to hour, so you need \\nto be constantly judging both how hard you're trying and how well you're doing.\\nTrying hard doesn't mean constantly pushing yourself to work, though. There may be some \\npeople who do, but I think my experience is fairly typical, and I only have to push myself \\noccasionally when I'm starting a project or when I encounter some sort of check. That's when \\nI'm in danger of procrastinating. But once I get rolling, I tend to keep going.\\nWhat keeps me going depends on the type of work.

[8]\\nThe difficulty of figuring out what to work on varies enormously from one person to another. \\nThat's one of the most important things I've learned about work since I was a kid. As a kid, you \\nget the impression that everyone has a calling, and all they have to do is figure out what it is. \\nThat's how it works in movies, and in the streamlined biographies fed to kids. Sometimes it \\nworks that way in real life. Some people figure out what to do as children and just do it, like \\nMozart. But others, like Newton, turn restlessly from one kind of work to another. Maybe in \\nretrospect we can identify one as their calling — we can wish Newton spent more time on math \\nand physics and less on alchemy and theology — but this is an illusion induced by hindsight \\nbias.

For these people, the process \\nI described earlier has a third component: along with measuring both how hard you're working \\nand how well you're doing, you have to think about whether you should keep working in this \\nfield or switch to another. If you're working hard but not getting good enough results, you should \\nswitch. It sounds simple expressed that way, but in practice it's very difficult.

You need to give \\nyourself time to get going. But how much time? And what should you do if work that was going \\nwell stops going well? How much time do you give yourself then? [9]\\nWhat even counts as good results? That can be really hard to decide. If you're exploring an \\narea few others have worked in, you may not even know what good results look like. History is \\nfull of examples of people who misjudged the importance of what they were working on.\\nThe best test of whether it's worthwhile to work on something is whether you find it interesting. \\nThat may sound like a dangerously subjective measure, but it's probably the most accurate one \\nyou're going to get.

Who's in a better position than you to \\njudge whether it's important, and what's a better predictor of its importance than whether it's \\ninteresting?\\nFor this test to work, though, you have to be honest with yourself. Indeed, that's the most \\nstriking thing about the whole question of working hard: how at each point it depends on being \\nhonest with yourself.\\nWorking hard is not just a dial you turn up to 11. It's a complicated, dynamic system that has to \\nbe tuned just right at each point. You have to understand the shape of real work, see clearly \\nwhat kind you're best suited for, aim as close to the true core of it as you can, accurately judge \\nat each moment both what you're capable of and how you're doing, and put in as many hours \\neach day as you can without harming the quality of the result.

And not because I'm an indulgent parent, but because I've been \\non the other end and I know which has more predictive value. When I was picking startups for Y \\nCombinator, I didn't care about applicants' grades. But if they'd worked on projects of their own, \\nI wanted to hear all about those.

Whenever I \\nhad to write a paper, that would become a project of my own — except in English classes, \\nironically, because the things one has to write in English classes are so bogus. And when I got \\nto college and started taking CS classes, the programs I had to write became projects of my \\nown. Whenever I was writing or programming, I was usually skating, and that has been true \\never since.\\nSo where exactly is the edge of projects of one's own? That's an interesting questio\", \"jects of my \\nown. Whenever I was writing or programming, I was usually skating, and that has been true \\never since.\\nSo where exactly is the edge of projects of one's own? That's an interesting question, partly \\nbecause the answer is so complicated, and partly because there's so much at stake. There turn \\nout to be two senses in which work can be one's own: 1) that you're doing it voluntarily, rather \\nthan merely because someone told you to, and 2) that you're doing it by yourself.\\nThe edge of the former is quite sharp. People who care a lot about their work are usually very \\nsensitive to the difference between pulling, and being pushed, and work tends to fall into one \\ncategory or the other. But the test isn't simply whether you're told to do something. You can \\nchoose to do something you're told to do. Indeed, you can own it far more thoroughly than the \\nperson who told you to do it.\\nFor example, math homework is for most people something they're told to do. But for my father, \\nwho wa\", \"re told to do. Indeed, you can own it far more thoroughly than the \\nperson who told you to do it.\\nFor example, math homework is for most people something they're told to do. But for my father, \\nwho was a mathematician, it wasn't. Most of us think of the problems in a math book as a way \\nto test or develop our knowledge of the material explained in each section. But to my father the \\nproblems were the part that mattered, and the text was merely a sort of annotation. Whenever \\nhe got a new math book it was to him like being given a puzzle: here was a new set of problems \\nto solve, and he'd immediately set about solving all of them.\\nThe other sense of a project being one's own — working on it by oneself — has a much softer \\nedge. It shades gradually into collaboration. And interestingly, it shades into collaboration in two \\ndifferent ways. One way to collaborate is to share a single project. For example, when two \\nmathematicians collaborate on a proof that takes shape in the course of a c\", \"hades into collaboration in two \\ndifferent ways. One way to collaborate is to share a single project. For example, when two \\nmathematicians collaborate on a proof that takes shape in the course of a conversation \\nbetween them. The other way is when multiple people work on separate projects of their own \\nthat fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. For example, when one person writes the text of a book \\nand another does the graphic design. [3]\\nThese two paths into collaboration can of course be combined. But under the right conditions, \\nthe excitement of working on a project of one's own can be preserved for quite a while before \\ndisintegrating into the turbulent flow of work in a large organization. Indeed, the history of \\nsuccessful organizations is partly the history of techniques for preserving that excitement. [4]\\nThe team that made the original Macintosh were a great example of this phenomenon. People \\nlike Burrell Smith and Andy Hertzfeld and Bill Atkinson and Susan Kare were not just\", 'ing that excitement. [4]\\nThe team that made the original Macintosh were a great example of this phenomenon. People \\nlike Burrell Smith and Andy Hertzfeld and Bill Atkinson and Susan Kare were not just following \\norders. They were not tennis balls hit by Steve Jobs, but rockets let loose by Steve Jobs. There \\nwas a lot of collaboration between them, but they all seem to have individually felt the \\nexcitement of working on a project of one\\'s own.\\nIn Andy Hertzfeld\\'s book on the Macintosh, he describes how they\\'d come back into the office \\nafter dinner and work late into the night. People who\\'ve never experienced the thrill of working \\non a project they\\'re excited about can\\'t distinguish this kind of working long hours from the kind \\nthat happens in sweatshops and boiler rooms, but they\\'re at opposite ends of the spectrum. \\nThat\\'s why it\\'s a mistake to insist dogmatically on \"work/life balance.\" Indeed, the mere \\nexpression \"work/life\" embodies a mistake: it assumes work and life are dist', ' opposite ends of the spectrum. \\nThat\\'s why it\\'s a mistake to insist dogmatically on \"work/life balance.\" Indeed, the mere \\nexpression \"work/life\" embodies a mistake: it assumes work and life are distinct. For those to \\nwhom the word \"work\" automatically implies the dutiful plodding kind, they are. But for the \\nskaters, the relationship between work and life would be better represented by a dash than a \\nslash. I wouldn\\'t want to work on anything that I didn\\'t want to take over my life.\\nOf course, it\\'s easier to achieve this level of motivation when you\\'re making something like the \\nMacintosh. It\\'s easy for something new to feel like a project of your own. That\\'s one of the \\nreasons for the tendency programmers have to rewrite things that don\\'t need rewriting, and to \\nwrite their own versions of things that already exist.

Indeed, it may be one of the advantages of capitalism that it \\nencourages such rewriting. A company that needs software to do something can't use the \\nsoftware already written to do it at another company, and thus has to write their own, which \\noften turns out better. [5]\\nThe natural alignment between skating and solving new problems is one of the reasons the \\npayoffs from startups are so high.

If you can \\nfind the right people, you only have to tell them what to do at the highest level. They'll handle \\nthe details. Indeed, they insist on it. For a project to feel like your own, you must have sufficient \\nautonomy. You can't be working to order, or slowed down by bureaucracy.\\nOne way to ensure autonomy is not to have a boss at all.

It\\'s harder when they\\'re \\nnot. And the hardest part, usually, is morale. That\\'s where adults have it harder than kids. Kids \\njust plunge in and build their treehouse without worrying about whether they\\'re wasting their \\ntime, or how it compares to other treehouses. And frankly we could learn a lot from kids here. \\nThe high standards most grownups have for \"real\" work do not always serve us well.\\nThe most important phase in a project of one\\'s own is at the beginning: when you go from \\nthinking it might be cool to do x to actually doing x.

Fierceness seems optional there. Darwin for example doesn't seem to \\nhave been especially fierce. Whereas it's impossible to be the CEO of a company over a certain \\nsize without being fierce, so now that nerds can win at business, fierce nerds will increasingly \\nmonopolize the really big successes.\\nThe bad news is that if it's not exercised, your fierceness will turn to bitterness, and you will \\nbecome an intellectual playground bully: the grumpy sysadmin, the forum troll, the hater, the \\nshooter down of new ideas.\\nHow do you avoid this fate?

[1]\\nSuch ideas are not merely unsafe to dismiss, but disproportionately likely to be interesting. \\nWhen the average person proposes an implausible-sounding idea, its implausibility is evidence \\nof their incompetence. But when a reasonable domain expert does it, the situation is reversed. \\nThere's something like an efficient market here: on average the ideas that seem craziest will, if \\ncorrect, have the biggest effect. So if you can eliminate the theory that the person proposing an \\nimplausible-sounding idea is incompetent, its implausibility switches from evidence that it's \\nboring to evidence that it's exciting. [2]\\nSuch ideas are not guaranteed to work. But they don't have to be.

I think if you bet on the entire set of implausible-sounding ideas proposed by reasonable \\ndomain experts, you\\'d end up net ahead.\\nThe reason is that everyone is too conservative. The word \"paradigm\" is overused, but this is a \\ncase where it\\'s warranted. Everyone is too much in the grip of the current paradigm. Even the \\npeople who have the new ideas undervalue them initially. Which means that before they reach \\nthe stage of proposing them publicly, they\\'ve already subjected them to an excessively strict \\nfilter. [3]\\nThe wise response to such an idea is not to make statements, but to ask questions, because \\nthere\\'s a real mystery here.

[3]\\nThe wise response to such an idea is not to make statements, but to ask questions, because \\nthere's a real mystery here. Why has this smart and reasonable person proposed an idea that \\nseems so wrong? Are they mistaken, or are you? One of you has to be. If you're the one who's \\nmistaken, that would be good to know, because it means there's a hole in your model of the \\nworld. But even if they're mistaken, it should be interesting to learn why. A trap that an expert \\nfalls into is one you have to worry about too.\\nThis all seems pretty obvious. And yet there are clearly a lot of people who don't share my fear \\nof dismissing new ideas. Why do they do it? Why risk looking like a jerk now and a fool later, \\ninstead of just reserving judgement?\\nOne reason they do it is envy. If you propose a radical new idea and it succeeds, your \\nreputation (and perhaps also your wealth) will increase proportionally. Some people would be \\nenvious if that happened, a\", \"n they do it is envy. If you propose a radical new idea and it succeeds, your \\nreputation (and perhaps also your wealth) will increase proportionally. Some people would be \\nenvious if that happened, and this potential envy propagates back into a conviction that you \\nmust be wrong.\\nAnother reason people dismiss new ideas is that it's an easy way to seem sophisticated. When \\na new idea first emerges, it usually seems pretty feeble. It's a mere hatchling. Received wisdom \\nis a full-grown eagle by comparison. So it's easy to launch a devastating attack on a new idea, \\nand anyone who does will seem clever to those who don't understand this asymmetry.\\nThis phenomenon is exacerbated by the difference between how those working on new ideas \\nand those attacking them are rewarded. The rewards for working on new ideas are weighted by \\nthe value of the outcome. So it's worth working on something that only has a 10% chance of \\nsucceeding if it would make things more than 10x better. Whereas the rew\", \"rking on new ideas are weighted by \\nthe value of the outcome. So it's worth working on something that only has a 10% chance of \\nsucceeding if it would make things more than 10x better. Whereas the rewards for attacking \\nnew ideas are roughly constant; such attacks seem roughly equally clever regardless of the \\ntarget.\\nPeople will also attack new ideas when they have a vested interest in the old ones. It's not \\nsurprising, for example, that some of Darwin's harshest critics were churchmen. People build \\nwhole careers on some ideas. When someone claims they're false or obsolete, they feel \\nthreatened.\\nThe lowest form of dismissal is mere factionalism: to automatically dismiss any idea associated \\nwith the opposing faction. The lowest form of all is to dismiss an idea because of who proposed \\nit.\\nBut the main thing that leads reasonable people to dismiss new ideas is the same thing that \\nholds people back from proposing them: the sheer pervasiveness of the current paradigm.

And even they usually have to \\nsuppress their intuitions at first, like a pilot flying through cloud who has to trust his instruments \\nover his sense of balance. [4]\\nParadigms don't just define our present thinking. They also vacuum up the trail of crumbs that \\nled to them, making our standards for new ideas impossibly high. The current paradigm seems \\nso perfect to us, its offspring, that we imagine it must have been accepted completely as soon \\nas it was discovered — that whatever the church thought of the heliocentric model, astronomers \\nmust have been convinced as soon as Copernicus proposed it.

[5]\\nFew understand how feeble new ideas look when they first appear. So if you want to have new \\nideas yourself, one of the most valuable things you can do is to learn what they look like when \\nthey're born. Read about how new ideas happened, and try to get yourself into the heads of \\npeople at the time. How did things look to them, when the new idea was only half-finished, and \\neven the person who had it was only half-convinced it was right?\\nBut you don't have to stop at history.

Indeed, such crossovers tend to be particularly promising.\\n[2] I'm not claiming this principle extends much beyond math, engineering, and the hard sciences.

If we \\ncompare the 100 richest people in 1982 to the 100 richest in 2020, we notice some big \\ndifferences.\\nIn 1982 the most common source of wealth was inheritance. Of the 100 richest people, 60 \\ninherited from an ancestor. There were 10 du Pont heirs alone. By 2020 the number of heirs \\nhad been cut in half, accounting for only 27 of the biggest 100 fortunes.\\nWhy would the percentage of heirs decrease? Not because inheritance taxes increased. In fact, \\nthey decreased significantly during this period. The reason the percentage of heirs has \\ndecreased is not that fewer people are inheriting great fortunes, but that more people are \\nmaking them.\\nHow are people making these new fortunes?

Hedge funds and \\nprivate equity firms existed in 1982, but none of their founders were rich enough yet to make it \\ninto the top 100. Two things changed: fund managers discovered new ways to generate high \\nreturns, and more investors were willing to trust them with their money. [1]\\nBut the main source of new fortunes now is starting companies, and when you look at the data, \\nyou see big changes there too.

People get richer from starting companies now than they did in \\n1982, because the companies do different things.\\nIn 1982, there were two dominant sources of new wealth: oil and real estate. Of the 40 new \\nfortunes in 1982, at least 24 were due primarily to oil or real estate. Now only a small number \\nare: of the 73 new fortunes in 2020, 4 were due to real estate and only 2 to oil.\\nBy 2020 the biggest source of new wealth was what are sometimes called \"tech\" companies. Of \\nthe 73 new fortunes, about 30 derive from such companies. These are particularly common \\namong the richest of the rich: 8 of the top 10 fortunes in 2020 were new fortunes of this type.\\nArguably it\\'s slightly misleading to treat tech as a category. Isn\\'t Amazon really a retailer, and \\nTesla a car maker? Yes and no.

Yes and no. Maybe in 50 years, when what we call tech is taken for granted, \\nit won't seem right to put these two businesses in the same category. But at the moment at \\nleast, there is definitely something they share in common that distinguishes them. What retailer \\nstarts AWS? What car maker is run by someone who also has a rocket company?\\nThe tech companies behind the top 100 fortunes also form a well-differentiated group in the \\nsense that they're all companies that venture capitalists would readily invest in, and the others \\nmostly not. And there's a reason why: these are mostly companies that win by having better \\ntechnology, rather than just a CEO who's really driven and good at making deals.\\nTo that extent, the rise of the tech companies represents a qualitative change.

They won by \\nbeing really driven and good at making deals\", \"ch companies represents a qualitative change. The oil and real \\nestate magnates of the 1982 Forbes 400 didn't win by making better technology. They won by \\nbeing really driven and good at making deals. [2] And indeed, that way of getting rich is so old \\nthat it predates the Industrial Revolution. The courtiers who got rich in the (nominal) service of \\nEuropean royal houses in the 16th and 17th centuries were also, as a rule, really driven and \\ngood at making deals.\\nPeople who don't look any deeper than the Gini coefficient look back on the world of 1982 as \\nthe good old days, because those who got rich then didn't get as rich. But if you dig into how \\nthey got rich, the old days don't look so good. In 1982, 84% of the richest 100 people got rich by \\ninheritance, extracting natural resources, or doing real estate deals. Is that really better than a \\nworld in which the richest people get rich by starting tech companies?\\nWhy are people starting so many more new companies than they used to\", 's, or doing real estate deals. Is that really better than a \\nworld in which the richest people get rich by starting tech companies?\\nWhy are people starting so many more new companies than they used to, and why are they \\ngetting so rich from it? The answer to the first question, curiously enough, is that it\\'s \\nmisphrased. We shouldn\\'t be asking why people are starting companies, but why they\\'re \\nstarting companies again. [3]\\nIn 1892, the New York Herald Tribune compiled a list of all the millionaires in America. They \\nfound 4047 of them. How many had inherited their wealth then? Only about 20%, which is less \\nthan the proportion of heirs today. And when you investigate the sources of the new fortunes, \\n1892 looks even more like today. Hugh Rockoff found that \"many of the richest ... gained their \\ninitial edge from the new technology of mass production.\" [4]\\nSo it\\'s not 2020 that\\'s the anomaly here, but 1982. The real question is why so few people had \\ngotten rich from starting companies', 'their \\ninitial edge from the new technology of mass production.\" [4]\\nSo it\\'s not 2020 that\\'s the anomaly here, but 1982. The real question is why so few people had \\ngotten rich from starting companies in 1982. And the answer is that even as the Herald \\nTribune\\'s list was being compiled, a wave of consolidation was sweeping through the American \\neconomy. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, financiers like J. P\\n. Morgan combined \\nthousands of smaller companies into a few hundred giant ones with commanding economies of \\nscale. By the end of World War II, as Michael Lind writes, \"the major sectors of the economy \\nwere either organized as government-backed cartels or dominated by a few oligopolistic \\ncorporations.\" [5]\\nIn 1960, most of the people who start startups today would have gone to work for one of them. \\nYou could get rich from starting your own company in 1890 and in 2020, but in 1960 it was not \\nreally a viable option.

You couldn't break through the oligopolies to get at the markets. So the \\nprestigious route in 1960 was not to start your own company, but to work your way up the \\ncorporate ladder at an existing one. [6]\\nMaking everyone a corporate employee decreased economic inequality (and every other kind of \\nvariation), but if your model of normal is the mid 20th century, you have a very misleading \\nmodel in that respect. J. P\\n. Morgan's economy turned out to be just a phase, and starting in the \\n1970s, it began to break up.\\nWhy did it break up? Partly senescence. The big companies that seemed models of scale and \\nefficiency in 1930 had by 1970 become slack and bloated. By 1970 the rigid structure of the \\neconomy was full of cosy nests that various groups had built to insulate themselves from \\nmarket forces.

The \\nbest way to envision what happened is to imagine a pond with a crust of ice on top. Initially the \\nonly way from the bottom to the surface is around the edges. But as the ice crust weakens, you \\nstart to be able to punch right through the middle.\\nThe edges of the pond were pure tech: companies that actually described themselves as being \\nin the electronics or software business. When you used the word \"startup\" in 1990, that was \\nwhat you meant. But now startu', ' pond were pure tech: companies that actually described themselves as being \\nin the electronics or software business. When you used the word \"startup\" in 1990, that was \\nwhat you meant. But now startups are punching right through the middle of the ice crust and \\ndisplacing incumbents like retailers and TV networks and car companies. [7]\\nBut though the breakup of J. P\\n. Morgan\\'s economy created a new world in the technological \\nsense, it was a reversion to the norm in the social sense. If you only look back as far as the mid \\n20th century, it seems like people getting rich by starting their own companies is a recent \\nphenomenon. But if you look back further, you realize it\\'s actually the default. So what we \\nshould expect in the future is more of the same. Indeed, we should expect both the number and \\nwealth of founders to grow, because every decade it gets easier to start a startup.\\nPart of the reason it\\'s getting easier to start a startup is social. Society is (re)assimilating the \\nco', \"number and \\nwealth of founders to grow, because every decade it gets easier to start a startup.\\nPart of the reason it's getting easier to start a startup is social. Society is (re)assimilating the \\nconcept. If you start one now, your parents won't freak out the way they would have a \\ngeneration ago, and knowledge about how to do it is much more widespread. But the main \\nreason it's easier to start a startup now is that it's cheaper. Technology has driven down the \\ncost of both building products and acquiring customers.\\nThe decreasing cost of starting a startup has in turn changed the balance of power between \\nfounders and investors. Back when starting a startup meant building a factory, you needed \\ninvestors' permission to do it at all. But now investors need founders more than founders need \\ninvestors, and that, combined with the increasing amount of venture capital available, has \\ndriven up valuations. [8]\\nSo the decreasing cost of starting a startup increases the number of rich peop\", \"ed \\ninvestors, and that, combined with the increasing amount of venture capital available, has \\ndriven up valuations. [8]\\nSo the decreasing cost of starting a startup increases the number of rich people in two ways: it \\nmeans that more people start them, and that those who do can raise money on better terms.\\nBut there's also a third factor at work: the companies themselves are more valuable, because \\nnewly founded companies grow faster than they used to. Technology hasn't just made it \\ncheaper to build and distribute things, but faster too.\\nThis trend has been running for a long time. IBM, founded in 1896, took 45 years to reach a \\nbillion 2020 dollars in revenue. Hewlett-Packard, founded in 1939, took 25 years. Microsoft, \\nfounded in 1975, took 13 years. Now the norm for fast-growing companies is 7 or 8 years. [9]\\nFast growth has a double effect on the value of founders' stock. The value of a company is a \\nfunction of its revenue and its growth rate. So if a company grows faster, you \", \"anies is 7 or 8 years. [9]\\nFast growth has a double effect on the value of founders' stock. The value of a company is a \\nfunction of its revenue and its growth rate. So if a company grows faster, you not only get to a \\nbillion dollars in revenue sooner, but the company is more valuable when it reaches that point \\nthan it would be if it were growing slower.\\nThat's why founders sometimes get so rich so young now. The low initial cost of starting a \\nstartup means founders can start young, and the fast growth of companies today means that if \\nthey succeed they could be surprisingly rich just a few years later.\\nIt's easier now to start and grow a company than it has ever been. That means more people \\nstart them, that those who do get better terms from investors, and that the resulting companies \\nbecome more valuable.

If you haven't been involved with \\nnonprofits, you may never have heard this phrase before. But if you have been, it probably \\nmade you wince.\\nRestricted donations mean donations where the donor limits what can be done with the money. \\nThis is common with big donations, perhaps the default. And yet it's usually a bad idea. Usually \\nthe way the donor wants the money spent is not the way the nonprofit would have chosen. \\nOtherwise there would have been no need to restrict the donation.

It's either a donation to a bad \\nnonprofit, or a donation for the wrong things.\\nThere are a couple exceptions to this principle. One is when the nonprofit is an umbrella \\norganization. It's reasonable to make a restricted donation to a university, for example, because \\na university is only nominally a single nonprofit. Another exception is when the donor actually \\ndoes know as much as the nonprofit about where money needs to be spent. The Gates \\nFoundation, for example, has specific goals and often makes restricted donations to individual \\nnonprofits to accomplish them.

They often have other motives as \\nwell — to make a mark, or to generate good publicity [1], or to comply with regulations or \\ncorporate policies. Many donors may simply never have considered the distinction between \\nrestricted and unrestricted donations. They may believe that donating money for some specific \\npurpose is just how donation works. And to be fair, nonprofits don't try very hard to discourage \\nsuch illusions. They can't afford to.

The school \\ndistrict\\'s 1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and my friend Rich \\nDraves and I got permission to use it. It was like a mini Bond villain\\'s lair down there, with all \\nthese alien-looking machines ÿý CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader ÿý sitting up on a raised floor \\nunder bright fluorescent lights.\\nThe language we used was an early version of Fortran.

You had to type programs on punch \\ncards, then stack them in the card reader and press a button to load the program into memory \\nand run it. The result would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly loud printer.\\nI was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn't figure out what to do with it. And in retrospect there's not \\nmuch I could have done with it. The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched \\ncards, and I didn't have any data stored on punched cards. The only other option was to do \\nthings that didn't rely on any input, like calculate approximations of pi, but I didn't know enough \\nmath to do anything interesting of that type. So I'm not surprised I can't remember any \\nprograms I wrote, because they can't have done much. My clearest memory is of the moment I \\nlearned it was possible for programs not to terminate, when one of mine didn't.

Now you could have a computer sitting right in front \\nof you, on a desk, that could respond to your keystrokes as it was running instead of just \\nchurning through a stack of punch cards and then stopping. [1]\\nThe first of my friends to get a microcomputer built it himself. It was sold as a kit by Heathkit. I \\nremember vividly how impressed and envious I felt watching him sitting in front of it, typing \\nprograms right into the computer.\\nComputers were expensive in those days and it took me years of nagging before I convinced \\nmy father to buy one, a TRS-80, in about 1980. The gold standard then was the Apple II, but a \\nTRS-80 was good enough. This was when I really started programming.

In college I was going to study \\nphilosophy, which sounded much more powerful. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be \\nthe study of the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in other fields would be \\nmere domain knowledge.

All I knew at the time was that I kept taking \\nphilosophy courses and they kept being boring. So I decided to switch to AI.\\nAI was in the air in the mid 1980s, but there were two things especially that made me want to \\nwork on it: a novel by Heinlein called The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an \\nintelligent computer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry Winograd using \\nSHRDLU. I haven't tried rereading The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, so I don't know how well it \\nhas aged, but when I read it I was drawn entirely into its world.

It seemed only a matter of time \\nbefore we'd have Mike, and when I saw Winograd using SHRDLU, it seemed like that time \\nwould be a few years at most. All you had to do was teach SHRDLU more words.\\nThere weren't any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate classes, so I started trying to \\nteach myself. Which meant learning Lisp, since in those days Lisp was regarded as the \\nlanguage of AI. The commonly used programming languages then were pretty primitive, and \\nprogrammers' ideas correspondingly so. The default language at Cornell was a Pascal-like \\nlanguage called PL/I, and the situation was similar elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my \\nconcept of a program so fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where the \\nnew limits were. This was more like it; this was what I had expected college to do.

I knew what I was going to do.\\nFor my undergraduate thesis, I reverse-engineered SHRDLU. My God did I love working on that \\nprogram. It was a pleasing bit of code, but what made it even more exciting was my belief ÿý hard \\nto imagine now, but not unique in 1985 ÿý that it was already climbing the lower slopes of \\nintelligence.\\nI had gotten into a program at Cornell that didn\\'t make you choose a major. You could take \\nwhatever classes you liked, and choose whatever you liked to put on your degree. I of course \\nchose \"Artificial Intelligence.\" When I got the actual physical diploma, I was dismayed to find \\nthat the quotes had been included, which made them read as scare-quotes.

Only Harvard accepted me, so that \\nwas where I went.\\nI don\\'t remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a specific moment, but during \\nthe first year of grad school I realized that AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax. By which I \\nmean the sort of AI in which a program that\\'s told \"the dog is sitting on the chair\" translates this \\ninto some formal representation and adds it to the list of things it knows.\\nWhat these programs really showed was that there\\'s a subset of natural language that\\'s a \\nformal ', 'he chair\" translates this \\ninto some formal representation and adds it to the list of things it knows.\\nWhat these programs really showed was that there\\'s a subset of natural language that\\'s a \\nformal language. But a very proper subset. It was clear that there was an unbridgeable gap \\nbetween what they could do and actually understanding natural language. It was not, in fact, \\nsimply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words. That whole way of doing AI, with explicit data \\nstructures representing concepts, was not going to work. Its brokenness did, as so often \\nhappens, generate a lot of opportunities to write papers about various band-aids that could be \\napplied to it, but it was never going to get us Mike.\\nSo I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wreckage of my plans, and there was \\nLisp. I knew from experience that Lisp was interesting for its own sake and not just for its \\nassociation with AI, even though that was the main reason people cared about it at the time.

I didn't have a word of my dissertation \\nwritten, but in what must have been the quickest bit of thinking in my life, I decided to take a \\nshot at writing one in the 5 weeks or so that remained before the deadline, reusing parts of On \\nLisp wher\", 'ten, but in what must have been the quickest bit of thinking in my life, I decided to take a \\nshot at writing one in the 5 weeks or so that remained before the deadline, reusing parts of On \\nLisp where I could, and I was able to respond, with no perceptible delay \"Yes, I think so. I\\'ll give \\nyou something to read in a few days.\"\\nI picked applications of continuations as the topic. In retrospect I should have written about \\nmacros and embedded languages. There\\'s a whole world there that\\'s barely been explored. But \\nall I wanted was to get out of grad school, and my rapidly written dissertation sufficed, just \\nbarely.\\nMeanwhile I was applying to art schools. I applied to two: RISD in the US, and the Accademia \\ndi Belli Arti in Florence, which, because it was the oldest art school, I imagined would be good. \\nRISD accepted me, and I never heard back from the Accademia, so off to Providence I went.\\nI\\'d applied for the BFA program at RISD, which meant in effect that I had to go to college ag', \" would be good. \\nRISD accepted me, and I never heard back from the Accademia, so off to Providence I went.\\nI'd applied for the BFA program at RISD, which meant in effect that I had to go to college again. \\nThis was not as strange as it sounds, because I was only 25, and art schools are full of people \\nof different ages. RISD counted me as a transfer sophomore and said I had to do the foundation \\nthat summer. The foundation means the classes that everyone has to take in fundamental \\nsubjects like drawing, color, and design.\\nToward the end of the summer I got a big surprise: a letter from the Accademia, which had \\nbeen delayed because they'd sent it to Cambridge England instead of Cambridge \\nMassachusetts, inviting me to take the entrance exam in Florence that fall. This was now only \\nweeks away. My nice landlady let me leave my stuff in her attic. I had some money saved from \\nconsulting work I'd done in grad school; there was probably enough to last a year if I lived \\ncheaply. Now all I\", \"away.

Now all I had to do was learn Italian.\\nOnly stranieri (foreigners) had to take this entrance exam. In retrospect it may well have been a \\nway of excluding them, because there were so many stranieri attracted by the idea of studying \\nart in Florence that the Italian students would otherwise have been outnumbered. I was in \\ndecent shape at painting and drawing from the RISD foundation that summer, but I still don't \\nknow how I managed to pass the written exam. I remember that I answered the essay question \\nby writing about Cezanne, and that I cranked up the intellectual level as high as I could to make \\nthe most of my limited vocabulary.

[2]\\nI'm only up to age 25 and already there are such conspicuous patterns. Here I was, yet again \\nabout to attend some august institution in the hopes of learning about some prestigious subject, \\nand yet again about to be disappointed. The students and faculty in the painting department at \\nthe Accademia were the nicest people you could imagine, but they had long since arrived at an \\narrangement whereby the students wouldn't require the faculty to teach anything, and in return \\nthe faculty wouldn't require the students to learn anything. And at the same time all involved \\nwould adhere outwardly to the conventions of a 19th century atelier. We actually had one of \\nthose little stoves, fed with kindling, that you see in 19th century studio paintings, and a nude \\nmodel sitting as close to it as possible without getting burned.

She made a living from a \\ncombination of modelling and making fakes for a local antique dealer. She'd copy an obscure \\nold painting out of a book, and then he'd take the copy and maltreat it to make it look old. [3]\\nWhile I was a student at the Accademia I started painting still lives in my bedroom at night. \\nThese paintings were tiny, because the room was, and because I painted them on leftover \\nscraps of canvas, which was all I could afford at the time. Painting still lives is different from \\npainting people, because the subject, as its name suggests, can't move. People can't sit for \\nmore than about 15 minutes at a time, and when they do they don't sit very still. So the \\ntra\", \"ferent from \\npainting people, because the subject, as its name suggests, can't move.

So the \\ntraditional m.o. for painting people is to know how to paint a generic person, which you then \\nmodify to match the specific person you're painting. Whereas a still life you can, if you want, \\ncopy pixel by pixel from what you're seeing. You don't want to stop there, of course, or you get \\nmerely photographic accuracy, and what makes a still life interesting is that it's been through a \\nhead. You want to emphasize the visual cues that tell you, for example, that the reason the color \\nchanges suddenly at a certain point is that it's the edge of an object. By subtly emphasizing \\nsuch things you can make paintings that are more realistic than photographs not just in some \\nmetaphorical sense, but in the strict information-theoretic sense.

This is a feature of brains, not a bug. In everyday life it would be \\ndistracting to notice every leaf on every bush. But when you have to paint something, you have \\nto look more closely, and when you do there\\'s a lot to see.

I'm not 100% sure it's even a good way to paint. But it seemed \\na good enough bet to be worth trying.\\nOur teacher, professor Ulivi, was a nice guy. He could see I worked hard, and gave me a good \\ngrade, which he wrote down in a sort of passport each student had. But the Accademia wasn't \\nteaching me anything except Italian, and my money was running out, so at the end of the first \\nyear I went back to the US.\\nI wanted to go back to RISD, but I was now broke and RISD was very expensive, so I decided \\nto get a job for a year and then return to RISD the next fall.

Now they wanted a Lisp \\nhacker to write things in it. This was the closest thing I've had to a normal job, and I hereby \\napologize to my boss and coworkers, because I was a bad employee. Their Lisp was the \\nthinnest icing on a giant C cake, and since I didn't know C and didn't want to learn it, I never \\nunderstood most of the software. Plus I was terribly irresponsible.

Toward the end of the year I spent much of my time \\nsurreptitiously working on On Lisp, which I had by this time gotten a contract to publish.\\nThe good part was that I got paid huge amounts of money, especially by art student standards. \\nIn Florence, after paying my part of the rent, my budget for everything else had been $7 a day. \\nNow I was getting paid more than 4 times that every hour, even when I was just sitting in a \\nmeeting. By living cheaply I not only managed to save enough to go back to RISD, but also paid \\noff my college loans.\\nI learned some useful things at Interleaf, though they were mostly about what not to do.

Which in turn means that prest', 's good to be the \"entry level\" option, even though that \\nwill be less prestigious, because if you\\'re not, someone else will be, and will squash you against \\nthe ceiling.

When I came \\nback to visit for a project later on, someone told me about a new thing called HTML, which was, \\nas he described it, a derivative of SGML. Markup language enthusiasts were an occupational \\nhazard at Interleaf and I ignored him, but this HTML thing later became a big part of my life.\\nIn the fall of 1992 I moved back to Providence to continue at RISD.

Better \\norganized, certainly, and a lot more expensive, but it was now becoming clear that art school \\ndid not bear the same relationship to art that medical school bore to medicine. At least not the \\npainting department. The textile department, which my next door neighbor belonged to, seemed \\nto be pretty rigorous. No doubt illustration and architecture were too. But painting was post-\\nrigorous. Painting students were supposed to express themselves, which to the more worldly \\nones meant to try to cook up some sort of distinctive signature style.\\nA signature style is the visual equivalent of what in show business is known as a \"schtick\": \\nsomething that immediately identifies the work as yours and no one else\\'s. For example, when \\nyou see a painting that looks like a certain kind of cartoon, you know it\\'s by Roy Licht', ' as a \"schtick\": \\nsomething that immediately identifies the work as yours and no one else\\'s. For example, when \\nyou see a painting that looks like a certain kind of cartoon, you know it\\'s by Roy Lichtenstein. \\nSo if you see a big painting of this type hanging in the apartment of a hedge fund manager, you \\nknow he paid millions of dollars for it. That\\'s not always why artists have a signature style, but \\nit\\'s usually why buyers pay a lot for such work. [6]\\nThere were plenty of earnest students too: kids who \"could draw\" in high school, and now had \\ncome to what was supposed to be the best art school in the country, to learn to draw even \\nbetter. They tended to be confused and demoralized by what they found at RISD, but they kept \\ngoing, because painting was what they did.

So in 1993 I dropped out. I hung around Providence for a bit, \\nand then my college friend Nancy Parmet did me a big favor. A rent-controlled apartment in a \\nbuilding her mother owned in New York was becoming vacant. Did I want it? It wasn't much \\nmore than my current place, and New York was supposed to be where the artists were. So yes, \\nI wanted it! [7]\\nAsterix comics begin by zooming in on a tiny corner of Roman Gaul that turns out not to be \\ncontrolled by the Romans. You can do something similar on a map of New York City: if you \\nzoom in on the Upper East Side, there's a tiny corner that's not rich, or at least wasn't in 1993. \\nIt's called Yorkville, and that was my new home.

Now I was a New York artist ÿý in the strictly \\ntechnical sense of making paintings and living in New York.\\nI was nervous about money, because I could sense that Interleaf was on the way down. \\nFreelance Lisp hacking work was very rare, and I didn't want to have to program in another \\nlanguage, which in those days would have meant C++ if I was lucky. So with my unerring nose \\nfor financial opportunity, I decided to write another book on Lisp. This would be a popular book, \\nthe sort of book that could be used as a textbook. I imagined myself living frugally off the \\nroyalties and spending all my time painting. (The painting on the cover of this book, ANSI \\nCommon Lisp, is one that I painted around this time.)\\nThe best thing about New York for me was the presence of Idelle and Julian Weber.

Idelle \\nWeber was a painter, one of the early photorealists, and I'd taken her painting class at Harvard. \\nI've never known a teacher more beloved by her students. Large numbers of former students \\nkept in touch with her, including me. After I moved to New York I became her de facto studio \\nassistant.\\nShe liked to paint on big, square canvases, 4 to 5 feet on a side. One day in late 1994 as I was \\nstretching one of these monsters there was something on the radio about a famous fund \\nmanager. He wasn't that much older than me, and was super rich. The thought suddenly \\noccurred to me: why don't I become rich? Then I'll be able to work on whatever I want.\\nMeanwhile I'd been hearing more and more about this new thing called the World Wide Web. \\nRobert Morris showed it to me when I visited him in Cambridge, where he was now in grad \\n\", \" on whatever I want.\\nMeanwhile I'd been hearing more and more about this new thing called the World Wide Web. \\nRobert Morris showed it to me when I visited him in Cambridge, where he was now in grad \\nschool at Harvard.

It seemed like the web would do \\nthe same for the internet.\\nIf I wanted to get rich, here was the next train leaving the station. I was right about that part. \\nWhat I got wrong was the idea. I decided we should start a company to put art galleries online. I \\ncan't honestly say, after reading so many Y Combinator applications, that this was the worst \\nstartup idea ever, but it was up there. Art galleries didn't want to be online, and still don't, not \\nthe fancy ones. That's not how they sell.

Then we tried to sign up galleries. To call this a difficult sale would be an \\nunderstatement. It was difficult to give away. A few galleries let us make sites for them for free, \\nbut none paid us.\\nThen some online stores started to appear, and I realized that except for the order buttons they \\nwere identical to the sites we\\'d been generating for galleries. This impressive-sounding thing \\ncalled an \"internet storefront\" was something we already knew how to build.\\nSo in the summer of 1995, after I submitted the camera-ready copy of ANSI Common Lisp to \\nthe publishers, we started trying to write software to build online stores. At first this was going to \\nbe normal desktop software, which in those days meant Windows software.

But we decided we'd at least try writing a prototype store \\nbuilder on Unix. Robert wrote a shopping cart, and I wrote a new site generator for stores ÿý in \\nLisp, of course.\\nWe were working out of Robert's apartment in Cambridge. His roommate was away for big \\nchunks of time, during which I got to sleep in his room. For some reason there was no bed \\nframe or sheets, just a mattress on the floor. One morning as I was lying on this mattress I had \\nan idea that made me sit up like a capital L. What if we ran the software on the server, and let \\nusers control it by clicking on links? Then we'd never have to write anything to run on users' \\ncomputers. We could generate the sites on the same server we'd serve them from.

Users \\nwouldn't need anything more than a browser.\\nThis kind of software, known as a web app, is common now, but at the time it wasn't clear that it \\nwas even possible. To find out, we decided to try making a version of our store builder that you \\ncould control through the browser. A couple days later, on August 12, we had one that worked. \\nThe UI was horrible, but it proved you could build a whole store through the browser, without \\nany client software or typing anything into the command line on the server.\\nNow we felt like we were really onto something. I had visions of a whole new generation of \\nsoftware working this way. You wouldn't need versions, or ports, or any of that crap.

Now you could just update the software right on the \\nserver.\\nWe started a new company we called Viaweb, after the fact that our software worked via the \\nweb, and we got $10,000 in seed funding from Idelle's husband Julian. In return for that and \\ndoing the initial legal work and giving us business advice, we gave him 10% of the company. \\nTen years later this deal became the model for Y Combinator's. We knew founders needed \\nsomething like this, because we'd needed it ourselves.\\nAt this stage I had a negative net worth, because the thousand dollars or so I had in the bank \\nwas more than counterbalanced by what I owed the government in taxes.

So \\nalthough Robert had his graduate student stipend, I needed that seed funding to live on.\\nWe originally hoped to launch in September, but we got more ambitious about the software as \\nwe worked on it. Eventually we managed to build a WYSIWYG site builder, in the sense that as \\nyou were creating pages, they looked exactly like the static ones that would be generated later, \\nexcept that instead of leading to static pages, the links all referred to closures stored in a hash \\ntable on the server.\\nIt helped to have studied art, because the main goal of an online store builder is to make users \\nlook legit, and the key to looking legit is high production values.

It may look clunky today, but in 1996 it was the last word in slick.)\\nIn September, Robert rebelled. \"We\\'ve been working on this for a month,\" he said, \"and it\\'s still \\nnot done.\" This is funny in retrospect, because he would still be working on it almost 3 years \\nlater. But I decided it might be prudent to recruit more programmers, and I asked Robert who \\nelse in grad school with him was really good. He recommended Trevor Blackwell, which \\nsurprised me at first, because at that point I knew Trevor mainly for his plan to reduce \\neverything in his life to a stack of notecards, which he carried around with him.

If you could see inside Rtm's brain it would look \\nlike a colonial New England church, and if you could see inside Trevor's it would look like the \\nworst excesses of Austrian Rococo.\\nWe opened for business, with 6 stores, in January 1996. It was just as well we waited a few \\nmonths, because although we worried we were late, we were actually almost fatally early. There \\nwas a lot of talk in the press then about ecommerce, but not many people actually wanted \\nonline stores.

I kept the code tight and didn't have to integrate with any other software \\nexcept Robert's and Trevor's, so it was quite fun to work on.

We had no \\nidea what businesses paid for things. $300 a month seemed like a lot of money to us.\\nWe did a lot of things right by accident like that. For example, we did what\\'s now called \"doing \\nthings that don\\'t scale,\" although at the time we would have described it as \"being so lame that \\nwe\\'re driven to the most desperate measures to get users.\" The most common of which was \\nbuilding stores for them.

This seemed particularly humiliating, since the whole raison d\\'etre of \\nour software was that people could use it to make their own stores. But anything to get users.\\nWe learned a lot more about retail than we wanted to know. For example, that if you could only \\nhave a small image of a man\\'s shirt (and all images were small then by present standards), it \\nwas better to have a closeup of the collar than a picture of the whole shirt. The reason I \\nremember learning this was that it meant I had to rescan about 30 images of men\\'s shirts. My \\nfirst set of scans were so beautiful too.\\nThough this felt wrong, it was exactly the right thing to be doing.

Whatever users wanted, I was all theirs. Maybe one day we\\'d have \\nso many users that I couldn\\'t scan their images for them, but in the meantime there was nothing \\nmore important to do.\\nAnother thing I didn\\'t get at the time is that growth rate is the ultimate test of a startup. Our \\ngrowth rate was fine. We had about 70 stores at the end of 1996 and about 500 at the end of \\n1997. I mistakenly thought the thing that mattered was the absolute number of users. And that \\nis the thing that matters in the sense that that\\'s how much money you\\'re making, and if you\\'re \\nnot making enough, you might go out of business.

A company with just a handful of employees \\nwould have seemed amateurish. So we didn't reach breakeven until about when Yahoo bought \\nus in the summer of 1998.

I didn't realize it at the time, but I was worn out from the effort and stress \\nof running Viaweb. For a while after I got to California I tried to continue my usual m.o. of \\nprogramming till 3 in the morning, but fatigue combined with Yahoo's prematurely aged culture \\nand grim cube farm in Santa Clara gradually dragged me down. After a few months it felt \\ndisconcertingly like working at Interleaf.\\nYahoo had given us a lot of options when they bought us. At the time I thought Yahoo was so \\novervalued that they'd never be worth anything, but to my astonishment the stock went up 5x in \\nthe next year. I hung on till the first chunk of options vested, then in the summer of 1999 I left. It \\nhad been so long since I'd painted anything that I'd half forgotten why I was doing this.

It \\nhad been so long since I'd painted anything that I'd half forgotten why I was doing this. My brain \\nhad been entirely full of software and men's shirts for 4 years. But I had done this to get rich so \\nI could paint, I reminded myself, and now I was rich, so I should go paint.\\nWhen I said I was leaving, my boss at Yahoo had a long conversation with me about my plans. I \\ntold him all about the kinds of pictures I wanted to paint. At the time I was touched that he took \\nsuch an interest in me. Now I realize it was because he thought I was lying. My options at that \\npoint were worth about $2 million a month. If I was leaving that kind of money on the table, it \\ncould only be to go and start some new startup, and if I did, I might take people with me.

My boss was at that \\nmoment a billionaire.

There was no time to lose. I'd \\nalready burned 4 years getting rich. Now when I talk to founders who are leaving after selling \\ntheir companies, my advice is always the same: take a vacation. That's what I should have \\ndone, just gone off somewhere and done nothing for a month or two, but the idea never \\noccurred to me.\\nSo I tried to paint, but I just didn't seem to have any energy or ambition. Part of the problem was \\nthat I didn't know many people in California. I'd compounded this problem by buying a house up \\nin the Santa Cruz Mountains, with a beautiful view but miles from anywhere.

Idelle was in New York at least, and there were other people trying to paint there, \\neven though I didn't know any of them.\\nWhen I got back to New York I resumed my old life, except now I was rich. It was as weird as it \\nsounds. I resumed all my old patterns, except now there were doors where there hadn't been. \\nNow when I was tired of walking, all I had to do was raise my hand, and (unless it was raining) \\na taxi would stop to pick me up.

Now I could actually choose what neighborhood to \\nlive in. Where, I asked myself and various real estate agents, is the Cambridge of New York? \\nAided by occasional visits to actual Cambridge, I gradually realized there wasn't one. Huh.\\nAround this time, in the spring of 2000, I had an idea. It was clear from our experience with \\nViaweb that web apps were the future. Why not build a web app for making web apps?

It seemed obvious that \\nthis was the future. I didn't particularly want to start another company, but it was clear that this \\nidea would have to be embodied as one, so I decided to move to Cambridge and start it. I \\nhoped to lure Robert into working on it with me, but there I ran into a hitch. Robert was now a \\npostdoc at MIT, and though he'd made a lot of money the last time I'd lured him into working on \\none of my schemes, it had also been a huge time sink. So while he agreed that it sounded like \\na plausible idea, he firmly refused to work on it.\\nHmph.

So while he agreed that it sounded like \\na plausible idea, he firmly refused to work on it.\\nHmph. Well, I\\'d do it myself then. I recruited Dan Giffin, who had worked for Viaweb, and two \\nundergrads who wanted summer jobs, and we got to work trying to build what it\\'s now clear is \\nabout twenty companies and several open source projects worth of software. The language for \\ndefining applications would of course be a dialect of Lisp. But I wasn\\'t so naive as to assume I \\ncould spring an overt Lisp on a general audience; we\\'d hide the parentheses, like Dylan did.\\nBy then there was a name for the kind of company Viaweb was, an \"application service \\nprovider,\" or ASP\\n. This name didn\\'t last long before it was replaced by \"software as a service,\" \\nbut it was current for long enough that I named this new company after it: it was going to be \\ncalled Aspra.\\nI started working on the application builder, Dan worked on ne', 'by \"software as a service,\" \\nbut it was current for long enough that I named this new company after it: it was going to be \\ncalled Aspra.\\nI started working on the application builder, Dan worked on network infrastructure, and the two \\nundergrads worked on the first two services (images and phone calls). But about halfway \\nthrough the summer I realized I really didn\\'t want to run a company ÿý especially not a big one, \\nwhich it was looking like this would have to be. I\\'d only started Viaweb because I needed the \\nmoney. Now that I didn\\'t need money anymore, why was I doing this? If this vision had to be \\nrealized as a company, then screw the vision. I\\'d build a subset that could be done as an open \\nsource project.\\nMuch to my surprise, the time I spent working on this stuff was not wasted after all. After we \\nstarted Y Combinator, I would often encounter startups working on parts of this new \\narchitecture, and it was very useful to have spent so much time thinking about it and even trying', \"er all.

A lot of Lisp hackers dream of building a new Lisp, partly \\nbecause one of the distinctive features of the language is that it has dialects, and partly, I think, \\nbecause we have in our minds a Platonic form of Lisp that all existing dialects fall short of. I \\ncertainly did. So at the end of the summer Dan and I switched to working on this new dialect of \\nLisp, which I called Arc, in a house I bought in Cambridge.\\nThe following spring, lightning struck.

If I write something and put it on the web, anyone can read \\nit. That may seem obvious now, but it was surprising then. In the print era there was a narrow \\nchannel to readers, guarded by fierce monsters known as editors. The only way to get an \\naudience for anything you wrote was to get it published as a book, or in a newspaper or \\nmagazine. Now anyone could publish anything.\\nThis had been possible in principle since 1993, but not many people had realized it yet.

Even then it took me several years to \\nunderstand the implications. It meant there would be a whole new generation of essays. [11]\\nIn the print era, the channel for publishing essays had been vanishingly small. Except for a few \\nofficially anointed thinkers who went to the right parties in New York, the only people allowed to \\npublish essays were specialists writing about their specialties. There were so many essays that \\nhad never been written, because there had been no way to publish them. Now they could be, \\nand I was going to write them.

But when you find yourself drawn to \\nsome kind of work despite its current lack of prestige, it's a sign both that there's something real \\nto be discovered there, and that you have the right kind of motives. Impure motives are a big \\ndanger for the ambitious. If anything is going to lead you astray, it will be the desire to impress \\npeople. So while working on things that aren't prestigious doesn't guarantee you're on the right \\ntrack, it at least guarantees you're not on the most common type of wrong one.\\nOver the next several years I wrote lots of essays about all kinds of different topics.

And I bought another \\nbuilding in Cambridge, a former candy factory (and later, twas said, porn studio), to use as an \\noffice.\\nOne night in October 2003 there was a big party at my house. It was a clever idea of my friend \\nMaria Daniels, who was one of the thursday diners. Three separate hosts would all invite their \\nfriends to one party.

A couple days later I asked her out.\\nJessica was in charge of marketing at a Boston investment bank. This bank thought it \\nunderstood startups, but over the next year, as she met friends of mine from the startup world, \\nshe was surprised how different reality was. And how colorful their stories were. So she decided \\nto compile a book of interviews with startup founders.\\nWhen the bank had financial problems and she had to fire half her staff, she started looking for \\na new job. In early 2005 she interviewed for a marketing job at a Boston VC firm.

The prospect of having to \\nstand up in front of a group of people and tell them something that won't waste their time is a \\ngreat spur to the imagination. When the Harvard Computer Society, the undergrad computer \\nclub, asked me to give a talk, I decided I would tell them how to start a startup. Maybe they'd be \\nable to avoid the worst of the mistakes we'd made.\\nSo I gave this talk, in the course of which I told them that the best sources of seed funding were \\nsuccessful startup founders, because then they'd be sources of advice too.

Horrified at the prospect of having my inbox \\nflooded by business plans (if I\\'d only known), I blurted out \"But not me!\" and went on with the \\ntalk. But afterward it occurred to me that I should really stop procrastinating about angel \\ninvesting. I\\'d been meaning to since Yahoo bought us, and now it was 7 years later and I still \\nhadn\\'t done one angel investment.\\nMeanwhile I had been scheming with Robert and Trevor about projects we could work on \\ntogether.

We had no idea how to be angel investors, and in \\nBoston in 2005 there were no Ron Conways to learn from. So we just made what seemed like \\nthe obvious choices, and some of the things we did turned out to be novel.\\nThere are multiple components to Y Combinator, and we didn't figure them all out at once.

And neither of them helped founders enough in the beginning. \\nWe knew how helpless founders were in some respects, because we remembered how \\nhelpless we'd been. For example, one thing Julian had done for us that seemed to us like magic \\nwas to get us set up as a company. We were fine writing fairly difficult software, but actually \\ngetting incorporated, with bylaws and stock and all that stuff, how on earth did you do that?

We didn\\'t know how VC firms were organized. It never occurred to us to try to raise a fund, \\nand if it had, we wouldn\\'t have known where to start. [14]\\nThe most distinctive thing about YC is the batch model: to fund a bunch of startups all at once, \\ntwice a year, and then to spend three months focusing intensively on trying to help them. That \\npart we discovered by accident, not merely implicitly but explicitly due to our ignorance about \\ninvesting. We needed to get experience as investors.

That had to be fair, \\nbecause it was twice as good as the deal we ourselves had taken. Plus that first summer, which \\nwas really hot, Jessica brought the founders free air conditioners. [16]\\nFairly quickly I realized that we had stumbled upon the way to scale startup funding. Funding \\nstartups in batches was more convenient for us, because it meant we could do things for a lot of \\nstartups at once, but being part of a batch was better for the startups too. It solved one of the \\nbiggest problems faced by founders: the isolation. Now you not only had colleagues, but \\ncolleagues who understood the problems you were facing and could tell you how they were \\nsolving them.\\nAs YC grew, we started to notice other advantages of scale. The alumni became a tight \\ncommunity, dedicated to helping one another, and especially the current batch, whose shoes \\nthey remembered being in. We also noticed that the startups were becoming one another\\'s \\ncustomers. We used to refer jokingly to the \"YC GDP\\n', 'ne another, and especially the current batch, whose shoes \\nthey remembered being in.

Now lots of startups get their initial set of customers almost entirely from among \\ntheir batchmates.\\nI had not originally intended YC to be a full-time job. I was going to do three things: hack, write \\nessays, and work on YC. As YC grew, and I grew more excited about it, it started to take up a \\nlot more than a third of my attention. But for the first few years I was still able to work on other \\nthings.\\nIn the summer of 2006, Robert and I started working on a new version of Arc. This one was \\nreasonably fast, because it was compiled into Scheme. To test this new Arc, I wrote Hacker \\nNews in it. It was originally meant to be a news aggregator for startup founders and was called \\nStartup News, but after a few months I got tired of re', \"to Scheme. To test this new Arc, I wrote Hacker \\nNews in it. It was originally meant to be a news aggregator for startup founders and was called \\nStartup News, but after a few months I got tired of reading about nothing but startups. Plus it \\nwasn't startup founders we wanted to reach. It was future startup founders. So I changed the \\nname to Hacker News and the topic to whatever engaged one's intellectual curiosity.\\nHN was no doubt good for YC, but it was also by far the biggest source of stress for me. If all I'd \\nhad to do was select and help founders, life would have been so easy. And that implies that HN \\nwas a mistake. Surely the biggest source of stress in one's work should at least be something \\nclose to the core of the work. Whereas I was like someone who was in pain while running a \\nmarathon not from the exertion of running, but because I had a blister from an ill-fitting shoe. \\nWhen I was dealing with some urgent problem during YC, there was about a 60% chance it had \\nto do \", \" a \\nmarathon not from the exertion of running, but because I had a blister from an ill-fitting shoe. \\nWhen I was dealing with some urgent problem during YC, there was about a 60% chance it had \\nto do with HN, and a 40% chance it had do with everything else combined. [17]\\nAs well as HN, I wrote all of YC's internal software in Arc. But while I continued to work a good \\ndeal in Arc, I gradually stopped working on Arc, partly because I didn't have time to, and partly \\nbecause it was a lot less attractive to mess around with the language now that we had all this \\ninfrastructure depending on it. So now my three projects were reduced to two: writing essays \\nand working on YC.\\nYC was different from other kinds of work I've done.

I even \\nwrote a couple that weren't about startups. Then in March 2015 I started working on Lisp again.\\nThe distinctive thing about Lisp is that its core is a language defined by writing an interpreter in \\nitself. It wasn't originally intended as a programming language in the ordinary sense. It was \\nmeant to be a formal model of computation, an alternative to the Turing machine. If you want to \\nwrite an interpreter for a language in itself, what's the minimum set of predefined operators you \\nneed? The Lisp that John McCarthy invented, or more accurately discovered, is an answer to \\nthat question. [19]\\nMcCarthy didn't realize this Lisp could even be used to program computers till his grad student \\nSteve Russell suggested it. Russell trans\", \"e accurately discovered, is an answer to \\nthat question. [19]\\nMcCarthy didn't realize this Lisp could even be used to program computers till his grad student \\nSteve Russell suggested it. Russell translated McCarthy's interpreter into IBM 704 machine \\nlanguage, and from that point Lisp started also to be a programming language in the ordinary \\nsense. But its origins as a model of computation gave it a power and elegance that other \\nlanguages couldn't match. It was this that attracted me in college, though I didn't understand \\nwhy at the time.\\nMcCarthy's 1960 Lisp did nothing more than interpret Lisp expressions. It was missing a lot of \\nthings you'd want in a programming language. So these had to be added, and when they were, \\nthey weren't defined using McCarthy's original axiomatic approach. That wouldn't have been \\nfeasible at the time. McCarthy tested his interpreter by hand-simulating the execution of \\nprograms. But it was already getting close to the limit of interpreters you could\", \"h. That wouldn't have been \\nfeasible at the time. McCarthy tested his interpreter by hand-simulating the execution of \\nprograms. But it was already getting close to the limit of interpreters you could test that way ÿý \\nindeed, there was a bug in it that McCarthy had overlooked. To test a more complicated \\ninterpreter, you'd have had to run it, and computers then weren't powerful enough.\\nNow they are, though. Now you could continue using McCarthy's axiomatic approach till you'd \\ndefined a complete programming language. And as long as every change you made to \\nMcCarthy's Lisp was a discoveredness-preserving transformation, you could, in principle, end \\nup with a complete language that had this quality. Harder to do than to talk about, of course, but \\nif it was possible in principle, why not try? So I decided to take a shot at it. It took 4 years, from \\nMarch 26, 2015 to October 12, 2019.

That may sound like a contradiction, but it's an \\nindication of the sort of trickery I had to engage in to make this work. By means of an egregious \\ncollection of hacks I managed to make something close enough to an interpreter written in itself \\nthat could actually run.

In \\nlate 2015 I spent 3 months writing essays, and when I went back to working on Bel I could \\nbarely understand the code.

The highest compliment we can pay to founders is to describe them as \"earnest.\" This \\nis not by itself a guarantee of success. You could be earnest but incapable. But when founders \\nare both formidable (another of our words) and earnest, they\\'re as close to unstoppable as you \\nget.\\nEarnestness sounds like a boring, even Victorian virtue. It seems a bit of an anachronism that \\npeople in Silicon Valley would care about it. Why does this matter so much?\\nWhen you call someone earnest, you\\'re making a statement about their motives.

It means both \\nthat they\\'re doing something for the right reasons, and that they\\'re trying as hard as they can. If \\nwe imagine motives as vectors, it means both the direction and the magnitude are right. Though \\nthese are of course related: when people are doing something for the right reasons, they try \\nharder. [1]\\nThe reason motives matter so much in Silicon Valley is that so many people there have the \\nwrong ones. Starting a successful startup makes you rich and famous. So a lot of the people \\ntrying to start them are doing it for those reasons. Instead of what? Instead of interest in the \\nproblem for its own sake. That is the root of earnestness. [2]\\nIt\\'s also the hallmark of a nerd.

It probably doesn't matter much \\nin politics, or in crime, or in certain types of business that are similar to crime, like gambling, \\npersonal injury law, patent trolling, and so on. Nor does it matter in academic fields at the more \\nbogus end of the spectrum.

So that could be a useful heuristic for \\ndeciding which fields to work in: how much does earnestness matter? Which can in turn \\npresumably be inferred from the prevalence of nerds at the top.\\nAlong with \"nerd,\" another word that tends to be associated with earnestness is \"naive.\" The \\nearnest often seem naive. It\\'s not just that they don\\'t have the motives other people have. They \\noften don\\'t fully grasp that such motives exist.

I'll tell you what they do look for, by explaining how to convince Y \\nCombinator to fund you, and you can see for yourself.\\nWhat YC looks for, above all, is founders who understand some group of users and can make \\nwhat they want. This is so important that it's YC's motto\", 'mbinator to fund you, and you can see for yourself.\\nWhat YC looks for, above all, is founders who understand some group of users and can make \\nwhat they want. This is so important that it\\'s YC\\'s motto: \"Make something people want.\"\\nA big company can to some extent force unsuitable products on unwilling customers, but a \\nstartup doesn\\'t have the power to do that. A startup must sing for its supper, by making things \\nthat genuinely delight its customers. Otherwise it will never get off the ground.\\nHere\\'s where things get difficult, both for you as a founder and for the YC partners trying to \\ndecide whether to fund you. In a market economy, it\\'s hard to make something people want that \\nthey don\\'t already have. That\\'s the great thing about market economies. If other people both \\nknew about this need and were able to satisfy it, they already would be, and there would be no \\nroom for your startup.\\nWhich means the conversation during your YC interview will have to be about something new: \\neit', 's need and were able to satisfy it, they already would be, and there would be no \\nroom for your startup.\\nWhich means the conversation during your YC interview will have to be about something new: \\neither a new need, or a new way to satisfy one. And not just new, but uncertain. If it were certain \\nthat the need existed and that you could satisfy it, that certainty would be reflected in large and \\nrapidly growing revenues, and you wouldn\\'t be seeking seed funding.\\nSo the YC partners have to guess both whether you\\'ve discovered a real need, and whether \\nyou\\'ll be able to satisfy it. That\\'s what they are, at least in this part of their job: professional \\nguessers. They have 1001 heuristics for doing this, and I\\'m not going to tell you all of them, but \\nI\\'m happy to tell you the most important ones, because these can\\'t be faked; the only way to \\n\"hack\" them would be to do what you should be doing anyway as a founder.\\nThe first thing the partners will try to figure out, usually, is whether w', 'ones, because these can\\'t be faked; the only way to \\n\"hack\" them would be to do what you should be doing anyway as a founder.\\nThe first thing the partners will try to figure out, usually, is whether what you\\'re making will ever \\nbe something a lot of people want. It doesn\\'t have to be something a lot of people want now. \\nThe product and the market will both evolve, and will influence each other\\'s evolution. But in the \\nend there has to be something with a huge market. That\\'s what the partners will be trying to \\nfigure out: is there a path to a huge market? [1]\\nSometimes it\\'s obvious there will be a huge market. If Boom manages to ship an airliner at all, \\ninternational airlines will have to buy it. But usually it\\'s not obvious. Usually the path to a huge \\nmarket is by growing a small market. This idea is important enough that it\\'s worth coining a \\nphrase for, so let\\'s call one of these small but growable markets a \"larval market.\"\\nThe perfect example of a larval market might be Apple\\'s', 't. This idea is important enough that it\\'s worth coining a \\nphrase for, so let\\'s call one of these small but growable markets a \"larval market.\"\\nThe perfect example of a larval market might be Apple\\'s market when they were founded in \\n1976. In 1976, not many people wanted their own computer. But more and more started to want \\none, till now every 10 year old on the planet wants a computer (but calls it a \"phone\").\\nThe ideal combination is the group of founders who are \"living in the future\" in the sense of \\nbeing at the leading edge of some kind of change, and who are building something they \\nthemselves want. Most super-successful startups are of this type. Steve Wozniak wanted a \\ncomputer. Mark Zuckerberg wanted to engage online with his college friends. Larry and Sergey \\nwanted to find things on the web. All these founders were building things they and their peers \\nwanted, and the fact that they were at the leading edge of change meant that more people \\nwould want these things in the ', \"ings on the web. All these founders were building things they and their peers \\nwanted, and the fact that they were at the leading edge of change meant that more people \\nwould want these things in the future.\\nBut although the ideal larval market is oneself and one's peers, that's not the only kind. A larval \\nmarket might also be regional, for example. You build something to serve one location, and then \\nexpand to others.\\nThe crucial feature of the initial market is that it exist. That may seem like an obvious point, but \\nthe lack of it is the biggest flaw in most startup ideas. There have to be some people who want \\nwhat you're building right now, and want it so urgently that they're willing to use it, bugs and all, \\neven though you're a small company they've never heard of. There don't have to be many, but \\nthere have to be some. As long as you have some users, there are straightforward ways to get \\nmore: build new features they want, seek out more people like them, get them to refer y\", 'e to be many, but \\nthere have to be some. As long as you have some users, there are straightforward ways to get \\nmore: build new features they want, seek out more people like them, get them to refer you to \\ntheir friends, and so on. But these techniques all require some initial seed group of users.\\nSo this is one thing the YC partners will almost certainly dig into during your interview. Who are \\nyour first users going to be, and how do you know they want this? If I had to decide whether to \\nfund startups based on a single question, it would be \"How do you know people want this?\"\\nThe most convincing answer is \"Because we and our friends want it.\" It\\'s even better when this \\nis followed by the news that you\\'ve already built a prototype, and even though it\\'s very crude, \\nyour friends are using it, and it\\'s spreading by word of mouth. If you can say that and you\\'re not \\nlying, the partners will switch from default no to default yes. Meaning you\\'re in unless there\\'s \\nsome other disqualifyi', \"ng it, and it's spreading by word of mouth. If you can say that and you're not \\nlying, the partners will switch from default no to default yes. Meaning you're in unless there's \\nsome other disqualifying flaw.\\nThat is a hard standard to meet, though. Airbnb didn't meet it. They had the first part. They had \\nmade something they themselves wanted. But it wasn't spreading. So don't feel bad if you don't \\nhit this gold standard of convincingness. If Airbnb didn't hit it, it must be too high.\\nIn practice, the YC partners will be satisfied if they feel that you have a deep understanding of \\nyour users' needs. And the Airbnbs did have that. They were able to tell us all about what \\nmotivated hosts and guests. They knew from first-hand experience, because they'd been the \\nfirst hosts. We couldn't ask them a question they didn't know the answer to. We ourselves were \\nnot very excited about the idea as users, but we knew this didn't prove anything, because there \\nwere lots of successful startups \", 'sk them a question they didn\\'t know the answer to. We ourselves were \\nnot very excited about the idea as users, but we knew this didn\\'t prove anything, because there \\nwere lots of successful startups we hadn\\'t been excited about as users. We were able to say to \\nourselves \"They seem to know what they\\'re talking about. Maybe they\\'re onto something. It\\'s \\nnot growing yet, but maybe they can figure out how to make it grow during YC.\" Which they did, \\nabout three weeks into the batch.\\nThe best thing you can do in a YC interview is to teach the partners about your users. So if you \\nwant to prepare for your interview, one of the best ways to do it is to go talk to your users and \\nfind out exactly what they\\'re thinking. Which is what you should be doing anyway.\\nThis may sound strangely credulous, but the YC partners want to rely on the founders to tell \\nthem about the market. Think about how VCs typically judge the potential market for an idea. \\nThey\\'re not ordinarily domain experts themselve', \" but the YC partners want to rely on the founders to tell \\nthem about the market. Think about how VCs typically judge the potential market for an idea. \\nThey're not ordinarily domain experts themselves, so they forward the idea to someone who is, \\nand ask for their opinion. YC doesn't have time to do this, but if the YC partners can convince \\nthemselves that the founders both (a) know what they're talking about and (b) aren't lying, they \\ndon't need outside domain experts. They can use the founders themselves as domain experts \\nwhen evaluating their own idea.\\nThis is why YC interviews aren't pitches. To give as many founders as possible a chance to get \\nfunded, we made interviews as short as we could: 10 minutes. That is not enough time for the \\npartners to figure out, through the indirect evidence in a pitch, whether you know what you're \\ntalking about and aren't lying. They need to dig in and ask you questions. There's not enough \\ntime for sequential access. They need random access. \", \" evidence in a pitch, whether you know what you're \\ntalking about and aren't lying. They need to dig in and ask you questions. There's not enough \\ntime for sequential access. They need random access. [2]\\nThe worst advice I ever heard about how to succeed in a YC interview is that you should take \\ncontrol of the interview and make sure to deliver the message you want to. In other words, turn \\nthe interview into a pitch. 'èelaborate expletive'é. It is so annoying when people try to do that. You \\nask them a question, and instead of answering it, they deliver some obviously prefabricated \\nblob of pitch. It eats up 10 minutes really fast.\\nThere is no one who can give you accurate advice about what to do in a YC interview except a \\ncurrent or former YC partner. People who've merely been interviewed, even successfully, have \\nno idea of this, but interviews take all sorts of different forms depending on what the partners \\nwant to know about most.

Founders sometimes walk \\naway from interviews complaining that they didn't get to explain their idea completely. True, but \\nthey explained enough.\\nSince a YC interview consists of questions, the way to do it well is to answer them well. Part of \\nthat is answering them candidly. The partners don't expect you to know everything. But if you \\ndon't know the answer to a question, don't try to bullshit your way out of it. The partners, like \\nmost experienced investors, are professional bullshit detectors, and you are (hopefully) an \\namateur bullshitter.

If you don\\'t know the answer to a \\nquestion, say you don\\'t, and tell them how you\\'d go about finding it, or tell them the answer to \\nsome related question.\\nIf you\\'re asked, for example, what could go wrong, the worst possible answer is \"nothing.\" \\nInstead of convincing them that your idea is bullet-proof, this will convince them that you\\'re a \\nfool or a liar. Far better to go into gruesome detail. That\\'s what experts do when you ask what \\ncould go wrong. The partners know that your idea is risky. That\\'s what a good bet looks like at \\nthis stage: a tiny probability of a huge outcome.\\nDitto if they ask about competitors. Competitors are rarely what kills startups. Poor execution \\ndoes.

Poor execution \\ndoes. But you should know who your competitors are, and tell the YC partners candidly what \\nyour relative strengths and weaknesses are. Because the YC partners know that competitors \\ndon't kill startups, they won't hold competitors against you too much. They will, however, hold it \\nagainst you if you seem either to be unaware of competitors, or to be minimizing the threat they \\npose. They may not be sure whether you're clueless or lying, but they don't need to be.\\nThe partners don't expect your idea to be perfect. This is seed investing. At this stage, all they \\ncan expect are promising hypotheses. But they do expect you to be thoughtful and honest. So if \\ntrying to make your idea seem perfect causes you to come off as glib or clueless, you've \\nsacrificed something you needed for something you didn't.\\nIf the partners are sufficiently convinced that there's a path to a big market, the next question is \\nwhether you'll be ab\", \"r clueless, you've \\nsacrificed something you needed for something you didn't.\\nIf the partners are sufficiently convinced that there's a path to a big market, the next question is \\nwhether you'll be able to find it. That in turn depends on three things: the general qualities of the \\nfounders, their specific expertise in this domain, and the relationship between them. How \\ndetermined are the founders? Are they good at building things? Are they resilient enough to \\nkeep going when things go wrong? How strong is their friendship?\\nThough the Airbnbs only did ok in the idea department, they did spectacularly well in this \\ndepartment. The story of how they'd funded themselves by making Obama- and McCain-\\nthemed breakfast cereal was the single most important factor in our decision to fund them. They \\ndidn't realize it at the time, but what seemed to them an irrelevant story was in fact fabulously \\ngood evidence of their qualities as founders.

They weren't doing this just for the money, or because startups were cool. The reason \\nthey were working so hard on this company was because it was their project. They had \\ndiscovered an interesting new idea, and they just couldn't let it go.\\nMundane as it sounds, that's the most powerful motivator of all, not just in startups, but in most \\nambitious undertakings: to be genuinely interested in what you're building.

What keeps them working is the same thing that keeps anyone \\nelse working when they could stop if they wanted to: that there's nothing else they'd rather do.\\nThat, not exploiting people, is the defining quality of people who become billionaires from \\nstarting companies. So that's what YC looks for in founders: authenticity. People's motives for \\nstarting startups are usually mixed. They're usually doing it from some combination of the \\ndesire to make money, the desire to seem cool, genuine interest in the problem, and \\nunwillingness to work for someone else.

The last two are more powerful motivators than the first \\ntwo. It's ok for founders to want to make money or to seem cool. Most do. But if the founders \\nseem like they're doing it just to make money or just to seem cool, they're not likely to succeed \\non a big scale. The founders who are doing it for the money will take the first sufficiently large \\nacquisition offer, and the ones who are doing it to seem cool will rapidly discover that there are \\nmuch less painful ways of seeming cool. [3]\\nY Combinator certainly sees founders whose m.o. is to exploit people. YC is a magnet for them, \\nbecause they want the YC brand.

He took a page of notes about ideas for new \\nthings Airbnb could do.\\nWhat we didn\\'t realize when we first met Brian and Joe and Nate was that Airbnb was on its \\nlast legs.

They went there in person to visit their hosts and help them make their listings more \\nattractive. A big part of that was better pictures.

Do \\nyou want to do the kind of work where you can only win by thinking differently from everyone \\nelse? I suspect most people's unconscious mind will answer that question before their \\nconscious mind has a chance to.

And if you're naturally \\nconventional-minded, you're going to be sailing into a headwind if you try to do original \\nresearch.\\nOne difficulty here, though, is that people are often mistaken about where they fall on the \\nspectrum from conventional- to independent-minded. Conventional-minded people don't like to \\nthink of themselves as conventional-minded. And in any case, it genuinely feels to them as if \\nthey make up their own minds about everything. It's just a coincidence that their beliefs are \\nidentical to their peers'. And the independent-minded, meanwhile, are often unaware how \\ndifferent their ideas are from conventional ones, at least till they state them publicly.

[1]\\nBy the time they reach adulthood, most people know roughly how smart they are (in the narrow \\nsense of ability to solve pre-set problems), because they're constantly being tested and ranked \\naccording to it. But schools generally ignore independent-mindedness, except to the extent they \\ntry to suppress it. So we don't get anything like the same kind of feedback about how \\nindependent-minded we are.\\nThere may even be a phenomenon like Dunning-Kruger at work, where the most conventional-\\nminded people are confident that they're independent-minded, while the genuinely independent-\\nminded worry they might not be independent-minded enough.\\n___________\\nCan you make yourself more independent-minded?

I think so. This quality may be largely \\ninborn, but there seem to be ways to magnify it, or at least not to suppress it.\\nOne of the most effective techniques is one practiced unintentionally by most nerds: simply to \\nbe less aware what conventional beliefs are. It's hard to be a conformist if you don't know what \\nyou're supposed to conform to. Though again, it may be that such people already are \\nindependent-minded. A conventional-minded person would probably feel anxious not knowing \\nwhat other people thought, and make more effort to find out.\\nIt matters a lot who you surround yourself with. If you're surrounded by conventional-minded \\npeople, it will constrain which ideas you can express, and that in turn will constrain which ideas \\nyou have. But if you surround yourself with independent-minded people, you'll have the opposite \\nexperience: hearing other people say surprising things\", 'ss, and that in turn will constrain which ideas \\nyou have. But if you surround yourself with independent-minded people, you\\'ll have the opposite \\nexperience: hearing other people say surprising things will encourage you to, and to think of \\nmore.\\nBecause the independent-minded find it uncomfortable to be surrounded by conventional-\\nminded people, they tend to self-segregate once they have a chance to. The problem with high \\nschool is that they haven\\'t yet had a chance to. Plus high school tends to be an inward-looking \\nlittle world whose inhabitants lack confidence, both of which magnify the forces of conformism. \\nSo high school is often a bad time for the independent-minded. But there is some advantage \\neven here: it teaches you what to avoid. If you later find yourself in a situation that makes you \\nthink \"this is like high school,\" you know you should get out.

The founder', 't makes you \\nthink \"this is like high school,\" you know you should get out. [2]\\nAnother place where the independent- and conventional-minded are thrown together is in \\nsuccessful startups. The founders and early employees are almost always independent-minded; \\notherwise the startup wouldn\\'t be successful. But conventional-minded people greatly \\noutnumber independent-minded ones, so as the company grows, the original spirit of \\nindependent-mindedness is inevitably diluted. This causes all kinds of problems besides the \\nobvious one that the company starts to suck. One of the strangest is that the founders find \\nthemselves able to speak more freely with founders of other companies than with their own \\nemployees. [3]\\nFortunately you don\\'t have to spend all your time with independent-minded people. It\\'s enough \\nto have one or two you can talk to regularly.

Although universities no longer have the kind of monopoly \\nthey used to have on education, good universities are still an excellent way to meet \\nindependent-minded people. Most students will still be conventional-minded, but you'll at least \\nfind clumps of independent-minded ones, rather than the near zero you may have found in high \\nschool.\\nIt also works to go in the other direction: as well as cultivating a small collection of independent-\\nminded friends, to try to meet as many different types of people as you can. It will decrease the \\ninfluence of your immediate peers if you have several other groups of peers. Plus if you're part \\nof several different worlds, you can often import ideas from one to another.\\nBut by different types of people, I don't mean demographically different.

When I meet \\nsomeone who knows a lot about something unusual (which includes practically everyone, if you \\ndig deep enough), I try to learn what they know that other people don't. There are almost \\nalways surprises here. It's a good way to make conversation when you meet strangers, but I \\ndon't do it to make conversation. I really want to know.\\nYou can expand the source of influences in time as well as space, by reading history.

I\\'m not \\nsuggesting that you impose on everyone who talks to you the burden of proving what they say, \\nbut rather that you take upon yourself the burden of evaluating what they say.\\nTreat it as a puzzle.

And you\\'ll be surprised, when \\nyou start asking \"Is this true?\", how often the answer is not an immediate yes. If you have any \\nimagination, you\\'re more likely to have too many leads to follow than too few.\\nMore generally your goal should be not to let anything into your head unexamined, and things \\ndon\\'t always enter your head in the form of statements. Some of the most powerful influences \\nare implicit. How do you even notice these? By standing back and watching how other people \\nget their ideas.\\nWhen you stand back at a sufficient distance, you can see ideas spreading through groups of \\npeople like waves.

Not just because you want sovereignty over your \\nown thoughts, but because unfashionable ideas are disproportionately likely to lead somewhere \\ninteresting. The best place to find undiscovered ideas is where no one else is looking. [4]\\n___________\\nTo go beyond this general advice, we need to look at the internal structure of independent-\\nmindedness ÿý at the individual muscles we need to exercise, as it were. It seems to me that it \\nhas three components: fastidiousness about truth, resistance to being told what to think, and \\ncuriosity.\\nFastidiousness about truth means more than just not believing things\", \". It seems to me that it \\nhas three components: fastidiousness about truth, resistance to being told what to think, and \\ncuriosity.\\nFastidiousness about truth means more than just not believing things that are false. It means \\nbeing careful about degree of belief. For most people, degree of belief rushes unexamined \\ntoward the extremes: the unlikely becomes impossible, and the probable becomes certain. [5] \\nTo the independent-minded, this seems unpardonably sloppy. They're willing to have anything in \\ntheir heads, from highly speculative hypotheses to (apparent) tautologies, but on subjects they \\ncare about, everything has to be labelled with a carefully considered degree of belief. [6]\\nThe independent-minded thus have a horror of ideologies, which require one to accept a whole \\ncollection of beliefs at once, and to treat them as articles of faith. To an independent-minded \\nperson that would seem revolting, just as it would seem to someone fastidious about food to \\ntake a bite of a sub\", \" of beliefs at once, and to treat them as articles of faith. To an independent-minded \\nperson that would seem revolting, just as it would seem to someone fastidious about food to \\ntake a bite of a submarine sandwich filled with a large variety of ingredients of indeterminate \\nage and provenance.\\nWithout this fastidiousness about truth, you can't be truly independent-minded. It's not enough \\njust to have resistance to being told what to think. Those kind of people reject conventional \\nideas only to replace them with the most random conspiracy theories. And since these \\nconspiracy theories have often been manufactured to capture them, they end up being less \\nindependent-minded than ordinary people, because they're subject to a much more exacting \\nmaster than mere convention. [7]\\nCan you increase your fastidiousness about truth? I would think so. In my experience, merely \\nthinking about something you're fastidious about causes that fastidiousness to grow. If so, this is \\none of those rare\", \"ease your fastidiousness about truth? I would think so. In my experience, merely \\nthinking about something you're fastidious about causes that fastidiousness to grow. If so, this is \\none of those rare virtues we can have more of merely by wanting it. And if it's like other forms of \\nfastidiousness, it should also be possible to encourage in children. I certainly got a strong dose \\nof it from my father. [8]\\nThe second component of independent-mindedness, resistance to being told what to think, is \\nthe most visible of the three. But even this is often misunderstood. The big mistake people \\nmake about it is to think of it as a merely negative quality. The language we use reinforces that \\nidea. You're unconventional. You don't care what other people think. But it's not just a kind of \\nimmunity. In the most independent-minded people, the desire not to be told what to think is a \\npositive force.

In the most independent-minded people, the desire not to be told what to think is a \\npositive force. It's not mere skepticism, but an active delight in ideas that subvert the \\nconventional wisdom, the more counterintuitive the better.\\nSome of the most novel ideas seemed at the time almost like practical jokes. Think how often \\nyour reaction to a novel idea is to laugh. I don't think it's because novel ideas are funny per se, \\nbut because novelty and humor share a certain kind of surprisingness. But while not identical, \\nthe two are close enough that there is a definite correlation between having a sense of humor \\nand being independent-minded ÿý just as there is between being humorless and being \\nconventional-minded. [9]\\nI don't think we can significantly increase our resistance to being told what to think. It seems the \\nmost innate of the three components of independent-mindedness; people who have this quality \\nas adults usually showed all too visible signs of it as children. But if \", \"told what to think. It seems the \\nmost innate of the three components of independent-mindedness; people who have this quality \\nas adults usually showed all too visible signs of it as children. But if we can't increase our \\nresistance to being told what to think, we can at least shore it up, by surrounding ourselves with \\nother independent-minded people.\\nThe third component of independent-mindedness, curiosity, may be the most interesting. To the \\nextent that we can give a brief answer to the question of where novel ideas come from, it's \\ncuriosity. That's what people are usually feeling before having them.\\nIn my experience, independent-mindedness and curiosity predict one another perfectly. \\nEveryone I know who's independent-minded is deeply curious, and everyone I know who's \\nconventional-minded isn't. Except, curiously, children. All small children are curious. Perhaps \\nthe reason is that even the conventional-minded have to be curious in the beginning, in order to \\nlearn what the co\", \"-minded isn't. Except, curiously, children. All small children are curious. Perhaps \\nthe reason is that even the conventional-minded have to be curious in the beginning, in order to \\nlearn what the conventions are. Whereas the independent-minded are the gluttons of curiosity, \\nwho keep eating even after they're full. [10]\\nThe three components of independent-mindedness work in concert: fastidiousness about truth \\nand resistance to being told what to think leave space in your brain, and curiosity finds new \\nideas to fill it.\\nInterestingly, the three components can substitute for one another in much the same way \\nmuscles can. If you're sufficiently fastidious about truth, you don't need to be as resistant to \\nbeing told what to think, because fastidiousness alone will create sufficient gaps in your \\nknowledge. And either one can compensate for curiosity, because if you create enough space \\nin your brain, your discomfort at the resulting vacuum will add force to your curiosity. Or \\ncuriosi\", 'n your \\nknowledge. And either one can compensate for curiosity, because if you create enough space \\nin your brain, your discomfort at the resulting vacuum will add force to your curiosity. Or \\ncuriosity can compensate for them: if you\\'re sufficiently curious, you don\\'t need to clear space in \\nyour brain, because the new ideas you discover will push out the conventional ones you \\nacquired by default.\\nBecause the components of independent-mindedness are so interchangeable, you can have \\nthem to varying degrees and still get the same result. So there is not just a single model of \\nindependent-mindedness. Some independent-minded people are openly subversive, and others \\nare quietly curious. They all know the secret handshake though.\\nIs there a way to cultivate curiosity? To start with, you want to avoid situations that suppress it. \\nHow much does the work you\\'re currently doing engage your curiosity? If the answer is \"not \\nmuch,\" maybe you should change something.\\nThe most important active', 't to avoid situations that suppress it. \\nHow much does the work you\\'re currently doing engage your curiosity?

Few adults are equally curious about everything, and it doesn\\'t seem \\nas if you can choose which topics interest you. So it\\'s up to you to find them. Or invent them, if \\nnecessary.\\nAnother way to increase your curiosity is to indulge it, by investigating things you\\'re interested \\nin. Curiosity is unlike most other appetites in this respect: indulging it tends to increase rather \\nthan to sate it. Questions lead to more questions.\\nCuriosity seems to be more individual than fastidiousness about truth or resistance to being told \\nwhat to think. To the degree people have the latter two, they\\'re usually pretty general, whereas \\ndifferent people can be curious about very different things. So perhaps', 'h or resistance to being told \\nwhat to think. To the degree people have the latter two, they\\'re usually pretty general, whereas \\ndifferent people can be curious about very different things. So perhaps curiosity is the compass \\nhere. Perhaps, if your goal is to discover novel ideas, your motto should not be \"do what you \\nlove\" so much as \"do what you\\'re curious about.\"\\nNotes:\\n[1] One convenient consequence of the fact that no one identifies as conventional-minded is that you can say what \\nyou like about conventional-minded people without getting in too much trouble. When I wrote \"The Four Quadrants of \\nConformism\" I expected a firestorm of rage from the aggressively conventional-minded, but in fact it was quite muted. \\nThey sensed that there was something about the essay that they disliked intensely, but they had a hard time finding a \\nspecific passage to pin it on.\\n[2] When I ask myself what in my life is like high school, the answer is Twitter.

But while it probably is a net loss to spend time there, it has at least made me think \\nmore about the distinction between independent- and conventional-mindedness, which I probably wouldn't have done \\notherwise.\\n[3] The decrease in independent-mindedness in growing startups is still an open problem, but there may be solutions.\\nFounders can delay the problem by making a conscious effort only to hire independent-minded people.

You think hiring that junior PR \\nperson will be cheap, compared to a programmer, but what will be the effect on the average level of independent-\\nmindedness in your company?

One of the reasons politics, for example, \\ntends to be boring is that it\\'s so extremely subject to them. The threshold for having opinions about politics is much \\nlower than the one for having opinions about set theory.

To start a painting saying that it's just a sketch, or a new piece of software saying that it's \\njust a quick hack. Then you judge your initial results by a lower standard. Once the project is \\nrolling you can sneakily convert it to something more. [4]\\nThis will be easier if you use a medium that lets you work fast and doesn't require too much \\ncommitment up front.

A wealth tax of 1% \\nmeans you get to keep 99% of your stock each year. After 60 years the proportion of stock you'll \\nhave left will be .99^60, or .547. So a straight 1% wealth tax means the government will over \\nthe course of your life take 45% of your stock.\\n(Losing shares does not, obviously, mean becoming net poorer unless the value per share is \\nincreasing by less than the wealth tax rate.)\\nHere's how much stock the government would take over 60 years at various levels of wealth tax:\\n wealth taxgovernment takes 0.1%6%0.5%26% 1.0%45% 2.0%70% 3.0%84% \\n4.0%91%5.0%95% A wealth tax will usually have a threshold at which it starts.

Imagine a Cartesian coordinate system whose horizontal axis runs from \\nconventional-minded on the left to independent-minded on the right, and whose vertical axis \\nruns from passive at the bottom to aggressive at the top. The resulting four quadrants define \\nfour types of people. Starting in the upper left and going counter-clockwise: aggressively \", \"ertical axis \\nruns from passive at the bottom to aggressive at the top. The resulting four quadrants define \\nfour types of people. Starting in the upper left and going counter-clockwise: aggressively \\nconventional-minded, passively conventional-minded, passively independent-minded, and \\naggressively independent-minded.\\nI think that you'll find all four types in most societies, and that which quadrant people fall into \\ndepends more on their own personality than the beliefs prevalent in their society. [1]\\nYoung children offer some of the best evidence for both points. Anyone who's been to primary \\nschool has seen the four types, and the fact that school rules are so arbitrary is strong evidence \\nthat which quadrant people fall into depends more on them than the rules.\\nThe kids in the upper left quadrant, the aggressively conventional-minded ones, are the \\ntattletales. They believe not only that rules must be obeyed, but that those who disobey them \\nmust be punished.\\nThe kids in the lower\", \"eft quadrant, the aggressively conventional-minded ones, are the \\ntattletales.

When they see a rule, their first impulse is to question it. Merely being told what to do \\nmakes them inclined to do the opposite.\\nWhen measuring conformism, of course, you have to say with respect to what, and this \\nchanges as kids get older. For younger kids it's the rules set by adults. \", 'makes them inclined to do the opposite.\\nWhen measuring conformism, of course, you have to say with respect to what, and this \\nchanges as kids get older. For younger kids it\\'s the rules set by adults. But as kids get older, the \\nsource of rules becomes their peers. So a pack of teenagers who all flout school rules in the \\nsame way are not independent-minded; rather the opposite.\\nIn adulthood we can recognize the four types by their distinctive calls, much as you could \\nrecognize four species of birds. The call of the aggressively conventional-minded is \"Crush \\n<outgroup>!\" (It\\'s rather alarming to see an exclamation point after a variable, but that\\'s the \\nwhole problem with the aggressively conventional-minded.) The call of the passively \\nconventional-minded is \"What will the neighbors think?\" The call of the passively independent-\\nminded is \"To each his own.\" And the call of the aggressively independent-minded is \"Eppur si \\nmuove.\"\\nThe four types are not equally common.

So the passively \\nconventional-minded are the largest group, and the aggressively independent-minded the \\nsmallest.\\nSince one\\'s quadrant depends more on one\\'s personality than the nature of the rules, most \\npeople would occupy the same quadrant even if they\\'d grown up in a quite different society.\\nPrinceton professor Robert George recently wrote: I sometimes ask students what their position \\non slavery would have been had they been white and living in the South before abolition.

In \\nother words, that they'd not only not have fought against slavery, but that they'd have been \\namong its staunchest defenders.\\nI'm biased, I admit, but it seems to me that aggressively conventional-minded people are \\nresponsible for a disproportionate amount of the trouble in the world, and that a lot of the \\ncustoms we've evolved since the Enlightenment have been designed to protect the rest of us \\nfrom them.

In particular, the retirement of the concept of heresy and its replacement by the \\nprinciple of freely debating all sorts of different ideas, even ones that are currently considered \\nunacceptable, without any punishment for those who try them out to see if they work. [2]\\nWhy do the independent-minded need to be protected, though? Because they have all the new \\nideas. To be a successful scientist, for example, it's not enough just to be right. You have to be \\nright when everyone else is wrong. Conventional-minded people can't do that. For similar \\nreasons, all successful startup CEOs are not merely independent-minded, but aggressively so. \\nSo it's no coincidence that societies prosper only to the extent that they have customs for \\nkeeping the conventional-minded at bay. [3]\\nIn the last few years, many of us have noticed that the customs protecting free inquiry have \\nbeen weakened. Some say we're overreacting \", \" have customs for \\nkeeping the conventional-minded at bay.

When the conventional-minded get the upper hand, they always say it's in the \\nservice of a greater good. It just happens to be a different, incompatible greater good each time.\\nAs for the former worry, that the independent-minded are being oversensitive, and that free \\ninquiry hasn't been shut down that much, you can't judge that unless you are yourself \\nindependent-minded. You can't know how much of the space of ideas is being lopped off unless \\nyou have them, and only the independent-minded have the ones at the edges. Precisely \\nbecause of this, they tend to be very sensitive to changes in how freely one can explore ideas. \\nThey're the ca\", 's \\nyou have them, and only the independent-minded have the ones at the edges. Precisely \\nbecause of this, they tend to be very sensitive to changes in how freely one can explore ideas. \\nThey\\'re the canaries in this coalmine.\\nThe conventional-minded say, as they always do, that they don\\'t want to shut down the \\ndiscussion of all ideas, just the bad ones.\\nYou\\'d think it would be obvious just from that sentence what a dangerous game they\\'re playing. \\nBut I\\'ll spell it out. There are two reasons why we need to be able to discuss even \"bad\" ideas.\\nThe first is that any process for deciding which ideas to ban is bound to make mistakes. All the \\nmore so because no one intelligent wants to undertake that kind of work, so it ends up being \\ndone by the stupid. And when a process makes a lot of mistakes, you need to leave a margin \\nfor error. Which in this case means you need to ban fewer ideas than you\\'d like to. But that\\'s \\nhard for the aggressively conventional-minded to do, partly because the', \"kes, you need to leave a margin \\nfor error. Which in this case means you need to ban fewer ideas than you'd like to. But that's \\nhard for the aggressively conventional-minded to do, partly because they enjoy seeing people \\npunished, as they have since they were children, and partly because they compete with one \\nanother. Enforcers of orthodoxy can't allow a borderline idea to exist, because that gives other \\nenforcers an opportunity to one-up them in the moral purity department, and perhaps even to \\nturn enforcer upon them. So instead of getting the margin for error we need, we get the \\nopposite: a race to the bottom in which any idea that seems at all bannable ends up being \\nbanned. [4]\\nThe second reason it's dangerous to ban the discussion of ideas is that ideas are more closely \\nrelated than they look. Which means if you restrict the discussion of some topics, it doesn't only \\naffect those topics. The restrictions propagate back into any topic that yields implications in the \\nforbid\", \" than they look. Which means if you restrict the discussion of some topics, it doesn't only \\naffect those topics. The restrictions propagate back into any topic that yields implications in the \\nforbidden ones. And that is not an edge case. The best ideas do exactly that: they have \\nconsequences in fields far removed from their origins. Having ideas in a world where some \\nideas are banned is like playing soccer on a pitch that has a minefield in one corner. You don't \\njust play the same game you would have, but on a different shaped pitch. You play a much more \\nsubdued game even on the ground that's safe.\\nIn the past, the way the independent-minded protected themselves was to congregate in a \\nhandful of places ÿý first in courts, and later in universities ÿý where they could to some extent make \\ntheir own rules. Places where people work with ideas tend to have customs protecting free \\ninquiry, for the same reason wafer fabs have powerful air filters, or recording studios good \\nsound ins\", \"make \\ntheir own rules.

For the last couple centuries at least, when the aggressively conventional-\\nminded were on the rampage for whatever reason, universities were the safest places to be.\\nThat may not work this time though, due to the unfortunate fact that the latest wave of \\nintolerance began in universities. It began in the mid 1980s, and by 2000 seemed to have died \\ndown, but it has recently flared up again with the arrival of social media. This seems, \\nunfortunately, to have been an own goal by Silicon Valley.

If these people had \\nbeen professors, they'd have put up a stiffer resistance on behalf of academic freedom. So \\nperhaps the picture of the independent-minded fleeing declining universities is too gloomy. \\nPerhaps the universities are declining because so many have already left.

But I think we can aim for something more ambitious: that an essay \\nshould be useful.\\nTo start with, that means it should be correct. But it\\'s not enough merely to be correct. It\\'s easy \\nto make a statement correct by making it vague. That\\'s a common flaw in academic writing, for \\nexample. If you know nothing at all about an issue, you can\\'t go wrong by saying that the issue \\nis a complex one, that there are many factors to be considered, that it\\'s a mistake to take too \\nsimplistic a view o', \"ou know nothing at all about an issue, you can't go wrong by saying that the issue \\nis a complex one, that there are many factors to be considered, that it's a mistake to take too \\nsimplistic a view of it, and so on.\\nThough no doubt correct, such statements tell the reader nothing. Useful writing makes claims \\nthat are as strong as they can be made without becoming false.\\nFor example, it's more useful to say that Pike's Peak is near the middle of Colorado than merely \\nsomewhere in Colorado. But if I say it's in the exact middle of Colorado, I've now gone too far, \\nbecause it's a bit east of the middle.\\nPrecision and correctness are like opposing forces. It's easy to satisfy one if you ignore the \\nother. The converse of vaporous academic writing is the bold, but false, rhetoric of \\ndemagogues. Useful writing is bold, but true.\\nIt's also two other things: it tells people something important, and that at least some of them \\ndidn't already know.\\nTelling people something they didn't know do\", \"es. Useful writing is bold, but true.\\nIt's also two other things: it tells people something important, and that at least some of them \\ndidn't already know.\\nTelling people something they didn't know doesn't always mean surprising them. Sometimes it \\nmeans telling them something they knew unconsciously but had never put into words. In fact \\nthose may be the more valuable insights, because they tend to be more fundamental.\\nLet's put them all together. Useful writing tells people something true and important that they \\ndidn't already know, and tells them as unequivocally as possible.\\nNotice these are all a matter of degree. For example, you can't expect an idea to be novel to \\neveryone. Any insight that you have will probably have already been had by at least one of the \\nworld's 7 billion people. But it's sufficient if an idea is novel to a lot of readers.\\nDitto for correctness, importance, and strength. In effect the four components are like numbers \\nyou can multiply together to get a sco\", \"le.

In effect the four components are like numbers \\nyou can multiply together to get a score for usefulness. Which I realize is almost awkwardly \\nreductive, but nonetheless true.\\n_____\\nHow can you ensure that the things you say are true and novel and important? Believe it or not, \\nthere is a trick for doing this. I learned it from my friend Robert Morris, who has a horror of \\nsaying anything dumb. His trick is not to say anything unless he's sure it's worth hearing. This \\nmakes it hard to get opinions out of him, but when you do, they're usually right.\\nTranslated into essay writing, what this means is that if you write a bad sentence, you don't \\npublish it. You delete it and try again. Often you abandon whole branches of four or five \\nparagraphs. Sometimes a whole essay.\\nYou can't ensure that every idea you have is good, but you can ensure that every one you \\npublish is, by sim\", \"ain. Often you abandon whole branches of four or five \\nparagraphs. Sometimes a whole essay.\\nYou can't ensure that every idea you have is good, but you can ensure that every one you \\npublish is, by simply not publishing the ones that aren't.\\nIn the sciences, this is called publication bias, and is considered bad. When some hypothesis \\nyou're exploring gets inconclusive results, you're supposed to tell people about that too. But with \\nessay writing, publication bias is the way to go.\\nMy strategy is loose, then tight. I write the first draft of an essay fast, trying out all kinds of \\nideas. Then I spend days rewriting it very carefully.\\nI've never tried to count how many times I proofread essays, but I'm sure there are sentences \\nI've read 100 times before publishing them. When I proofread an essay, there are usually \\npassages that stick out in an annoying way, sometimes because they're clumsily written, and \\nsometimes because I'm not sure they're true.

The annoyance starts out unconscious, but after \\nthe tenth reading or so I\\'m saying \"Ugh, that part\" each time I hit it. They become like briars that \\ncatch your sleeve as you walk past. Usually I won\\'t publish an essay till they\\'re all gone ÿý till I can \\nread through the whole thing without the feeling of anything catching.\\nI\\'ll sometimes let through a sentence that seems clumsy, if I can\\'t think of a way to rephrase it, \\nbut I will never knowingly let through one that doesn\\'t seem correct. You never have to. If a \\nsentence doesn\\'t seem right, all you have to do is ask why it doesn\\'t, and you\\'ve usually got the \\nreplacement right there in your head.\\nThis is where essayists have an advantage over journalists. You don\\'t have a deadline. You can \\nwork for as long on an essay as you need to get it right. You don\\'t have to pub', 'ight there in your head.\\nThis is where essayists have an advantage over journalists. You don\\'t have a deadline. You can \\nwork for as long on an essay as you need to get it right. You don\\'t have to publish the essay at \\nall, if you can\\'t get it right. Mistakes seem to lose courage in the face of an enemy with unlimited \\nresources. Or that\\'s what it feels like. What\\'s really going on is that you have different \\nexpectations for yourself. You\\'re like a parent saying to a child \"we can sit here all night till you \\neat your vegetables.\" Except you\\'re the child too.\\nI\\'m not saying no mistake gets through. For example, I added condition (c) in \"A Way to Detect \\nBias\" after readers pointed out that I\\'d omitted it. But in practice you can catch nearly all of them.\\nThere\\'s a trick for getting importance too. It\\'s like the trick I suggest to young founders for \\ngetting startup ideas: to make something you yourself want. You can use yourself as a proxy for \\nthe reader. The reader is not completely', \"ance too. It's like the trick I suggest to young founders for \\ngetting startup ideas: to make something you yourself want. You can use yourself as a proxy for \\nthe reader. The reader is not completely unlike you, so if you write about topics that seem \\nimportant to you, they'll probably seem important to a significant number of readers as well.\\nImportance has two factors. It's the number of people something matters to, times how much it \\nmatters to them. Which means of course that it's not a rectangle, but a sort of ragged comb, like \\na Riemann sum.\\nThe way to get novelty is to write about topics you've thought about a lot. Then you can use \\nyourself as a proxy for the reader in this department too. Anything you notice that surprises you, \\nwho've thought about the topic a lot, will probably also surprise a significant number of readers. \\nAnd here, as with correctness and importance, you can use the Morris technique to ensure that \\nyou will. If you don't learn anything from writing an e\", \"y also surprise a significant number of readers. \\nAnd here, as with correctness and importance, you can use the Morris technique to ensure that \\nyou will. If you don't learn anything from writing an essay, don't publish it.\\nYou need humility to measure novelty, because acknowledging the novelty of an idea means \\nacknowledging your previous ignorance of it. Confidence and humility are often seen as \\nopposites, but in this case, as in many others, confidence helps you to be humble. If you know \\nyou're an expert on some topic, you can freely admit when you learn something you didn't \\nknow, because you can be confident that most other people wouldn't know it either.\\nThe fourth component of useful writing, strength, comes from two things: thinking well, and the \\nskillful use of qualification. These two counterbalance each other, like the accelerator and clutch \\nin a car with a manual transmission. As you try to refine the expression of an idea, you adjust \\nthe qualification accordingly. Som\", 'hese two counterbalance each other, like the accelerator and clutch \\nin a car with a manual transmission. As you try to refine the expression of an idea, you adjust \\nthe qualification accordingly. Something you\\'re sure of, you can state baldly with no qualification \\nat all, as I did the four components of useful writing. Whereas points that seem dubious have to \\nbe held at arm\\'s length with perhapses.\\nAs you refine an idea, you\\'re pushing in the direction of less qualification. But you can rarely get \\nit down to zero. Sometimes you don\\'t even want to, if it\\'s a side point and a fully refined version \\nwould be too long.\\nSome say that qualifications weaken writing. For example, that you should never begin a \\nsentence in an essay with \"I think,\" because if you\\'re saying it, then of course you think it. And \\nit\\'s true that \"I think x\" is a weaker statement than simply \"x.\" Which is exactly why you need \"I \\nthink.\" You need it to express your degree of certainty.\\nBut qualifications are not ', ' think it. And \\nit\\'s true that \"I think x\" is a weaker statement than simply \"x.\" Which is exactly why you need \"I \\nthink.\" You need it to express your degree of certainty.\\nBut qualifications are not scalars. They\\'re not just experimental error. There must be 50 things \\nthey can express: how broadly something applies, how you know it, how happy you are it\\'s so, \\neven how it could be falsified. I\\'m not going to try to explore the structure of qualification here. \\nIt\\'s probably more complex than the whole topic of writing usefully. Instead I\\'ll just give you a \\npractical tip: Don\\'t underestimate qualification. It\\'s an important skill in its own right, not just a \\nsort of tax you have to pay in order to avoid saying things that are false. So learn and use its full \\nrange. It may not be fully half of having good ideas, but it\\'s part of having them.\\nThere\\'s one other quality I aim for in essays: to say things as simply as possible. But I don\\'t \\nthink this is a component of usefulness.

And \\nit's a practical aid in getting things right; a mistake is more obvious when expressed in simple \\nlanguage. But I'll admit that the main reason I write simply is not for the reader's sake or \\nbecause it helps get things right, but because it bothers me to use more or fancier words than I \\nneed to. It seems inelegant, like a program that's too long.\\nI realize florid writing works for some people. But unless you're sure you're one of them, the \\nbest advice is to write as simply as you can.\\n_____\\nI believe the formula I've given you, importance + novelty + correctness + strength, is the recipe \\nfor a good essay. But I should warn you that it's also a recipe for making people mad.\\nThe root of the problem is novelty. When you tell people somet\", \"+ novelty + correctness + strength, is the recipe \\nfor a good essay. But I should warn you that it's also a recipe for making people mad.\\nThe root of the problem is novelty. When you tell people something they didn't know, they don't \\nalways thank you for it. Sometimes the reason people don't know something is because they \\ndon't want to know it. Usually because it contradicts some cherished belief. And indeed, if you're \\nlooking for novel ideas, popular but mistaken beliefs are a good place to find them. Every \\npopular mistaken belief creates a dead zone of ideas around it that are relatively unexplored \\nbecause they contradict it.\\nThe strength component just makes things worse. If there's anything that annoys people more \\nthan having their cherished assumptions contradicted, it's having them flatly contradicted.\\nPlus if you've used the Morris technique, your writing will seem quite confident. Perhaps \\noffensively confident, to people who disagree with you.

Perhaps \\noffensively confident, to people who disagree with you. The reason you\\'ll seem confident is that \\nyou are confident: you\\'ve cheated, by only publishing the things you\\'re sure of. It will seem to \\npeople who try to disagree with you that you never admit you\\'re wrong. In fact you constantly \\nadmit you\\'re wrong. You just do it before publishing instead of after.\\nAnd if your writing is as simple as possible, that just makes things worse. Brevity is the diction \\nof command. If you watch someone delivering unwelcome news from a position of inferiority, \\nyou\\'ll notice they tend to use lots of words, to soften the blow. Whereas to be short with \\nsomeone is more or less to be rude to them.\\nIt can sometimes work to deliberately phrase statements more weakly than you mean.

It\\'s cheesy to adopt an ironic tone for a whole essay. I think we \\njust have to face the fact that elegance and curtness are two names for the same thing.\\nYou might think that if you work sufficiently hard to ensure that an essay is correct, it will be \\ninvulnerable to attack. That\\'s sort of true. It will be invulnerable to valid attacks. But in practice \\nthat\\'s little consolation.\\nIn fact, the strength component of useful writing will make you particularly vulnerable to \\nmisrepresentation. If you\\'ve stated an idea as strongly as you could without making it false, all \\nanyone has to do is to exaggerate slightly what you said, and now it is false.\\nMuch of the time they\\'re not even doing it deliberately.

One of the most surprising things you\\'ll \\ndiscover, if you start writing essays, is that people who disagree with you rarely disagree with \\nwhat you\\'ve actually written. Instead they make up something you said and disagree with that.\\nFor what it\\'s worth, the countermove is to ask someone who does this to quote a specific \\nsentence or passage you wrote that they believe is false, and explain why. I say \"for what it\\'s \\nworth\" because they never do. So although it might seem that this could get a broken \\ndiscussion back on track, the truth is that it was never on track in the first place.\\nShould you explicitly forestall likely misinterpretations?

My guess is that\\'s a moot point, \\nbecause they never will. I\\'ve been able to observe for long enough that I\\'m fairly confident the \\npattern works both ways: not only do people who do great work never become haters, haters \\nnever do great work. Although I dislike the word \"fanboy,\" it\\'s evocative of something important \\nabout both haters and fanboys.

When you have a \\ndispute with someone, it\\'s usually a good idea to try to understand why they\\'re upset and then \\nfix things if you can. Disputes are distracting. But it\\'s a false analogy to think of a hater as \\nsomeone you have a dispute with. It\\'s an understandable mistake, if you\\'ve never encountered \\nhaters before. But when you realize that you\\'re dealing with a hater, and what a hater is, it\\'s \\nclear that it\\'s a waste of time even to think about them. If you have obsessive fans, do you \\nspend any time wondering what makes them love you so much?

Intentional \\nmoderates are trimmers, deliberately choosing a position mid-way between the extremes of \\nright and left.

If \\nthe far left opinion on some matter is 0 and the far right opinion 100, an intentional moderate's \\nopinion on every question will be near 50.

The defining quality of an ideologue, whether on the left or the \\nright, is to acquire one\\'s opinions in bulk. You don\\'t get to pick and choose. Your opinions about \\ntaxation can be predicted from your opinions about sex. And although intentional moderates \\nmight seem to be the opposite of ideologues, their beliefs (though in their case the word \\n\"positions\" might be more accurate) are also acquired in bulk. If the median opinion shifts to the \\nright or left, the intentional moderate must shift with it. Otherwise they stop being moderate.\\nAccidental moderates, on the other hand, not only choose their own answers, but choose their \\nown questions.

Up to that point I felt about kids the way the young \\nAugustine felt about living virtuously. I'd have been sad to think I'd never have children. But did I \\nwant them now? No.\\nIf I had kids, I'd become a parent, and parents, as I'd known since I was a kid, were uncool. \\nThey were dull and responsible and had no fun. And while it's not surprising that kids would \\nbelieve that, to be honest I hadn't seen much as an adult to change my mind. Whenever I'd \\nnoticed parents with kids, the kids seemed \", 'le and had no fun. And while it\\'s not surprising that kids would \\nbelieve that, to be honest I hadn\\'t seen much as an adult to change my mind. Whenever I\\'d \\nnoticed parents with kids, the kids seemed to be terrors, and the parents pathetic harried \\ncreatures, even when they prevailed.\\nWhen people had babies, I congratulated them enthusiastically, because that seemed to be \\nwhat one did. But I didn\\'t feel it at all. \"Better you than me,\" I was thinking.\\nNow when people have babies I congratulate them enthusiastically and I mean it. Especially the \\nfirst one. I feel like they just got the best gift in the world.\\nWhat changed, of course, is that I had kids. Something I dreaded turned out to be wonderful.\\nPartly, and I won\\'t deny it, this is because of serious chemical changes that happened almost \\ninstantly when our first child was born. It was like someone flipped a switch. I suddenly felt \\nprotective not just toward our child, but toward all children.

I suddenly felt \\nprotective not just toward our child, but toward all children. As I was driving my wife and new \\nson home from the hospital, I approached a crosswalk full of pedestrians, and I found myself \\nthinking \"I have to be really careful of all these people. Every one of them is someone\\'s child!\"\\nSo to some extent you can\\'t trust me when I say having kids is great. To some extent I\\'m like a \\nreligious cultist telling you that you\\'ll be happy if you join the cult too ÿý but only because joining \\nthe cult will alter your mind in a way that will make you happy to be a cult member.\\nBut not entirely.

Some parents may have noticed that I wrote \"Whenever I\\'d noticed parents with kids.\" \\nOf course the times I noticed kids were when things were going wrong. I only noticed them \\nwhen they made noise. And where was I when I noticed them? Ordinarily I never went to places \\nwith kids, so the only times I encountered them were in shared bottlenecks like airplanes. \\nWhich is not exactly a representative sample. Flying with a toddler is something very few \\nparents enjoy.\\nWhat I didn\\'t notice, because they tend to be much quieter, were all the great moments parents \\nhad with kids. People don\\'t talk about these much ÿý the magic is hard to put into words, and all \\nother parents know about them anyway ÿý but one of the great things about having kids is that \\nthere are so many times when you feel there is nowhere else you\\'d rather be, and nothing else \\nyou\\'d rather be doing.

You don't have to be doing anything special. You could just be going \\nsomewhere together, or putting them to bed, or pushing them on the swings at the park. But \\nyou wouldn't trade these moments for anything. One doesn't tend to associate kids with peace, \\nbut that's what you feel. You don't need to look any further than where you are right now.\\nBefore I had kids, I had moments of this kind of peace, but they were rarer. With kids it can \\nhappen several times a day.\\nMy other source of data about kids was my own childhood, and that was similarly misleading. I \\nwas pretty bad, and was always in trouble for something or other. So it seemed to me that \\nparenthood was essentially law enforcement. I didn't realize there were good times too.\\nI remember my mother telling me once when I was about 30 that she'd really enjoyed having \\nme an\", \"med to me that \\nparenthood was essentially law enforcement. I didn't realize there were good times too.\\nI remember my mother telling me once when I was about 30 that she'd really enjoyed having \\nme and my sister. My god, I thought, this woman is a saint. She not only endured all the pain we \\nsubjected her to, but actually enjoyed it? Now I realize she was simply telling the truth.\\nShe said that one reason she liked having us was that we'd been interesting to talk to. That took \\nme by surprise when I had kids. You don't just love them. They become your friends too. They're \\nreally interesting. And while I admit small children are disastrously fond of repetition (anything \\nworth doing once is worth doing fifty times) it's often genuinely fun to play with them. That \\nsurprised me too. Playing with a 2 year old was fun when I was 2 and definitely not fun when I \\nwas 6. Why would it become fun again later? But it does.\\nThere are of course times that are pure drudgery.

But it is not, \\nas I implicitly believed before having kids, simply your DNA heading for the lifeboats.\\nSome of my worries about having kids were right, though. They definitely make you less \\nproductive. I know having kids makes some people get their act together, but if your act was \\nalready together, you're going to have less time to do it in. In particular, you're going to have to \\nwork to a schedule. Kids have schedules. I'm not sure if it's because that's how kids are, or \\nbecause it's the only way to integrate their lives with adults', but once you have kids, you tend to \\nhave to work on their schedule.\\nYou will have chunks of time to work.

You're going to have to work at the same time every \\nday, whether inspiration is flowing or not, and there are going to be times when you have to \\nstop, even if it is.\\nI've been able to adapt to working this way. Work, like love, finds a way. If there are only certain \\ntimes it can happen, it happens at those times. So while I don't get as much done as before I \\nhad kids, I get enough done.\\nI hate to say this, because being ambitious has always been a part of my identity, but having \\nkids may make one less ambitious.

Once you have \\nkids, it will often be your kids, and that means it will less often be some project you're working \\non.\\nI have some hacks for sailing close to this wind. For example, when I write essays, I think about \\nwhat I'd want my kids to know. That drives me to get things right. And when I was writing Bel, I \\ntold my kids that once I finished it I'd take them to Africa. When you say that sort of thing to a \\nlittle kid, they treat it as a promise. Which meant I had to finish or I'd be taking away their trip to \\nAfrica. Maybe if I'm really lucky such tricks could put me net ahead.

Well enough to miss some things a lot, like \\nthe ability to take off for some other country at a moment's notice. That was so great. Why did I \\nnever do that?\\nSee what I did there?

In practice, the freakishly \\nspecific nature of the stuff ambitious kids have to do in high school is directly proportionate to \\nthe hackability of college admissions. The classes you don\\'t care about that are mostly \\nmemorization, the random \"extracurricular activities\" you have to participate in to show you\\'re \\n\"well-rounded,\" the standardized tests as artificial as chess, the \"essay\" you have to write that\\'s \\npresumably meant to hit some very specific target, but you\\'re not told what.\\nAs well as being bad in what it does to kids, this test is also bad in the sense of being very \\nhackable.

Although the \\npopular story is that the way to get into a good college is to be really smart, admissions officers \\nat elite colleges neither are, nor claim to be, looking only for that. What are they looking for? \\nThey're looking for people who are not simply smart, but admirable in some more general \\nsense. And how is this more general admirableness measured? The admissions officers feel it. \\nIn other words, they accept who they like.\\nSo what college admissions is a test of is whether you suit the taste of some group of people. \\nWell, of course a test like that is going to be hackable.

That's why it distorts your life \\nso much for so long.\\nIt's no wonder high school students often feel alienated. The shape of their lives is completely \\nartificial.\\nBut wasting your time is not the worst thing the educational system does to you. The worst thing \\nit does is to train you that the way to win is by hacking bad tests. This is a much subtler problem \\nthat I didn't recognize until I saw it happening to other people.\\nWhen I started advising startup founders at Y Combinator, especially young ones, I was \\npuzzled by the way they always seemed to make things overcomplicated.

Ideally in revenue, but failing that in usage. What they needed to do was get lots \\nof users.\\nHow does one get lots of users? They had all kinds of ideas about that.

They just seemed blind to what was right in front of them.\\nWhy, I would ask myself, do they always make things so complicated?

And not \\njust them, but me! I'd been trained to hack bad tests too, and hadn't realized it till decades later.\\nI had lived as if I realized it, but without knowing why.

Instead of looking at all the \\ndifferent kinds of work people do and thinking of them vaguely as more or less appealing, you \\ncan now ask a very specific question that will sort them in an interesting way: to what extent do \\nyou win at this kind of work by hacking bad tests?\\nIt would help if there was a way to recognize bad tests quickly. Is there a pattern here?

The kinds of work where you win by hacking bad tests will be starved of talent, and the \\nkinds where you win by doing good work will see an influx of the most ambitious people. And as \\nhacking bad tests shrinks in importance, education will evolve to stop training us to do it. \\nImagine what the world could look like if that happened.\\nThis is not just a lesson for individuals to unlearn, but one for society to unlearn, and we'll be \\namazed at the energy that's liberated when we do.\\nNotes:\\n[1] If using tests only to measure learning sounds impossibly utopian, that is already the way things work at Lambda \\nSchool.

There are people who collect old bus tickets. Like many collectors, \\nthey have an obsessive interest in the minutiae of what they collect. They can keep track of \\ndistinctions between different types of bus tickets that would be hard for the rest of us to \\nremember. Because we don't care enough.

One of the most striking features of Darwin\\'s \\nbook about his voyage on the Beagle is the sheer depth of his interest in natural history. His \\ncuriosity seems infinite. Ditto for Ramanujan, sitting by the hour working out on his slate what \\nhappens to series.\\nIt\\'s a mistake to think they were \"laying the groundwork\" for the discoveries they made later. \\nThere\\'s too much intention in that metaphor.

Less than you might think. An obsessive \\ninterest in a topic is both a proxy for ability and a substitute for determination. Unless you have \\nsufficient mathematical aptitude, you won't find series interesting. And when you're obsessively \\ninterested in something, you don't need as much determination: you don't need to push yourself \\nas hard when curiosity is pulling you.\\nAn obsessive interest will even bring you luck, to the extent anything can.

Not just because \\nit's a filter for earnestness, but because it helps you discover new ideas.\\nThe paths that lead to new ideas tend to look unpromising. If they looked promising, other \\npeople would already have explored them. How do the people who do great work discover \\nthese paths that others overlook? The popular story is that they simply have better vision: \\nbecause they're so talented, they see paths that others miss. But if you look at the way great \\ndiscoveries are made, that's not what happens. Darwin didn't pay closer attention to individual \\nspecies than other people because he saw that this would lead to great discoveries, and they \\ndidn't.

They didn't discover the hidden paths that \\nthey did because they seemed promising, but because they couldn't help it. That's what allowed \\nthem to follow paths that someone who was merely ambitious would have ignored.\\nWhat rational person would decide that the way to write great novels was to begin by spending \\nseveral years creating an imaginary elvish language, like Tolkien, or visiting every household in \\nsouthwestern Britain, like Trollope? No one, including Tolkien and Trollope.\\nThe bus ticket theory is similar to Carlyle's famous definition of genius as an infinite capacity for \\ntaking pains. But there are two differences.

But there are two differences. The bus ticket theory makes it clear that the source \\nof this infinite capacity for taking pains is not infinite diligence, as Carlyle seems to have meant, \\nbut the sort of infinite interest that collectors have. It also adds an important qualification: an \\ninfinite capacity for taking pains about something that matters.\\nSo what matters? You can never be sure. It's precisely because no one can tell in advance \\nwhich paths are promising that you can discover new ideas by working on what you're \\ninterested in.\\nBut there are some heuristics you can use to guess whether an obsession might be one that \\nmatters. For example, it's more promising if you're creating something, rather than just \\nconsuming something someone else creates. It's more promising if something you're interested \\nin is difficult, especially if it's more difficult for other people than it is for you. And the obsessions \\nof talented\", \"ething someone else creates. It's more promising if something you're interested \\nin is difficult, especially if it's more difficult for other people than it is for you. And the obsessions \\nof talented people are more likely to be promising. When talented people become interested in \\nrandom things, they're not truly random.\\nBut you can never be sure. In fact, here's an interesting idea that's also rather alarming if it's \\ntrue: it may be that to do great work, you also have to waste a lot of time.\\nIn many different areas, reward is proportionate to risk. If that rule holds here, then the way to \\nfind paths that lead to truly great work is to be willing to expend a lot of effort on things that turn \\nout to be every bit as unpromising as they seem.\\nI'm not sure if this is true. On one hand, it seems surprisingly difficult to waste your time so long \\nas you're working hard on something interesting. So much of what you do ends up being useful. \\nBut on the other hand, the rule about the rela\", \"t seems surprisingly difficult to waste your time so long \\nas you're working hard on something interesting. So much of what you do ends up being useful. \\nBut on the other hand, the rule about the relationship between risk and reward is so powerful \\nthat it seems to hold wherever risk occurs. Newton's case, at least, suggests that the risk/\\nreward rule holds here. He's famous for one particular obsession of his that turned out to be \\nunprecedentedly fruitful: using math to describe the world. But he had two other obsessions, \\nalchemy and theology, that seem to have been complete wastes of time. He ended up net \\nahead. His bet on what we now call physics paid off so well that it more than compensated for \\nthe other two. But were the other two necessary, in the sense that he had to take big risks to \\nmake such big discoveries? I don't know.\\nHere's an even more alarming idea: might one make all bad bets?

I don't know.\\nHere's an even more alarming idea: might one make all bad bets? It probably happens quite \\noften. But we don't know how often, because these people don't become famous.\\nIt's not merely that the returns from following a path are hard to predict. They change \\ndramatically over time. 1830 was a really good time to be obsessively interested in natural \\nhistory. If Darwin had been born in 1709 instead of 1809, we might never have heard of him.\\nWhat can one do in the face of such uncertainty? One solution is to hedge your bets, which in \\nthis case means to follow the obviously promising paths instead of your own private obsessions. \\nBut as with any hedge, you're decreasing reward when you decrease risk. If you forgo working \\non what you like in order to follow some more conventionally ambitious path, you might miss \\nsomething wonderful that you'd otherwise have discovered. That too must happen all the time, \\nperhaps even more often than the g\", \"rder to follow some more conventionally ambitious path, you might miss \\nsomething wonderful that you'd otherwise have discovered. That too must happen all the time, \\nperhaps even more often than the genius whose bets all fail.\\nThe other solution is to let yourself be interested in lots of different things. You don't decrease \\nyour upside if you switch between equally genuine interests based on which seems to be \\nworking so far. But there is a danger here too: if you work on too many different projects, you \\nmight not get deeply enough into any of them.\\nOne interesting thing about the bus ticket theory is that it may help explain why different types \\nof people excel at different kinds of work. Interest is much more unevenly distributed than ability. \\nIf natural ability is all you need to do great work, and natural ability is evenly distributed, you \\nhave to invent elaborate theories to explain the skewed distributions we see among those who \\nactually do great work in various fields. But\", \" great work, and natural ability is evenly distributed, you \\nhave to invent elaborate theories to explain the skewed distributions we see among those who \\nactually do great work in various fields. But it may be that much of the skew has a simpler \\nexplanation: different people are interested in different things.\\nThe bus ticket theory also explains why people are less likely to do great work after they have \\nchildren. Here interest has to compete not just with external obstacles, but with another interest, \\nand one that for most people is extremely powerful. It's harder to find time for work after you \\nhave kids, but that's the easy part. The real change is that you don't want to.\\nBut the most exciting implication of the bus ticket theory is that it suggests ways to encourage \\ngreat work. If the recipe for genius is simply natural ability plus hard work, all we can do is hope \\nwe have a lot of ability, and work as hard as we can. But if interest is a critical ingredient in \\ngenius, we m\", \"f the recipe for genius is simply natural ability plus hard work, all we can do is hope \\nwe have a lot of ability, and work as hard as we can. But if interest is a critical ingredient in \\ngenius, we may be able, by cultivating interest, to cultivate genius.\\nFor example, for the very ambitious, the bus ticket theory suggests that the way to do great \\nwork is to relax a little.

I und', ' not all, because as I say in the talk, Pittsburgh has some important advantages over most \\nwould-be startup hubs.)\\nWhat would it take to make Pittsburgh into a startup hub, like Silicon Valley? I understand \\nPittsburgh pretty well, because I grew up here, in Monroeville. And I understand Silicon Valley \\npretty well because that\\'s where I live now. Could you get that kind of startup ecosystem going \\nhere?\\nWhen I agreed to speak here, I didn\\'t think I\\'d be able to give a very optimistic talk. I thought I\\'d \\nbe talking about what Pittsburgh could do to become a startup hub, very much in the \\nsubjunctive. Instead I\\'m going to talk about what Pittsburgh can do.\\nWhat changed my mind was an article I read in, of all places, the New York Times food section. \\nThe title was \"Pittsburgh\\'s Youth-Driven Food Boom.\" To most people that might not even sound \\ninteresting, let alone something related to startups. But it was electrifying to me to read that title. \\nI don\\'t think I could pick a more prom', 'en Food Boom.\" To most people that might not even sound \\ninteresting, let alone something related to startups. But it was electrifying to me to read that title. \\nI don\\'t think I could pick a more promising one if I tried. And when I read the article I got even \\nmore excited. It said \"people ages 25 to 29 now make up 7.6 percent of all residents, up from 7 \\npercent about a decade ago.\" Wow, I thought, Pittsburgh could be the next Portland. It could \\nbecome the cool place all the people in their twenties want to go live.\\nWhen I got here a couple days ago, I could feel the difference. I lived here from 1968 to 1984. I \\ndidn\\'t realize it at the time, but during that whole period the city was in free fall. On top of the \\nflight to the suburbs that happened everywhere, the steel and nuclear businesses were both \\ndying. Boy are things different now. It\\'s not just that downtown seems a lot more prosperous. \\nThere is an energy here that was not here when I was a kid.\\nWhen I was a kid, this was ', \"nesses were both \\ndying. Boy are things different now. It's not just that downtown seems a lot more prosperous. \\nThere is an energy here that was not here when I was a kid.\\nWhen I was a kid, this was a place young people left. Now it's a place that attracts them.\\nWhat does that have to do with startups? Startups are made of people, and the average age of \\nthe people in a typical startup is right in that 25 to 29 bracket.\\nI've seen how powerful it is for a city to have those people. Five years ago they shifted the \\ncenter of gravity of Silicon Valley from the peninsula to San Francisco. Google and Facebook \\nare on the peninsula, but the next generation of big winners are all in SF. The reason the center \\nof gravity shifted was the talent war, for programmers especially. Most 25 to 29 year olds want \\nto live in the city, not down in the boring suburbs. So whether they like it or not, founders know \\nthey have to be in the city. I know multiple founders who would have preferred to live dow\", 'lds want \\nto live in the city, not down in the boring suburbs. So whether they like it or not, founders know \\nthey have to be in the city. I know multiple founders who would have preferred to live down in \\nthe Valley proper, but who made themselves move to SF because they knew otherwise they\\'d \\nlose the talent war.\\nSo being a magnet for people in their twenties is a very promising thing to be. It\\'s hard to \\nimagine a place becoming a startup hub without also being that. When I read that statistic \\nabout the increasing percentage of 25 to 29 year olds, I had exactly the same feeling of \\nexcitement I get when I see a startup\\'s graphs start to creep upward off the x axis.\\nNationally the percentage of 25 to 29 year olds is 6.8%. That means you\\'re .8% ahead. The \\npopulation is 306,000, so we\\'re talking about a surplus of about 2500 people. That\\'s the \\npopulation of a small town, and that\\'s just the surplus. So you have a toehold. Now you just \\nhave to expand it.\\nAnd though \"youth-driven foo', ' talking about a surplus of about 2500 people. That\\'s the \\npopulation of a small town, and that\\'s just the surplus. So you have a toehold. Now you just \\nhave to expand it.\\nAnd though \"youth-driven food boom\" may sound frivolous, it is anything but. Restaurants and \\ncafes are a big part of the personality of a city. Imagine walking down a street in Paris. What are \\nyou walking past? Little restaurants and cafes. Imagine driving through some depressing \\nrandom exurb. What are you driving past? Starbucks and McDonalds and Pizza Hut. As \\nGertrude Stein said, there is no there there. You could be anywhere.\\nThese independent restaurants and cafes are not just feeding people. They\\'re making there be \\na there here.\\nSo here is my first concrete recommendation for turning Pittsburgh into the next Silicon Valley: \\ndo everything you can to encourage this youth-driven food boom. What could the city do?

What could the city do? Treat \\nthe people starting these little restaurants and cafes as your users, and go ask them what they \\nwant. I can guess at least one thing they might want: a fast permit process. San Francisco has \\nleft you a huge amount of room to beat them in that department.\\nI know restaurants aren\\'t the prime mover though. The prime mover, as the Times article said, \\nis cheap housing. That\\'s a big advantage. But that phrase \"cheap housing\" is a bit misleading. \\nThere are plenty of places that are cheaper. What\\'s special about Pittsburgh is not that it\\'s \\ncheap, but that it\\'s a cheap place you\\'d actually want to live.\\nPart of that is the buildings themselves. I realized a long time ago, back when I was a poor \\ntwenty-something myself, that the best deals were places that had once been rich, and then \\nbecame poor. If a place has always been rich, it\\'s nice but too expensive. If a place has always ', \"as a poor \\ntwenty-something myself, that the best deals were places that had once been rich, and then \\nbecame poor. If a place has always been rich, it's nice but too expensive. If a place has always \\nbeen poor, it's cheap but grim. But if a place was once rich and then got poor, you can find \\npalaces for cheap. And that's what's bringing people here. When Pittsburgh was rich, a hundred \\nyears ago, the people who lived here built big solid buildings. Not always in the best taste, but \\ndefinitely solid. So here is another piece of advice for becoming a startup hub: don't destroy the \\nbuildings that are bringing people here. When cities are on the way back up, like Pittsburgh is \\nnow, developers race to tear down the old buildings. Don't let that happen. Focus on historic \\npreservation. Big real estate development projects are not what's bringing the twenty-\\nsomethings here. They're the opposite of the new restaurants and cafes; they subtract \\npersonality from the city.\\nThe empirical evi\", \"real estate development projects are not what's bringing the twenty-\\nsomethings here.

The \\ntougher cities are about it, the better they seem to do.\\nBut the appeal of Pittsburgh is not just the buildings themselves. It's the neighborhoods they're \\nin. Like San Francisco and New York, Pittsburgh is fortunate in being a pre-car city. It's not too \\nspread out. Because those 25 to 29 year olds do not like driving. They prefer walking, or \\nbicycling, or taking public transport. If you've been to San Francisco recently you can't help \\nnoticing the huge number of bicyclists. And this is not just a fad that the twenty-somethings \\nhave adopted. In this respect they have discovered a better way to live. The beards will go, but \\nnot the bikes.

As with historic preservation, it seems \\nimpossible to go too far.\\nWhy not make Pittsburgh the most bicycle and pedestrian friendly city in the country? See if \\nyou can go so far that you make San Francisco seem backward by comparison. If you do, it\\'s \\nvery unlikely you\\'ll regret it. The city will seem like a paradise to the young people you want to \\nattract. If they do leave to get jobs elsewhere, it will be with regret at leaving behind such a \\nplace. And what\\'s the downside? Can you imagine a headline \"City ruined by becoming too \\nbicycle-friendly?\" It just doesn\\'t happen.\\nSo suppose cool old neighborhoods and cool little restaurants make this the next Portland.

Will \\nthat be enough? It will put you in a way better position than Portland itself, because Pittsburgh \\nhas something Portland lacks: a first-rate research university. CMU plus little cafes means you \\nhave more than hipsters drinking lattes. It means you have hipsters drinking lattes while talking \\nabout distributed systems. Now you\\'re getting really close to San Francisco.\\nIn fact you\\'re better off than San Francisco in one way, because CMU is downtown, but Stanford \\nand Berkeley are out in the suburbs.\\nWhat can CMU do to help Pittsburgh become a startup hub? Be an even better research \\nuniversity. CMU is one of the best universities in the world, but imagine what things would be \\nlike if it were the very best, and everyone knew it. There are a lot of ambitious people who must \\ngo to the best place, wherever it is.

There are a lot of ambitious people who must \\ngo to the best place, wherever it is. If CMU were it, they would all come here. There would be \\nkids in Kazakhstan dreaming of one day living in Pittsburgh.\\nBeing that kind of talent magnet is the most important contribution universities can make toward \\nmaking their city a startup hub. In fact it is practically the only contribution they can make.\\nBut wait, shouldn\\'t universities be setting up programs with words like \"innovation\" and \\n\"entrepreneurship\" in their names? No, they should not. These kind of things almost always turn \\nout to be disappointments. They\\'re pursuing the wrong targets. The way to get innovation is not \\nto aim for innovation but to aim for something more specific, like better batteries or better 3D \\nprinting.

It\\'s like telling people who want to lose weight \\nthat the way to do it is to eat less.\\nBut if you want to know where startups come from, look at the empirical evidence. Look at the \\nhistories of the most successful startups, and you\\'ll find they grow organically out of a couple of \\nfounders building something that starts as an interesting side project. Universities are great at \\nbringing together founders, but beyond that the best thing they can do is get out of the way. For \\nexample, by not claiming ownership of \"intellectual property\" that students and faculty develop, \\nand by having liberal rules about deferred admission and leaves of absence.\\nIn fact, one of the most effective things', ' claiming ownership of \"intellectual property\" that students and faculty develop, \\nand by having liberal rules about deferred admission and leaves of absence.\\nIn fact, one of the most effective things a university could do to encourage startups is an \\nelaborate form of getting out of the way invented by Harvard. Harvard used to have exams for \\nthe fall semester after Christmas. At the beginning of January they had something called \\n\"Reading Period\" when you were supposed to be studying for exams. And Microsoft and \\nFacebook have something in common that few people realize: they were both started during \\nReading Period. It\\'s the perfect situation for producing the sort of side projects that turn into \\nstartups. The students are all on campus, but they don\\'t have to do anything because they\\'re \\nsupposed to be studying for exams.\\nHarvard may have closed this window, because a few years ago they moved exams before \\nChristmas and shortened reading period from 11 days to 7. But if a universi', \"re \\nsupposed to be studying for exams.\\nHarvard may have closed this window, because a few years ago they moved exams before \\nChristmas and shortened reading period from 11 days to 7. But if a university really wanted to \\nhelp its students start startups, the empirical evidence, weighted by market cap, suggests the \\nbest thing they can do is literally nothing.\\nThe culture of Pittsburgh is another of its strengths. It seems like a city has to be socially liberal \\nto be a startup hub, and it's pretty clear why. A city has to tolerate strangeness to be a home for \\nstartups, because startups are so strange. And you can't choose to allow just the forms of \\nstrangeness that will turn into big startups, because they're all intermingled. You have to \\ntolerate all strangeness.\\nThat immediately rules out big chunks of the US. I'm optimistic it doesn't rule out Pittsburgh. \\nOne of the things I remember from growing up here, though I didn't realize at the time that there \\nwas anything unusual about\", \" out big chunks of the US. I'm optimistic it doesn't rule out Pittsburgh. \\nOne of the things I remember from growing up here, though I didn't realize at the time that there \\nwas anything unusual about it, is how well people got along. I'm still not sure why. Maybe one \\nreason was that everyone felt like an immigrant. When I was a kid in Monroeville, people didn't \\ncall themselves American. They called themselves Italian or Serbian or Ukranian. Just imagine \\nwhat it must have been like here a hundred years ago, when people were pouring in from \\ntwenty different countries. Tolerance was the only option.\\nWhat I remember about the culture of Pittsburgh is that it was both tolerant and pragmatic. \\nThat's how I'd describe the culture of Silicon Valley too. And it's not a coincidence, because \\nPittsburgh was the Silicon Valley of its time. This was a city where people built new things.

And more generally to tolerate strangeness, even unto the degree \\nwacko Californians do. For Pittsburgh that is a conservative choice: it's a return to the city's \\nroots.\\nUnfortunately I saved the toughest part for last. There is one more thing you need to be a \\nstartup hub, and Pittsburgh hasn't got it: investors. Silicon Valley has a big investor community \\nbecause it's had 50 years to grow one. New York has a big investor community because it's full \\nof people who like money a lot and are quick to notice new ways to get it. But Pittsburgh has \\nneither of these.

But Pittsburgh has \\nneither of these. And the cheap housing that draws other people here has no effect on investors.\\nIf an investor community grows up here, it will happen the same way it did in Silicon Valley: \\nslowly and organically. So I would not bet on having a big investor community in the short term. \\nBut fortunately there are three trends that make that less necessary than it used to be. One is \\nthat startups are increasingly cheap to start, so you just don't need as much outside money as \\nyou used to. The second is that thanks to things like Kickstarter, a startup can get to revenue \\nfaster. You can put something on Kickstarter from anywhere. The third is programs like Y \\nCombinator. A startup from anywhere in the world can go to YC for 3 months, pick up funding, \\nand then return home if they want.\\nMy advice is to make Pittsburgh a great place for startups, and gradually more of them will stick. \\nSome of those will succee\", \"o to YC for 3 months, pick up funding, \\nand then return home if they want.\\nMy advice is to make Pittsburgh a great place for startups, and gradually more of them will stick. \\nSome of those will succeed; some of their founders will become investors; and still more \\nstartups will stick.\\nThis is not a fast path to becoming a startup hub. But it is at least a path, which is something \\nfew other cities have. And it's not as if you have to make painful sacrifices in the meantime. \\nThink about what I've suggested you should do.

And in particular, \\nthe rich have gotten a lot richer. Nearly everyone who writes about the topic says that economic \\ninequality should be decreased.\\nI'm interested in this question because I was one of the founders of a company called Y \\nCombinator that helps people start startups. Almost by definition, if a startup succeeds, its \\nfounders become rich. Which means by helping startup founders I've been helping to increase \\neconomic inequality. If economic inequality should be decreased, I shouldn't be helping \\nfounders. No one should be.\\nBut that doesn't sound right. What's going on here? What's going on is that while economic \\ninequality is a single measure (or more precisely, two: variation in income, and variation in \\nwealth), it has multiple causes.

And yet the trend in nearly \\neverything written about the subject is to do the opposite: to squash together all the aspects of \\neconomic inequality as if it were a single phenomenon.\\nSometimes this is done for ideological reasons. Sometimes it's because the writer only has very \\nhigh-level data and so draws conclusions from that, like the proverbial drunk who looks for his \\nkeys under the lamppost, instead of where he dropped them, because the light is better there. \\nSometimes it's because the writer doesn't understand critical aspects of ine\", \"ial drunk who looks for his \\nkeys under the lamppost, instead of where he dropped them, because the light is better there. \\nSometimes it's because the writer doesn't understand critical aspects of inequality, like the role \\nof technology in wealth creation. Much of the time, perhaps most of the time, writing about \\neconomic inequality combines all three.\\n___\\nThe most common mistake people make about economic inequality is to treat it as a single \\nphenomenon. The most naive version of which is the one based on the pie fallacy: that the rich \\nget rich by taking money from the poor.\\nUsually this is an assumption people start from rather than a conclusion they arrive at by \\nexamining the evidence. Sometimes the pie fallacy is stated explicitly: ...those at the top are \\ngrabbing an increasing fraction of the nation's income — so much of a larger share that what's \\nleft over for the rest is diminished....

To kids, wealth is a fixed pie that's shared out, and if one person gets more, it's at the \\nexpense of another. It takes a conscious effort to remind oneself that the real world doesn't \\nwork that way.\\nIn the real world you can create wealth as well as taking it from others. A woodworker creates \\nwealth. He makes a chair, and you willingly give him money in return for it. A high-frequency \\ntrader does not. He makes a dollar only when someone on the other end of a trade loses a \\ndollar.\\nIf the rich people in a society got that way by taking wealth from the poor, then you have the \\ndegenerate case of economic inequality, where the cause of poverty is the same as the cause \\nof wealth.

But instances of inequality don't have to be instances of the degenerate case. If one \\nwoodworker makes 5 chairs and another makes none, the second woodworker will have less \\nmoney, but not because anyone took anything from him.\\nEven people sophisticated enough to know about the pie fallacy are led toward it by the custom \\nof describing economic inequality as a ratio of one quantile's income or wealth to another's. It's \\nso easy to slip from talking about income shifting from one quantile to another, as a figure of \\nspeech, into believing that is literally what's happening.\\nExcept in the degenerate case, economic inequality can't be described by a ratio or even a \\ncurve.

This is one way I know the rich aren't all getting richer \\nsimply from some new system for transferring wealth to them from everyone else. When you \\nuse the would-have method with startup founders, you find what most would have done back in \\n1960, when economic inequality was lower, was to join big companies or become professors. \\nBefore Mark Zuckerberg started Facebook, his default expectation was that he'd end up \\nworking at Microsoft.

The reason he and most other startup founders are richer than they would \\nhave been in the mid 20th century is not because of some right turn the country took during the \\nReagan administration, but because progress in technology has made it much easier to start a \\nnew company that grows fast.\\nTraditional economists seem strangely averse to studying individual humans. It seems to be a \\nrule with them that everything has to start with statistics. So they give you very precise numbers \\nabout variation in wealth and income, then follow it with the most naive speculation about the \\nunderlying causes.\\nBut while there are a lot of people who get rich through rent-seeking of various forms, and a lot \\nwho get rich by playing zero-sum games, there are also a significant number who get rich by \\ncreating wealth.

The other reason \\ncreating wealth is such a tenacious source of inequality is that it can expand to accommodate a \\nlot of people.\\n___\\nI'm all for shutting down the crooked ways to get rich. But that won't eliminate great variations in \\nwealth, because as long as you leave open the option of getting rich by creating wealth, people \\nwho want to get rich will do that instead.\\nMost people who get rich tend to be fairly driven.

The reason they go into finance is not because \\nthey love finance but because they want to get rich. If the only way left to get rich is to start \\nstartups, they'll start startups. They'll do well at it too, because determination is the main factor \\nin the success of a startup. [3] And while it would probably be a good thing for the world if \\npeople who wanted to get rich switched from playing zero-sum games to creating wealth, that \\nwould not only not eliminate great variations in wealth, but might even exacerbate them.

Plus it will have a large Baumol penumbra around it: anyone who could get rich by \\ncreating wealth on their own account will have to be paid enough to prevent them from doing it.\\nYou can't prevent great variations in wealth without preventing people from getting rich, and you \\ncan't do that without preventing them from starting startups.\\nSo let's be clear about that.

So if you \\nmade it impossible to get rich by creating wealth in your country, people who wanted to do that \\nwould just leave and do it somewhere else. Which would certainly get you a lower Gini \\ncoefficient, along with a lesson in being careful what you ask for. [4]\\nI think rising economic inequality is the inevitable fate of countries that don't choose something \\nworse.

[5]\\nAnd while some of the growth in economic inequality we've seen since then has been due to \\nbad behavior of various kinds, there has simultaneously been a huge increase in individuals' \\nability to create wealth. Startups are almost entirely a product of this period. And even within the \\nstartup world, there has been a qualitative change in the last 10 years.

The \\nacceleration of productivity we see in Silicon Valley has been happening for thousands of years. \\nIf you look at the history of stone tools, technology was already accelerating in the Mesolithic. \\nThe acceleration would have been too slow to perceive in one lifetime. Such is the nature of the \\nleftmost part of an exponential curve. But it was the same curve.\\nYou do not want to design your society in a way that\\'s incompatible with this curve.

Ignoring any trend that has been operating for thousands of years is \\ndangerous. But exponential growth, especially, tends to bite you.\\n___\\nIf accelerating variation in productivity is always going to produce some baseline growth in \\neconomic inequality, it would be a good idea to spend some time thinking about that future. Can \\nyou have a healthy society with great variation in wealth? What would it look like?\\nNotice how novel it feels to think about that.

It's harder to hide wrongdoing now. And to get rich now you don't have to buy \\npoliticians the way railroad or oil magnates did. [6] The great concentrations of wealth I see \\naround me in Silicon Valley don't seem to be destroying democracy.\\nThere are lots of things wrong with the US that have economic inequality as a symptom. We \\nshould fix those things. In the process we may decrease economic inequality. But we can't start \\nfrom the symptom and hope to fix the underlying causes. [7]\\nThe most obvious is poverty.

[8] Indeed, a good number are merely \\nbeing sloppy by speaking of decreasing economic inequality when what they mean is \\ndecreasing poverty. But this is a situation where it would be good to be precise about what we \\nwant. Poverty and economic inequality are not identical. When the city is turning off your water \\nbecause you can't pay the bill, it doesn't make any difference what Larry Page's net worth is \\ncompared to yours. He might only be a few times richer than you, and it would still be just as \\nmuch of a problem that your water was getting turned off.\\nClosely related to poverty is lack of social mobility.

I\\'ve seen this myself: you don\\'t have to grow \\nup rich or even upper middle class to get rich as a startup founder, but few successful founders \\ngrew up desperately poor. But again, the problem here is not simply economic inequality. There \\nis an enormous difference in wealth between the household Larry Page grew up in and that of a \\nsuccessful startup founder, but that didn\\'t prevent him from joining their ranks. It\\'s not economic \\ninequality per se that\\'s blocking social mobility, but some specific combination of things that go \\nwrong when kids grow up sufficiently poor.\\nOne of the most important principles in Silicon Valley is that \"you make what you measure.\" It \\nmeans that if you pick some number to focus on, it will tend to improve, but that you have to \\nchoose the right number, because only the one you choose will improve; another that seems \\nconceptually adjacent might not. For example, if you\\'re a university president and you decide to \\nfocus on graduation rates, then you', \" because only the one you choose will improve; another that seems \\nconceptually adjacent might not.

Students could learn less, if to improve graduation rates you made \\nclasses easier.\\nEconomic inequality is sufficiently far from identical with the various problems that have it as a \\nsymptom that we'll probably only hit whichever of the two we aim at. If we aim at economic \\ninequality, we won't fix these problems. So I say let's aim at the problems.\\nFor example, let's attack poverty, and if necessary damage wealth in the process. That's much \\nmore likely to work than attacking wealth in the hope that you will thereby fix poverty.

But behind a broad \\nstatistical measure like economic inequality there are some things that are good and some that \\nare bad, some that are historical trends with immense momentum and others that are random \\naccidents.

But in \\nmost if not all, economic inequality is not the primary cause. There is usually some injustice that is allowing economic \\ninequality to turn into other forms of inequality, and that injustice is what we need to fix. For example, the police in the \\nUS treat the poor worse than the rich. But the solution is not to make people richer. It's to make the police treat \\npeople more equitably. Otherwise they'll continue to maltreat people who are weak in other ways.\\n[8] Some who read this essay will say that I'm clueless or even being deliberately misleading by focusing so much on \\nthe richer end of economic inequality — that economic inequality is\", \"in other ways.\\n[8] Some who read this essay will say that I'm clueless or even being deliberately misleading by focusing so much on \\nthe richer end of economic inequality — that economic inequality is really about poverty.

The real problem is poverty, not economic inequality. \\nAnd if you conflate them you're aiming at the wrong target.\\nOthers will say I'm clueless or being misleading by focusing on people who get rich by creating wealth — that \\nstartups aren't the problem, but corrupt practices in finance, healthcare, and so on. Once again, that is exactly my \\npoint. The problem is not economic inequality, but those specific abuses.\\nIt's a strange task to write an essay about why something isn't the problem, but that's the situation you find yourself in \\nwhen so many people mistakenly think it is.\\n[9] Particularly since many causes of poverty are only partially driven by people trying to make m\", \"e problem, but that's the situation you find yourself in \\nwhen so many people mistakenly think it is.\\n[9] Particularly since many causes of poverty are only partially driven by people trying to make money from them.

The golden age of economic equality in the mid 20th century was also the golden age of tax avoidance. \\nIndeed, it was so widespread and so effective that I'm skeptical whether economic inequality was really so low then \\nas we think.

Few \\nadults aspired to look dangerous in 1950.\\nBut the rise of national corporations didn't just compress us culturally. It compressed us \\neconomically too, and on both ends.\\nAlong with giant national corporations, we got giant national labor unions. And in the mid 20th \\ncentury the corporations cut deals with the unions where they paid over market price for labor. \\nPartly because the unions were monopolies.

Just as \\nstartups rightly pay AWS a premium over the cost of running their own servers so they can \\nfocus on growth, many of the big national corporations were willing to pay a premium for labor. \\n[11]\\nAs well as pushing incomes up from the bottom, by overpaying unions, the big companies of \\nthe 20th century also pushed incomes down at the top, by underpaying their top management. \\nEconomist J.

Much of the de facto pay of executives never showed up on \\ntheir income tax returns, because it took the form of perks. The higher the rate of income tax, \\nthe more pressure there was to pay employees upstream of it. (In the UK, where taxes were \\neven higher than in the US, companies would even pay their kids\\' private school tuitions.) One \\nof the most valuable things the big companies of the mid 20th century gave their employees \\nwas job security, and this too didn\\'t show up in tax returns or income statistics. So the nature of \\nemployment in these organizations tended to yield falsely low numbers about economic \\ninequality.

If the company promised to employ you till you retired and \\ngive you a pension afterward, you didn't want to extract as much from it this year as you could. \\nYou needed to take care of the company so it could take care of you.

From their point of view, as big company executives, they were \\nhigh-ranking officers. They got paid a lot more than privates. They got to have expense account \\nlunches at the best restaurants and fly around on the company's Gulfstreams. It probably didn't \\noccur to most of them to ask if they were being paid market price.\\nThe ultimate way to get market price is to work for yourself, by starting your own company.

The rewards would come later. What was novel about yuppies \\nwas that they wanted market price for the work they were doing now.\\nThe first yuppies did not work for startups. That was still in the future. Nor did they work for big \\ncompanies. They were professionals working in fields like law, finance, and consulting. But their \\nexample rapidly inspired their peers. Once they saw that new BMW 325i, they wanted one too.\\nUnderpaying people at the beginning of their career only work\", \" like law, finance, and consulting. But their \\nexample rapidly inspired their peers. Once they saw that new BMW 325i, they wanted one too.\\nUnderpaying people at the beginning of their career only works if everyone does it. Once some \\nemployer breaks ranks, everyone else has to, or they can't get good people. And once started \\nthis process spreads through the whole economy, because at the beginnings of people's \\ncareers they can easily switch not merely employers but industries.\\nBut not all young professionals benefitted. You had to produce to get paid a lot. It was no \\ncoincidence that the first yuppies worked in fields where it was easy to measure that.\\nMore generally, an idea was returning whose name sounds old-fashioned precisely because it \\nwas so rare for so long: that you could make your fortune. As in the past there were multiple \\nways to do it. Some made their fortunes by creating wealth, and others by playing zero-sum \\ngames. But once it became possible to make one's fortune, \", \"your fortune. As in the past there were multiple \\nways to do it. Some made their fortunes by creating wealth, and others by playing zero-sum \\ngames. But once it became possible to make one's fortune, the ambitious had to decide \\nwhether or not to. A physicist who chose physics over Wall Street in 1990 was making a \\nsacrifice that a physicist in 1960 didn't have to think about.\\nThe idea even flowed back into big companies. CEOs of big companies make more now than \\nthey used to, and I think much of the reason is prestige. In 1960, corporate CEOs had immense \\nprestige. They were the winners of the only economic game in town. But if they made as little \\nnow as they did then, in real dollar terms, they'd seem like small fry compared to professional \\nathletes and whiz kids making millions from startups and hedge funds. They don't like that idea, \\nso now they try to get as much as they can, which is more than they had been getting. [19]\\nMeanwhile a similar fragmentation was happening at the o\", \"tartups and hedge funds. They don't like that idea, \\nso now they try to get as much as they can, which is more than they had been getting. [19]\\nMeanwhile a similar fragmentation was happening at the other end of the economic scale. As \\nbig companies' oligopolies became less secure, they were less able to pass costs on to \\ncustomers and thus less willing to overpay for labor. And as the Duplo world of a few big blocks \\nfragmented into many companies of different sizes — some of them overseas — it became \\nharder for unions to enforce their monopolies. As a result workers' wages also tended toward \\nmarket price. Which (inevitably, if unions had been doing their job) tended to be lower. Perhaps \\ndramatically so, if automation had decreased the need for some kind of work.\\nAnd just as the mid-century model induced social as well as economic cohesion, its breakup \\nbrought social as well as economic fragmentation. People started to dress and act differently. \\nThose who would later be called th\", 'ntury model induced social as well as economic cohesion, its breakup \\nbrought social as well as economic fragmentation. People started to dress and act differently. \\nThose who would later be called the \"creative class\" became more mobile. People who didn\\'t \\ncare much for religion felt less pressure to go to church for appearances\\' sake, while those who \\nliked it a lot opted for increasingly colorful forms. Some switched from meat loaf to tofu, and \\nothers to Hot Pockets. Some switched from driving Ford sedans to driving small imported cars, \\nand others to driving SUVs. Kids who went to private schools or wished they did started to \\ndress \"preppy,\" and kids who wanted to seem rebellious made a conscious effort to look \\ndisreputable. In a hundred ways people spread apart. [20]\\nAlmost four decades later, fragmentation is still increasing. Has it been net good or bad? I don\\'t \\nknow; the question may be unanswerable. Not entirely bad though. We take for granted the \\nforms of fragmentation w', \"cades later, fragmentation is still increasing. Has it been net good or bad? I don't \\nknow; the question may be unanswerable. Not entirely bad though. We take for granted the \\nforms of fragmentation we like, and worry only about the ones we don't. But as someone who \\ncaught the tail end of mid-century conformism, I can tell you it was no utopia. [21]\\nMy goal here is not to say whether fragmentation has been good or bad, just to explain why it's \\nhappening. With the centripetal forces of total war and 20th century oligopoly mostly gone, what \\nwill happen next? And more specifically, is it possible to reverse some of the fragmentation \\nwe've seen?\\nIf it is, it will have to happen piecemeal. You can't reproduce mid-century cohesion the way it \\nwas originally produced. It would be insane to go to war just to induce more national unity. And \\nonce you understand the degree to which the economic history of the 20th century was a low-\\nres version 1, it's clear you can't reproduce that either.\\n\", \" to war just to induce more national unity. And \\nonce you understand the degree to which the economic history of the 20th century was a low-\\nres version 1, it's clear you can't reproduce that either.\\n20th century cohesion was something that happened at least in a sense naturally. The war was \\ndue mostly to external forces, and the Duplo economy was an evolutionary phase. If you want \\ncohesion now, you'd have to induce it deliberately. And it's not obvious how. I suspect the best \\nwe'll be able to do is address the symptoms of fragmentation. But that may be enough.\\nThe form of fragmentation people worry most about lately is economic inequality, and if you \\nwant to eliminate that you're up against a truly formidable headwind that has been in operation \\nsince the stone age. Technology.\\nTechnology is a lever. It magnifies work. And the lever not only grows increasingly long, but the \\nrate at which it grows is itself increasing.\\nWhich in turn means the variation in the amount of wealth peop\", \"logy is a lever.

The unusual conditions that prevailed in the mid 20th century \\nmasked this underlying trend. The ambitious had little choice but to join large organizations that \\nmade them march in step with lots of other people — literally in the case of the armed forces, \\nfiguratively in the case of big corporations. Even if the big corporations had wanted to pay \\npeople proportionate to their value, they couldn't have figured out how. But that constraint has \\ngone now. Ever since it started to erode in the 1970s, we've seen the underlying forces at work \\nagain. [22]\\nNot everyone who gets rich now does it by creating wealth, certainly.

[23] And as long as it's \\npossible to get rich by creating wealth, the default tendency will be for economic inequality to \\nincrease. Even if you eliminate all the other ways to get rich. You can mitigate this with \\nsubsidies at the bottom and taxes at the top, but unless taxes are high enough to discourage \\npeople from creating wealth, you're always going to be fighting a losing battle against \\nincreasing variation in productivity. [24]\\nThat form of fragmentation, like the others, is here to stay. Or rather, back to stay. Nothing is \\nforever, but the tendency toward fragmentation should be more forever than most things, \\nprecisely because it's not due to any particular cause. It's simply a reversion to the mean.

It\\'s back now, and \\nthat\\'s likely to be true for longer.\\nI worry that if we don\\'t acknowledge this, we\\'re headed for trouble. If we think 20th century \\ncohesion disappeared because of few policy tweaks, we\\'ll be deluded into thinking we can get it \\nback (minus the bad parts, somehow) with a few countertweaks. And then we\\'ll waste our time \\ntrying to eliminate fragmentation, when we\\'d be better off thinking about how to mitigate its \\nconsequences.\\nNotes:\\n[1] Lester Thurow, writing in 1975, said the wage differentials prevailing at the end of World War II had become so \\nembedded that they \"were regarded as \\'just\\' even after the egalitarian pressures of World War II had disappeared. \\nBasically, the same differentials exist to this day, thirty years later.\" But Goldin and Margo think market forces i', 'ed as \\'just\\' even after the egalitarian pressures of World War II had disappeared. \\nBasically, the same differentials exist to this day, thirty years later.\" But Goldin and Margo think market forces in the \\npostwar period also helped preserve the wartime compression of wages — specifically increased demand for \\nunskilled workers, and oversupply of educated ones.\\n(Oddly enough, the American custom of having employers pay for health insurance derives from efforts by \\nbusinesses to circumvent NWLB wage controls in order to attract workers.)\\n[2] As always, tax rates don\\'t tell the whole story.

He devoted much of The New Industrial State to trying to figure this out.\\nHis theory was that professionalism had replaced money as a motive, and that modern corporate executives were, \\nlike (good) scientists, motivated less by financial rewards than by the desire to do good work and thereby earn the \\nrespect of their peers. There is something in this, though I think lack of movement between companies combined with \\nself-interest explains much of observed behavior.\\n[13] Galbraith (p. 94) says a 1952 study of the 800 highest paid executives at 300 big corporations found that three \\nquarters of them had been with their company for more than 20 ', \" observed behavior.\\n[13] Galbraith (p. 94) says a 1952 study of the 800 highest paid executives at 300 big corporations found that three \\nquarters of them had been with their company for more than 20 years.\\n[14] It seems likely that in the first third of the 20th century executive salaries were low partly because companies \\nthen were more dependent on banks, who would have disapproved if executives got too much. This was certainly \\ntrue in the beginning. The first big company CEOs were J. P\\n. Morgan's hired hands.\\nCompanies didn't start to finance themselves with retained earnings till the 1920s.

The overall atmosphere was shockingly different from a VC's office on \\nSand Hill Road, in a way that was entirely for the better. There was an authenticity that \\neveryone who walked in could sense. And that didn't just mean that people trusted us. It was \\nthe perfect quality to instill in startups. Authenticity is one of the most important things YC looks \\nfor in founders, not just because fakers and opportunists are annoying, but because authenticity \\nis one of the main things that separates the most successful startups from the rest.\\nEarly YC was a family, and Jessica was its mom.

Everything we did as an \\norganization went through her first — who to fund, what to say to the public, how to deal with \\nother companies, who to hire, everything.\\nBefore we had kids, YC was more or less our life. There was no real distinction between \\nworking hours and not. We talked about YC all the time. And while there might be some \\nbusinesses that it would be tedious to let infect your private life, we liked it. We'd started YC \\nbecause it was something we were interested in.

One of the \\nthings she's best at is judging people. She's one of those rare individuals with x-ray vision for \\ncharacter. She can see through any kind of faker almost immediately. Her nickname within YC \\nwas the Social Radar, and this special power of hers was critical in making YC what it is. The \\nearlier you pick startups, the more you're picking the founders.

Mostly we had the \\nsame sort of insight Socrates claimed: we at least knew we knew nothing. What made YC \\nsuccessful was being able to pick good founders. We thought Airbnb was a bad idea. We \\nfunded it because we liked the founders.\\nDuring interviews, Robert and Trevor and I would pepper the applicants with technical \\nquestions. Jessica would mostly watch. A lot of the applicants probably read her as some kind \\nof secretary, especially early on, because she was the one who\\'d go out and get each new \\ngroup and she didn\\'t ask many questions. She was ok with that. It was easier for her to watch \\npeople if they didn\\'t notice her.

So we\\'d refuse to fund founders whose characters we had \\ndoubts about even if we thought they\\'d be successful.\\nThough we initially did this out of self-indulgence, it turned out to be very valuable to YC.

The level of trust and helpfulness is remarkable for a group of such size. \\nAnd Jessica is the main reason why.\\n(As we later learned, it probably cost us little to reject people whose characters we had doubts \\nabout, because how good founders are and how well they do are not orthogonal.

Which is exciting because \\namong other things it means third parties can use this technique to detect bias whether those \\ndoing the selecting want them to or not.\\nYou can use this technique whenever (a) you have at least a random sample of the applicants \\nthat were selected, (b) their subsequent performance is measured, and (c) the groups of \\napplicants you're comparing have roughly equal distribution of ability.\\nHow does it work? Think about what it means to be biased. What it means for a selection \\nprocess to be biased against applicants of type x is that it's harder for them to make it through. \\nWhich means applicants of type x have to be better to get selected than applicants not of type \\nx.

And if the performance of all the successful applicants \\nis measured, you'll know if they do.\\nOf course, the test you use to measure performance must be a valid one. And in particular it \\nmust not be invalidated by the bias you're trying to measure. But there are some domains \\nwhere performance can be measured, and in those detecting bias is straightforward. Want to \\nknow if the selection process was biased against some type of applicant? Check whether they \\noutperform the others. This is not just a heuristic for detecting bias.

[2]\\nThe reason I began by saying that this technique would come as a surprise to many people is \\nthat we so rarely see analyses of this type.

They write in a different language \\nthan they\\'d use if they were talking to a friend. The sentence structure and even the words are \\ndifferent. No one uses \"pen\" as a verb in spoken English. You\\'d feel like an idiot using \"pen\" \\ninstead of \"write\" in a conversation with a friend.\\nThe last straw for me was a sentence I read a couple days ago: The mercurial Spaniard himself \\ndeclared: \"After Altamira, all is decadence.\" It\\'s from Neil Oliver\\'s A History of Ancient Britain. I \\nfeel bad making an example of this book, because it', 'ple days ago: The mercurial Spaniard himself \\ndeclared: \"After Altamira, all is decadence.\" It\\'s from Neil Oliver\\'s A History of Ancient Britain. I \\nfeel bad making an example of this book, because it\\'s no worse than lots of others. But just \\nimagine calling Picasso \"the mercurial Spaniard\" when talking to a friend. Even one sentence of \\nthis would raise eyebrows in conversation. And yet people write whole books of it.\\nOk, so written and spoken language are different. Does that make written language worse?\\nIf you want people to read and understand what you write, yes. Written language is more \\ncomplex, which makes it more work to read. It\\'s also more formal and distant, which gives the \\nreader\\'s attention permission to drift. But perhaps worst of all, the complex sentences and fancy \\nwords give you, the writer, the false impression that you\\'re saying more than you actually are.\\nYou don\\'t need complex sentences to express complex ideas. When specialists in some \\nabstruse topic talk to o', \" give you, the writer, the false impression that you're saying more than you actually are.\\nYou don't need complex sentences to express complex ideas. When specialists in some \\nabstruse topic talk to one another about ideas in their field, they don't use sentences any more \\ncomplex than they do when talking about what to have for lunch. They use different words, \\ncertainly. But even those they use no more than necessary. And in my experience, the harder \\nthe subject, the more informally experts speak. Partly, I think, because they have less to prove, \\nand partly because the harder the ideas you're talking about, the less you can afford to let \\nlanguage get in the way.\\nInformal language is the athletic clothing of ideas.\\nI'm not saying spoken language always works best. Poetry is as much music as text, so you can \\nsay things you wouldn't say in conversation. And there are a handful of writers who can get \\naway with using fancy language in prose. And then of course there are cases where w\", 'ic as text, so you can \\nsay things you wouldn\\'t say in conversation. And there are a handful of writers who can get \\naway with using fancy language in prose. And then of course there are cases where writers \\ndon\\'t want to make it easy to understand what they\\'re saying—in corporate announcements of \\nbad news, for example, or at the more bogus end of the humanities. But for nearly everyone \\nelse, spoken language is better.\\nIt seems to be hard for most people to write in spoken language. So perhaps the best solution \\nis to write your first draft the way you usually would, then afterward look at each sentence and \\nask \"Is this the way I\\'d say this if I were talking to a friend?\" If it isn\\'t, imagine what you would \\nsay, and use that instead. After a while this filter will start to operate as you write. When you \\nwrite something you wouldn\\'t say, you\\'ll hear the clank as it hits the page.\\nBefore I publish a new essay, I read it out loud and fix everything that doesn\\'t sound like \\nconversati', \"ou write.

I even fix bits that are phonetically awkward; I don't know if that's necessary, but it \\ndoesn't cost much.\\nThis trick may not always be enough. I've seen writing so far removed from spoken language \\nthat it couldn't be fixed sentence by sentence. For cases like that there's a more drastic solution. \\nAfter writing the first draft, try explaining to a friend what you just wrote. Then replace the draft \\nwith what you said to your friend.\\nPeople often tell me how much my essays sound like me talking. The fact that this seems \\nworthy of comment shows how rarely people manage to write in spoken language. Otherwise \\neveryone's writing would sound like them talking.\\nIf you simply manage to write in spoken language, you'll be ahead of 95% of writers.

Assuming their expenses remain constant and their \\nrevenue growth is what it has been over the last several months, do they make it to profitability \\non the money they have left? Or to put it more dramatically, by default do they live or die?\\nThe startling thing is how often the founders themselves don't know. Half the founders I talk to \\ndon't know whether they're default alive or default dead.\\nIf you're among that number, Trevor Blackwell has made a handy calculator \", \"en the founders themselves don't know. Half the founders I talk to \\ndon't know whether they're default alive or default dead.\\nIf you're among that number, Trevor Blackwell has made a handy calculator you can use to find \\nout.\\nThe reason I want to know first whether a startup is default alive or default dead is that the rest \\nof the conversation depends on the answer. If the company is default alive, we can talk about \\nambitious new things they could do. If it's default dead, we probably need to talk about how to \\nsave it. We know the current trajectory ends badly. How can they get off that trajectory?\\nWhy do so few founders know whether they're default alive or default dead? Mainly, I think, \\nbecause they're not used to asking that. It's not a question that makes sense to ask early on, \\nany more than it makes sense to ask a 3 year old how he plans to support himself. But as the \\ncompany grows older, the question switches from meaningless to critical. That kind of switch \\noften takes pe\", \"y more than it makes sense to ask a 3 year old how he plans to support himself. But as the \\ncompany grows older, the question switches from meaningless to critical. That kind of switch \\noften takes people by surprise.\\nI propose the following solution: instead of starting to ask too late whether you're default alive or \\ndefault dead, start asking too early. It's hard to say precisely when the question switches \\npolarity. But it's probably not that dangerous to start worrying too early that you're default dead, \\nwhereas it's very dangerous to start worrying too late.\\nThe reason is a phenomenon I wrote about earlier: the fatal pinch. The fatal pinch is default \\ndead + slow growth + not enough time to fix it. And the way founders end up in it is by not \\nrealizing that's where they're headed.\\nThere is another reason founders don't ask themselves whether they're default alive or default \\ndead: they assume it will be easy to raise more money. But that assumption is often false, and \\nworse sti\", 'here is another reason founders don\\'t ask themselves whether they\\'re default alive or default \\ndead: they assume it will be easy to raise more money. But that assumption is often false, and \\nworse still, the more you depend on it, the falser it becomes.\\nMaybe it will help to separate facts from hopes. Instead of thinking of the future with vague \\noptimism, explicitly separate the components. Say \"We\\'re default dead, but we\\'re counting on \\ninvestors to save us.\" Maybe as you say that, it will set off the same alarms in your head that it \\ndoes in mine. And if you set off the alarms sufficiently early, you may be able to avoid the fatal \\npinch.\\nIt would be safe to be default dead if you could count on investors saving you. As a rule their \\ninterest is a function of growth. If you have steep revenue growth, say over 5x a year, you can \\nstart to count on investors being interested even if you\\'re not profitable. [1] But investors are so \\nfickle that you can never do more than start to count ', \"evenue growth, say over 5x a year, you can \\nstart to count on investors being interested even if you're not profitable. [1] But investors are so \\nfickle that you can never do more than start to count on them. Sometimes something about your \\nbusiness will spook investors even if your growth is great. So no matter how good your growth \\nis, you can never safely treat fundraising as more than a plan A. You should always have a plan \\nB as well: you should know (as in write down) precisely what you'll need to do to survive if you \\ncan't raise more money, and precisely when you'll have to switch to plan B if plan A isn't working.\\nIn any case, growing fast versus operating cheaply is far from the sharp dichotomy many \\nfounders assume it to be. In practice there is surprisingly little connection between how much a \\nstartup spends and how fast it grows. When a startup grows fast, it's usually because the \\nproduct hits a nerve, in the sense of hitting some big need straight on. When a startup spe\", \"tween how much a \\nstartup spends and how fast it grows. When a startup grows fast, it's usually because the \\nproduct hits a nerve, in the sense of hitting some big need straight on. When a startup spends a \\nlot, it's usually because the product is expensive to develop or sell, or simply because they're \\nwasteful.\\nIf you're paying attention, you'll be asking at this point not just how to avoid the fatal pinch, but \\nhow to avoid being default dead. That one is easy: don't hire too fast. Hiring too fast is by far the \\nbiggest killer of startups that raise money. [2]\\nFounders tell themselves they need to hire in order to grow. But most err on the side of \\noverestimating this need rather than underestimating it. Why? Partly because there's so much \\nwork to do. Naive founders think that if they can just hire enough people, it will all get done. \\nPartly because successful startups have lots of employees, so it seems like that's what one \\ndoes in order to be successful. In fact the large staff\", \"can just hire enough people, it will all get done. \\nPartly because successful startups have lots of employees, so it seems like that's what one \\ndoes in order to be successful. In fact the large staffs of successful startups are probably more \\nthe effect of growth than the cause. And partly because when founders have slow growth they \\ndon't want to face what is usually the real reason: the product is not appealing enough.\\nPlus founders who've just raised money are often encouraged to overhire by the VCs who \\nfunded them. Kill-or-cure strategies are optimal for VCs because they're protected by the \\nportfolio effect. VCs want to blow you up, in one sense of the phrase or the other. But as a \\nfounder your incentives are different. You want above all to survive. [3]\\nHere's a common way startups die. They make something moderately appealing and have \\ndecent initial growth. They raise their first round fairly easily, because the founders seem smart \\nand the idea sounds plausible. But because\", 's die. They make something moderately appealing and have \\ndecent initial growth. They raise their first round fairly easily, because the founders seem smart \\nand the idea sounds plausible. But because the product is only moderately appealing, growth is \\nok but not great. The founders convince themselves that hiring a bunch of people is the way to \\nboost growth. Their investors agree. But (because the product is only moderately appealing) the \\ngrowth never comes. Now they\\'re rapidly running out of runway. They hope further investment \\nwill save them. But because they have high expenses and slow growth, they\\'re now \\nunappealing to investors. They\\'re unable to raise more, and the company dies.\\nWhat the company should have done is address the fundamental problem: that the product is \\nonly moderately appealing. Hiring people is rarely the way to fix that. More often than not it \\nmakes it harder. At this early stage, the product needs to evolve more than to be \"built out,\" and \\nthat\\'s usuall', 'rately appealing. Hiring people is rarely the way to fix that. More often than not it \\nmakes it harder. At this early stage, the product needs to evolve more than to be \"built out,\" and \\nthat\\'s usually easier with fewer people. [4]\\nAsking whether you\\'re default alive or default dead may save you from this. Maybe the alarm \\nbells it sets off will counteract the forces that push you to overhire. Instead you\\'ll be compelled \\nto seek growth in other ways. For example, by doing things that don\\'t scale, or by redesigning \\nthe product in the way only founders can. And for many if not most startups, these paths to \\ngrowth will be the ones that actually work.\\nAirbnb waited 4 months after raising money at the end of Y Combinator before they hired their \\nfirst employee. In the meantime the founders were terribly overworked. But they were \\noverworked evolving Airbnb into the astonishingly successful organism it is now.\\nNotes:\\n[1] Steep usage growth will also interest investors.

Revenue will ultimately be a constant multiple of usage, so x% \\nusage growth predicts x% revenue growth. But in practice investors discount merely predicted revenue, so if you're \\nmeasuring usage you need a higher growth rate to impress investors.\\n[2] Startups that don't raise money are saved from hiring too fast because they can't afford to. But that doesn't mean \\nyou should avoid raising money in order to avoid this problem, any more than that total abstinence is the only way to \\navoid becoming an alcoholic.\\n[3] I would not be surprised if VCs' tendency to push founders to overhire is not even in their own interest.

As I\\'ve written before, one of the things that has surprised \\nme most about startups is how few of the most successful founders are like that. Maybe \\nsuccessful people in other industries are; I don\\'t know; but not startup founders. [1]\\nI knew this empirically, but I never saw the math of why till I got this founder\\'s email. In it he said \\nhe worried that he was fundamentally soft-hearted and tended to give away too much for free. \\nHe tho', 'w this empirically, but I never saw the math of why till I got this founder\\'s email. In it he said \\nhe worried that he was fundamentally soft-hearted and tended to give away too much for free. \\nHe thought perhaps he needed \"a little dose of sociopath-ness.\"\\nI told him not to worry about it, because so long as he built something good enough to spread \\nby word of mouth, he\\'d have a superlinear growth curve. If he was bad at extracting money from \\npeople, at worst this curve would be some constant multiple less than 1 of what it might have \\nbeen. But a constant multiple of any curve is exactly the same shape. The numbers on the Y \\naxis are smaller, but the curve is just as steep, and when anything grows at the rate of a \\nsuccessful startup, the Y axis will take care of itself.\\nSome examples will make this clear. Suppose your company is making $1000 a month now, \\nand you\\'ve made something so great that it\\'s growing at 5% a week. Two years from now, you\\'ll \\nbe making about $160k a month.\\nNo', \"ill make this clear. Suppose your company is making $1000 a month now, \\nand you've made something so great that it's growing at 5% a week. Two years from now, you'll \\nbe making about $160k a month.\\nNow suppose you're so un-rapacious that you only extract half as much from your users as you \\ncould. That means two years later you'll be making $80k a month instead of $160k. How far \\nbehind are you? How long will it take to catch up with where you'd have been if you were \\nextracting every penny? A mere 15 weeks. After two years, the un-rapacious founder is only 3.5 \\nmonths behind the rapacious one. [2]\\nIf you're going to optimize a number, the one to choose is your growth rate. Suppose as before \\nthat you only extract half as much from users as you could, but that you're able to grow 6% a \\nweek instead of 5%. Now how are you doing compared to the rapacious founder after two \\nyears? You're already ahead—$214k a month versus $160k—and pulling away fast. In another \\nyear you'll be making $4.4\", \"k instead of 5%. Now how are you doing compared to the rapacious founder after two \\nyears? You're already ahead—$214k a month versus $160k—and pulling away fast. In another \\nyear you'll be making $4.4 million a month to the rapacious founder's $2 million.\\nObviously one case where it would help to be rapacious is when growth depends on that. What \\nmakes startups different is that usually it doesn't. Startups usually win by making something so \\ngreat that people recommend it to their friends. And being rapacious not only doesn't help you \\ndo that, but probably hurts. [3]\\nThe reason startup founders can safely be nice is that making great things is compounded, and \\nrapacity isn't.\\nSo if you're a founder, here's a deal you can make with yourself that will both make you happy \\nand make your company successful. Tell yourself you can be as nice as you want, so long as \\nyou work hard on your growth rate to compensate. Most successful startups make that tradeoff \\nunconsciously. Maybe if you do \", 'pany successful. Tell yourself you can be as nice as you want, so long as \\nyou work hard on your growth rate to compensate. Most successful startups make that tradeoff \\nunconsciously. Maybe if you do it consciously you\\'ll do it even better.\\nNotes:\\n[1] Many think successful startup founders are driven by money. In fact the secret weapon of the most successful \\nfounders is that they aren\\'t. If they were, they\\'d have taken one of the acquisition offers that every fast-growing \\nstartup gets on the way up.

Unl\", \"s with mobile apps, especially, \\nhaving the right domain name is not as critical as it used to be for getting users. The problem \\nwith not having the .com of your name is that it signals weakness. Unless you're so big that your \\nreputation precedes you, a marginal domain suggests you're a marginal company. Whereas (as \\nStripe shows) having x.com signals strength even if it has no relation to what you do.\\nEven good founders can be in denial about this. Their denial derives from two very powerful \\nforces: identity, and lack of imagination.\\nX is what we are, founders think. There's no other name as good. Both of which are false.\\nYou can fix the first by stepping back from the problem. Imagine you'd called your company \\nsomething else. If you had, surely you'd be just as attached to that name as you are to your \\ncurrent one. The idea of switching to your current name would seem repellent.

The idea of switching to your current name would seem repellent. [1]\\nThere's nothing intrinsically great about your current name. Nearly all your attachment to it \\ncomes from it being attached to you. [2]\\nThe way to neutralize the second source of denial, your inability to think of other potential \\nnames, is to acknowledge that you're bad at naming. Naming is a completely separate skill from \\nthose you need to be a good founder. You can be a great startup founder but hopeless at \\nthinking of names for your company.\\nOnce you acknowledge that, you stop believing there is nothing else you could be called. There \\nare lots of other potential names that are as good or better; you just can't think of them.\\nHow do you find them?

So make a list and try to buy some. That's what Stripe did. (Their \\nsearch also turned up parse.com, which their friends at Parse took.)\\nThe reason I know that naming companies is a distinct skill orthogonal to the others you need \\nin a startup is that I happen to have it.

And certainly the founders of Big \\nCompany won\\'t be offended. If anything they\\'ll think more highly of you. You\\'ll remind them of \\nthemselves.

And they're justified in doing so \\nwith opinions about things that don't change much, like human nature. But you can't trust your \\nopinions in the same way about things that change, which could include practically everything \\nelse.\\nWhen experts are wrong, it's often because they're experts on an earlier version of the world.\\nIs it possible to avoid that?

To some extent, \\nyes. I spent almost a decade investing in early stage startups, and curiously enough protecting \\nyourself against obsolete beliefs is exactly what you have to do to succeed as a startup \\ninvestor. Most really good startup ideas look like bad ideas at first, and many of those look bad \\nspecifically because some change in the world just switched them from bad to good. I spent a \\nlot of time learning to recognize such ideas, and the techniques I used may be applicable to \\nideas in general.\\nThe first step is to have an explicit belief in change. People who fall victim to a monotonically \\nincreasing confidence in their opinions are implicitly concluding the world is static. If you \\nconsciously remind yourself it isn't, you start to look for change.\\nWhere should one look for it?

Beyond the moderately useful generalization that human nature \\ndoesn't change much, the unfortunate fact is that change is hard to predict. This is largely a \\ntautology but worth remembering all the same: change that matters usually comes from an \\nunforeseen quarter.\\nSo I don't even try to predict it. When I get asked in interviews to predict the future, I always \\nhave to struggle to come up with something plausible-sounding on the fly, like a student who \\nhasn't prepared for an exam. [1] But it's not out of laziness that I haven't prepared. It seems to \\nme that beliefs about the future are so rarely correct that they usually aren't worth the extra \\nrigidity they impose, and that the best strategy is simply to be aggressively open-minded. \\nInstead of trying to point yourself in the right direction, admit you have no idea what the right \\ndirection is, and \", \"they impose, and that the best strategy is simply to be aggressively open-minded. \\nInstead of trying to point yourself in the right direction, admit you have no idea what the right \\ndirection is, and try instead to be super sensitive to the winds of change.\\nIt's ok to have working hypotheses, even though they may constrain you a bit, because they \\nalso motivate you. It's exciting to chase things and exciting to try to guess answers. But you \\nhave to be disciplined about not letting your hypotheses harden into anything more. [2]\\nI believe this passive m.o. works not just for evaluating new ideas but also for having them. The \\nway to come up with new ideas is not to try explicitly to, but to try to solve problems and simply \\nnot discount weird hunches you have in the process.\\nThe winds of change originate in the unconscious minds of domain experts.

If they can \\nrealize before other investors that some apparently unpromising startup isn't, they can make a \\nhuge amount of money. But the incentives are more than just financial. Investors' opinions are \\nexplicitly tested: startups come to them and they have to say yes or no, and then, fairly quickly, \\nthey learn whether they guessed right.

[4]\\nAnother trick I've found to protect myself against obsolete beliefs is to focus initially on people \\nrather than ideas. Though the nature of future discoveries is hard to predict, I've found I can \\npredict quite well what sort of people will make them.

It's hard to convince investors the first time \\ntoo, but founders expect that. What bites them the second time is a confluence of three forces: \\nThe company is spending more now than it did the first time it raised money.\\n Investors have much higher standards for companies that have already raised money.\\n The company is now starting to read as a failure.

Founders \\noverestimate their chances of raising more money, and so are slack about reaching profitability, \\nwhich further decreases their chances of raising money.\\nNow that you know about the fatal pinch, how do you avoid it?

The first step is to re-evaluate the probability \\nof raising more money. I will now, by an amazing feat of clairvoyance, do this for you: the \\nprobability is zero.

After all, you're not doing those 15 people any favors if you fly the company \\ninto ground with them aboard. They'll all lose their jobs eventually, along with all the time they \\nexpended on this doomed company.\\nWhereas if you only have a handful of people, it may be better to focus on trying to make more \\nmoney. It may seem facile to suggest a startup make more money, as if that could be done for \\nthe asking. Usually a startup is already trying as hard as it can to sell whatever it sells.

Get funded by Y Combinator. \\n October 2014\\n(This essay is derived from a guest lecture in Sam Altman\\'s startup class at Stanford. It\\'s \\nintended for college students, but much of it is applicable to potential founders at other ages.)\\nOne of the advantages of having kids is that when you have to give advice, you can ask \\nyourself \"what would I tell my own kids?\" My kids are little, but I can imagine what I\\'d tell them \\nabout startups if they were in college, and that\\'s what I\\'m going to tell you.\\nStartups are very counterintuitive. I\\'m not sure why. Maybe it\\'s just because knowledge about \\nth', \"ine what I'd tell them \\nabout startups if they were in college, and that's what I'm going to tell you.\\nStartups are very counterintuitive. I'm not sure why. Maybe it's just because knowledge about \\nthem hasn't permeated our culture yet. But whatever the reason, starting a startup is a task \\nwhere you can't always trust your instincts.\\nIt's like skiing in that way. When you first try skiing and you want to slow down, your instinct is to \\nlean back. But if you lean back on skis you fly down the hill out of control. So part of learning to \\nski is learning to suppress that impulse. Eventually you get new habits, but at first it takes a \\nconscious effort. At first there's a list of things you're trying to remember as you start down the \\nhill.\\nStartups are as unnatural as skiing, so there's a similar list for startups. Here I'm going to give \\nyou the first part of it — the things to remember if you want to prepare yourself to start a startup.\\nCounterintuitive\\nThe first item on it is the fact\", 'milar list for startups. Here I\\'m going to give \\nyou the first part of it — the things to remember if you want to prepare yourself to start a startup.\\nCounterintuitive\\nThe first item on it is the fact I already mentioned: that startups are so weird that if you trust \\nyour instincts, you\\'ll make a lot of mistakes. If you know nothing more than this, you may at least \\npause before making them.\\nWhen I was running Y Combinator I used to joke that our function was to tell founders things \\nthey would ignore. It\\'s really true. Batch after batch, the YC partners warn founders about \\nmistakes they\\'re about to make, and the founders ignore them, and then come back a year later \\nand say \"I wish we\\'d listened.\"\\nWhy do the founders ignore the partners\\' advice? Well, that\\'s the thing about counterintuitive \\nideas: they contradict your intuitions. They seem wrong. So of course your first impulse is to \\ndisregard them. And in fact my joking description is not merely the curse of Y Combinator but \\npart', 'ive \\nideas: they contradict your intuitions. They seem wrong. So of course your first impulse is to \\ndisregard them. And in fact my joking description is not merely the curse of Y Combinator but \\npart of its raison d\\'etre. If founders\\' instincts already gave them the right answers, they wouldn\\'t \\nneed us. You only need other people to give you advice that surprises you. That\\'s why there are \\na lot of ski instructors and not many running instructors. [1]\\nYou can, however, trust your instincts about people. And in fact one of the most common \\nmistakes young founders make is not to do that enough. They get involved with people who \\nseem impressive, but about whom they feel some misgivings personally. Later when things blow \\nup they say \"I knew there was something off about him, but I ignored it because he seemed so \\nimpressive.\"\\nIf you\\'re thinking about getting involved with someone — as a cofounder, an employee, an \\ninvestor, or an acquirer — and you have misgivings about them, trust you', 'it because he seemed so \\nimpressive.\"\\nIf you\\'re thinking about getting involved with someone — as a cofounder, an employee, an \\ninvestor, or an acquirer — and you have misgivings about them, trust your gut. If someone \\nseems slippery, or bogus, or a jerk, don\\'t ignore it.\\nThis is one case where it pays to be self-indulgent. Work with people you genuinely like, and \\nyou\\'ve known long enough to be sure.\\nExpertise\\nThe second counterintuitive point is that it\\'s not that important to know a lot about startups. The \\nway to succeed in a startup is not to be an expert on startups, but to be an expert on your users \\nand the problem you\\'re solving for them. Mark Zuckerberg didn\\'t succeed because he was an \\nexpert on startups. He succeeded despite being a complete noob at startups, because he \\nunderstood his users really well.\\nIf you don\\'t know anything about, say, how to raise an angel round, don\\'t feel bad on that \\naccount. That sort of thing you can learn when you need to, and forget after you', 'tood his users really well.\\nIf you don\\'t know anything about, say, how to raise an angel round, don\\'t feel bad on that \\naccount. That sort of thing you can learn when you need to, and forget after you\\'ve done it.\\nIn fact, I worry it\\'s not merely unnecessary to learn in great detail about the mechanics of \\nstartups, but possibly somewhat dangerous. If I met an undergrad who knew all about \\nconvertible notes and employee agreements and (God forbid) class FF stock, I wouldn\\'t think \\n\"here is someone who is way ahead of their peers.\" It would set off alarms. Because another of \\nthe characteristic mistakes of young founders is to go through the motions of starting a startup. \\nThey make up some plausible-sounding idea, raise money at a good valuation, rent a cool \\noffice, hire a bunch of people. From the outside that seems like what startups do. But the next \\nstep after rent a cool office and hire a bunch of people is: gradually realize how completely \\nfucked they are, because while imitatin', \" From the outside that seems like what startups do. But the next \\nstep after rent a cool office and hire a bunch of people is: gradually realize how completely \\nfucked they are, because while imitating all the outward forms of a startup they have neglected \\nthe one thing that's actually essential: making something people want.\\nGame\\nWe saw this happen so often that we made up a name for it: playing house. Eventually I \\nrealized why it was happening. The reason young founders go through the motions of starting a \\nstartup is because that's what they've been trained to do for their whole lives up to that point. \\nThink about what you have to do to get into college, for example. Extracurricular activities, \\ncheck. Even in college classes most of the work is as artificial as running laps.\\nI'm not attacking the educational system for being this way. There will always be a certain \\namount of fakeness in the work you do when you're being taught something, and if you \\nmeasure their performance it\", \" attacking the educational system for being this way. There will always be a certain \\namount of fakeness in the work you do when you're being taught something, and if you \\nmeasure their performance it's inevitable that people will exploit the difference to the point \\nwhere much of what you're measuring is artifacts of the fakeness.\\nI confess I did it myself in college. I found that in a lot of classes there might only be 20 or 30 \\nideas that were the right shape to make good exam questions. The way I studied for exams in \\nthese classes was not (except incidentally) to master the material taught in the class, but to \\nmake a list of potential exam questions and work out the answers in advance. When I walked \\ninto the final, the main thing I'd be feeling was curiosity about which of my questions would turn \\nup on the exam. It was like a game.\\nIt's not surprising that after being trained for their whole lives to play such games, young \\nfounders' first impulse on starting a startup is to tr\", 'ons would turn \\nup on the exam. It was like a game.\\nIt\\'s not surprising that after being trained for their whole lives to play such games, young \\nfounders\\' first impulse on starting a startup is to try to figure out the tricks for winning at this \\nnew game. Since fundraising appears to be the measure of success for startups (another \\nclassic noob mistake), they always want to know what the tricks are for convincing investors. \\nWe tell them the best way to convince investors is to make a startup that\\'s actually doing well, \\nmeaning growing fast, and then simply tell investors so. Then they want to know what the tricks \\nare for growing fast. And we have to tell them the best way to do that is simply to make \\nsomething people want.\\nSo many of the conversations YC partners have with young founders begin with the founder \\nasking \"How do we...\" and the partner replying \"Just...\"\\nWhy do the founders always make things so complicated? The reason, I realized, is that they\\'re \\nlooking for the tr', 'ders begin with the founder \\nasking \"How do we...\" and the partner replying \"Just...\"\\nWhy do the founders always make things so complicated? The reason, I realized, is that they\\'re \\nlooking for the trick.\\nSo this is the third counterintuitive thing to remember about startups: starting a startup is where \\ngaming the system stops working. Gaming the system may continue to work if you go to work \\nfor a big company. Depending on how broken the company is, you can succeed by sucking up \\nto the right people, giving the impression of productivity, and so on. [2] But that doesn\\'t work \\nwith startups. There is no boss to trick, only users, and all users care about is whether your \\nproduct does what they want. Startups are as impersonal as physics. You have to make \\nsomething people want, and you prosper only to the extent you do.\\nThe dangerous thing is, faking does work to some degree on investors. If you\\'re super good at \\nsounding like you know what you\\'re talking about, you can fool investors', \"osper only to the extent you do.\\nThe dangerous thing is, faking does work to some degree on investors. If you're super good at \\nsounding like you know what you're talking about, you can fool investors for at least one and \\nperhaps even two rounds of funding. But it's not in your interest to. The company is ultimately \\ndoomed. All you're doing is wasting your own time riding it down.\\nSo stop looking for the trick. There are tricks in startups, as there are in any domain, but they \\nare an order of magnitude less important than solving the real problem. A founder who knows \\nnothing about fundraising but has made something users love will have an easier time raising \\nmoney than one who knows every trick in the book but has a flat usage graph. And more \\nimportantly, the founder who has made something users love is the one who will go on to \\nsucceed after raising the money.\\nThough in a sense it's bad news in that you're deprived of one of your most powerful weapons, I \\nthink it's exciting th\", \"ething users love is the one who will go on to \\nsucceed after raising the money.\\nThough in a sense it's bad news in that you're deprived of one of your most powerful weapons, I \\nthink it's exciting that gaming the system stops working when you start a startup. It's exciting \\nthat there even exist parts of the world where you win by doing good work. Imagine how \\ndepressing the world would be if it were all like school and big companies, where you either \\nhave to spend a lot of time on bullshit things or lose to people who do. [3] I would have been \\ndelighted if I'd realized in college that there were parts of the real world where gaming the \\nsystem mattered less than others, and a few where it hardly mattered at all. But there are, and \\nthis variation is one of the most important things to consider when you're thinking about your \\nfuture. How do you win in each type of work, and what would you like to win by doing? [4]\\nAll-Consuming\\nThat brings us to our fourth counterintuitive point: s\", \"consider when you're thinking about your \\nfuture. How do you win in each type of work, and what would you like to win by doing? [4]\\nAll-Consuming\\nThat brings us to our fourth counterintuitive point: startups are all-consuming. If you start a \\nstartup, it will take over your life to a degree you cannot imagine. And if your startup succeeds, it \\nwill take over your life for a long time: for several years at the very least, maybe for a decade, \\nmaybe for the rest of your working life. So there is a real opportunity cost here.\\nLarry Page may seem to have an enviable life, but there are aspects of it that are unenviable. \\nBasically at 25 he started running as fast as he could and it must seem to him that he hasn't \\nstopped to catch his breath since. Every day new shit happens in the Google empire that only \\nthe CEO can deal with, and he, as CEO, has to deal with it. If he goes on vacation for even a \\nweek, a whole week's backlog of shit accumulates. And he has to bear this uncomplainingly, \", \"re that only \\nthe CEO can deal with, and he, as CEO, has to deal with it. If he goes on vacation for even a \\nweek, a whole week's backlog of shit accumulates. And he has to bear this uncomplainingly, \\npartly because as the company's daddy he can never show fear or weakness, and partly \\nbecause billionaires get less than zero sympathy if they talk about having difficult lives. Which \\nhas the strange side effect that the difficulty of being a successful startup founder is concealed \\nfrom almost everyone except those who've done it.\\nY Combinator has now funded several companies that can be called big successes, and in \\nevery single case the founders say the same thing. It never gets any easier. The nature of the \\nproblems change. You're worrying about construction delays at your London office instead of \\nthe broken air conditioner in your studio apartment. But the total volume of worry never \\ndecreases; if anything it increases.\\nStarting a successful startup is similar to having kids in t\", \" instead of \\nthe broken air conditioner in your studio apartment. But the total volume of worry never \\ndecreases; if anything it increases.\\nStarting a successful startup is similar to having kids in that it's like a button you push that \\nchanges your life irrevocably. And while it's truly wonderful having kids, there are a lot of things \\nthat are easier to do before you have them than after. Many of which will make you a better \\nparent when you do have kids. And since you can delay pushing the button for a while, most \\npeople in rich countries do.\\nYet when it comes to startups, a lot of people seem to think they're supposed to start them \\nwhile they're still in college. Are you crazy? And what are the universities thinking? They go out \\nof their way to ensure their students are well supplied with contraceptives, and yet they're \\nsetting up entrepreneurship programs and startup incubators left and right.\\nTo be fair, the universities have their hand forced here. A lot of incoming student\", \"ed with contraceptives, and yet they're \\nsetting up entrepreneurship programs and startup incubators left and right.\\nTo be fair, the universities have their hand forced here. A lot of incoming students are interested \\nin startups. Universities are, at least de facto, expected to prepare them for their careers. So \\nstudents who want to start startups hope universities can teach them about startups. And \\nwhether universities can do this or not, there's some pressure to claim they can, lest they lose \\napplicants to other universities that do.\\nCan universities teach students about startups? Yes and no. They can teach students about \\nstartups, but as I explained before, this is not what you need to know. What you need to learn \\nabout are the needs of your own users, and you can't do that until you actually start the \\ncompany. [5] So starting a startup is intrinsically something you can only really learn by doing it. \\nAnd it's impossible to do that in college, for the reason I just explained\", \"you actually start the \\ncompany. [5] So starting a startup is intrinsically something you can only really learn by doing it. \\nAnd it's impossible to do that in college, for the reason I just explained: startups take over your \\nlife. You can't start a startup for real as a student, because if you start a startup for real you're \\nnot a student anymore. You may be nominally a student for a bit, but you won't even be that for \\nlong. [6]\\nGiven this dichotomy, which of the two paths should you take? Be a real student and not start a \\nstartup, or start a real startup and not be a student? I can answer that one for you. Do not start \\na startup in college. How to start a startup is just a subset of a bigger problem you're trying to \\nsolve: how to have a good life. And though starting a startup can be part of a good life for a lot \\nof ambitious people, age 20 is not the optimal time to do it. Starting a startup is like a brutally \\nfast depth-first search.

Starting a startup is like a brutally \\nfast depth-first search. Most people should still be searching breadth-first at 20.\\nYou can do things in your early 20s that you can\\'t do as well before or after, like plunge deeply \\ninto projects on a whim and travel super cheaply with no sense of a deadline. For unambitious \\npeople, this sort of thing is the dreaded \"failure to launch,\" but for the ambitious ones it can be \\nan incomparably valuable sort of exploration. If you start a startup at 20 and you\\'re sufficiently \\nsuccessful, you\\'ll never get to do it. [7]\\nMark Zuckerberg will never get to bum around a foreign country. He can do other things most \\npeople can\\'t, like charter jets to fly him to foreign countries. But success has taken a lot of the \\nserendipity out of his life. Facebook is running him as much as he\\'s running Facebook. And \\nwhile it can be very cool to be in the grip of a project ', \"ign countries. But success has taken a lot of the \\nserendipity out of his life. Facebook is running him as much as he's running Facebook. And \\nwhile it can be very cool to be in the grip of a project you consider your life's work, there are \\nadvantages to serendipity too, especially early in life. Among other things it gives you more \\noptions to choose your life's work from.\\nThere's not even a tradeoff here. You're not sacrificing anything if you forgo starting a startup at \\n20, because you're more likely to succeed if you wait. In the unlikely case that you're 20 and \\none of your side projects takes off like Facebook did, you'll face a choice of running with it or \\nnot, and it may be reasonable to run with it. But the usual way startups take off is for the \\nfounders to make them take off, and it's gratuitously stupid to do that at 20.\\nTry\\nShould you do it at any age? I realize I've made startups sound pretty hard. If I haven't, let me \\ntry again: starting a startup is really hard. Wha\", \" and it's gratuitously stupid to do that at 20.\\nTry\\nShould you do it at any age? I realize I've made startups sound pretty hard. If I haven't, let me \\ntry again: starting a startup is really hard. What if it's too hard? How can you tell if you're up to \\nthis challenge?\\nThe answer is the fifth counterintuitive point: you can't tell. Your life so far may have given you \\nsome idea what your prospects might be if you tried to become a mathematician, or a \\nprofessional football player. But unless you've had a very strange life you haven't done much \\nthat was like being a startup founder. Starting a startup will change you a lot. So what you're \\ntrying to estimate is not just what you are, but what you could grow into, and who can do that?\\nFor the past 9 years it was my job to predict whether people would have what it took to start \\nsuccessful startups. It was easy to tell how smart they were, and most people reading this will \\nbe over that threshold. The hard part was predicting how tough a\", \"ople would have what it took to start \\nsuccessful startups. It was easy to tell how smart they were, and most people reading this will \\nbe over that threshold. The hard part was predicting how tough and ambitious they would \\nbecome. There may be no one who has more experience at trying to predict that, so I can tell \\nyou how much an expert can know about it, and the answer is: not much. I learned to keep a \\ncompletely open mind about which of the startups in each batch would turn out to be the stars.\\nThe founders sometimes think they know. Some arrive feeling sure they will ace Y Combinator \\njust as they've aced every one of the (few, artificial, easy) tests they've faced in life so far. \\nOthers arrive wondering how they got in, and hoping YC doesn't discover whatever mistake \\ncaused it to accept them. But there is little correlation between founders' initial attitudes and \\nhow well their companies do.\\nI've read that the same is true in the military — that the swaggering recruits are n\", \" accept them. But there is little correlation between founders' initial attitudes and \\nhow well their companies do.\\nI've read that the same is true in the military — that the swaggering recruits are no more likely \\nto turn out to be really tough than the quiet ones. And probably for the same reason: that the \\ntests involved are so different from the ones in their previous lives.\\nIf you're absolutely terrified of starting a startup, you probably shouldn't do it. But if you're \\nmerely unsure whether you're up to it, the only way to find out is to try. Just not now.\\nIdeas\\nSo if you want to start a startup one day, what should you do in college? There are only two \\nthings you need initially: an idea and cofounders. And the m.o. for getting both is the same. \\nWhich leads to our sixth and last counterintuitive point: that the way to get startup ideas is not \\nto try to think of startup ideas.\\nI've written a whole essay on this, so I won't repeat it all here. But the short version is that if y\", \"ounterintuitive point: that the way to get startup ideas is not \\nto try to think of startup ideas.\\nI've written a whole essay on this, so I won't repeat it all here. But the short version is that if you \\nmake a conscious effort to think of startup ideas, the ideas you come up with will not merely be \\nbad, but bad and plausible-sounding, meaning you'll waste a lot of time on them before \\nrealizing they're bad.\\nThe way to come up with good startup ideas is to take a step back. Instead of making a \\nconscious effort to think of startup ideas, turn your mind into the type that startup ideas form in \\nwithout any conscious effort. In fact, so unconsciously that you don't even realize at first that \\nthey're startup ideas.\\nThis is not only possible, it's how Apple, Yahoo, Google, and Facebook all got started. None of \\nthese companies were even meant to be companies at first. They were all just side projects. \\nThe best startups almost have to start as side projects, because great ideas tend to b\", 'ot started. None of \\nthese companies were even meant to be companies at first. They were all just side projects. \\nThe best startups almost have to start as side projects, because great ideas tend to be such \\noutliers that your conscious mind would reject them as ideas for companies.\\nOk, so how do you turn your mind into the type that startup ideas form in unconsciously? (1) \\nLearn a lot about things that matter, then (2) work on problems that interest you (3) with people \\nyou like and respect. The third part, incidentally, is how you get cofounders at the same time as \\nthe idea.\\nThe first time I wrote that paragraph, instead of \"learn a lot about things that matter,\" I wrote \\n\"become good at some technology.\" But that prescription, though sufficient, is too narrow. What \\nwas special about Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia was not that they were experts in technology. \\nThey were good at design, and perhaps even more importantly, they were good at organizing \\ngroups and making projects happen.', \"Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia was not that they were experts in technology. \\nThey were good at design, and perhaps even more importantly, they were good at organizing \\ngroups and making projects happen. So you don't have to work on technology per se, so long \\nas you work on problems demanding enough to stretch you.\\nWhat kind of problems are those? That is very hard to answer in the general case. History is full \\nof examples of young people who were working on important problems that no one else at the \\ntime thought were important, and in particular that their parents didn't think were important. On \\nthe other hand, history is even fuller of examples of parents who thought their kids were \\nwasting their time and who were right. So how do you know when you're working on real stuff? \\n[8]\\nI know how I know. Real problems are interesting, and I am self-indulgent in the sense that I \\nalways want to work on interesting things, even if no one else cares about them (in fact, \\nespecially if no one\", \" how I know. Real problems are interesting, and I am self-indulgent in the sense that I \\nalways want to work on interesting things, even if no one else cares about them (in fact, \\nespecially if no one else cares about them), and find it very hard to make myself work on boring \\nthings, even if they're supposed to be important.\\nMy life is full of case after case where I worked on something just because it seemed \\ninteresting, and it turned out later to be useful in some worldly way. Y Combinator itself was \\nsomething I only did because it seemed interesting. So I seem to have some sort of internal \\ncompass that helps me out. But I don't know what other people have in their heads. Maybe if I \\nthink more about this I can come up with heuristics for recognizing genuinely interesting \\nproblems, but for the moment the best I can offer is the hopelessly question-begging advice that \\nif you have a taste for genuinely interesting problems, indulging it energetically is the best way \\nto prepare y\", 'but for the moment the best I can offer is the hopelessly question-begging advice that \\nif you have a taste for genuinely interesting problems, indulging it energetically is the best way \\nto prepare yourself for a startup. And indeed, probably also the best way to live. [9]\\nBut although I can\\'t explain in the general case what counts as an interesting problem, I can tell \\nyou about a large subset of them. If you think of technology as something that\\'s spreading like a \\nsort of fractal stain, every moving point on the edge represents an interesting problem. So one \\nguaranteed way to turn your mind into the type that has good startup ideas is to get yourself to \\nthe leading edge of some technology — to cause yourself, as Paul Buchheit put it, to \"live in the \\nfuture.\" When you reach that point, ideas that will seem to other people uncannily prescient will \\nseem obvious to you. You may not realize they\\'re startup ideas, but you\\'ll know they\\'re \\nsomething that ought to exist.\\nFor example, ', 'nt, ideas that will seem to other people uncannily prescient will \\nseem obvious to you. You may not realize they\\'re startup ideas, but you\\'ll know they\\'re \\nsomething that ought to exist.\\nFor example, back at Harvard in the mid 90s a fellow grad student of my friends Robert and \\nTrevor wrote his own voice over IP software. He didn\\'t mean it to be a startup, and he never \\ntried to turn it into one. He just wanted to talk to his girlfriend in Taiwan without paying for long \\ndistance calls, and since he was an expert on networks it seemed obvious to him that the way \\nto do it was turn the sound into packets and ship it over the Internet. He never did any more \\nwith his software than talk to his girlfriend, but this is exactly the way the best startups get \\nstarted.\\nSo strangely enough the optimal thing to do in college if you want to be a successful startup \\nfounder is not some sort of new, vocational version of college focused on \"entrepreneurship.\" \\nIt\\'s the classic version of college as', 'mal thing to do in college if you want to be a successful startup \\nfounder is not some sort of new, vocational version of college focused on \"entrepreneurship.\" \\nIt\\'s the classic version of college as education for its own sake.

Could you endure studying literary theory, or working in middle management at a \\nlarge company?\\n[10] In fact, if your goal is to start a startup, you can stick even more closely to the ideal of a liberal education than \\npast generations have. Back when students focused mainly on getting a job after college, they thought at least a little \\nabout how the courses they took might look to an employer.

Get funded by Y Combinator. \\n September 2013\\nMost startups that raise money do it more than once. A typical trajectory might be (1) to get \\nstarted with a few tens of thousands from something like Y Combinator or individual angels, \\nthen (2) raise a few hundred thousand to a few million to build the company, and then (3) once \\nthe company is clearly succeeding, raise one or more later rounds to accelerate growth.\\nReality can be messier. Some companies raise money twice in \", \"ew million to build the company, and then (3) once \\nthe company is clearly succeeding, raise one or more later rounds to accelerate growth.\\nReality can be messier. Some companies raise money twice in phase 2. Others skip phase 1 \\nand go straight to phase 2. And at Y Combinator we get an increasing number of companies \\nthat have already raised amounts in the hundreds of thousands. But the three phase path is at \\nleast the one about which individual startups' paths oscillate.\\nThis essay focuses on phase 2 fundraising. That's the type the startups we fund are doing on \\nDemo Day, and this essay is the advice we give them.\\nForces\\nFundraising is hard in both senses: hard like lifting a heavy weight, and hard like solving a \\npuzzle. It's hard like lifting a weight because it's intrinsically hard to convince people to part with \\nlarge sums of money. That problem is irreducible; it should be hard. But much of the other kind \\nof difficulty can be eliminated. Fundraising only seems a puzzle becau\", \"to convince people to part with \\nlarge sums of money. That problem is irreducible; it should be hard. But much of the other kind \\nof difficulty can be eliminated. Fundraising only seems a puzzle because it's an alien world to \\nmost founders, and I hope to fix that by supplying a map through it.\\nTo founders, the behavior of investors is often opaque — partly because their motivations are \\nobscure, but partly because they deliberately mislead you. And the misleading ways of \\ninvestors combine horribly with the wishful thinking of inexperienced founders. At YC we're \\nalways warning founders about this danger, and investors are probably more circumspect with \\nYC startups than with other companies they talk to, and even so we witness a constant series \\nof explosions as these two volatile components combine. [1]\\nIf you're an inexperienced founder, the only way to survive is by imposing external constraints \\non yourself. You can't trust your intuitions. I'm going to give you a set of rules he\", \"ents combine. [1]\\nIf you're an inexperienced founder, the only way to survive is by imposing external constraints \\non yourself. You can't trust your intuitions. I'm going to give you a set of rules here that will get \\nyou through this process if anything will. At certain moments you'll be tempted to ignore them. \\nSo rule number zero is: these rules exist for a reason. You wouldn't need a rule to keep you \\ngoing in one direction if there weren't powerful forces pushing you in another.\\nThe ultimate source of the forces acting on you are the forces acting on investors. Investors are \\npinched between two kinds of fear: fear of investing in startups that fizzle, and fear of missing \\nout on startups that take off. The cause of all this fear is the very thing that makes startups such \\nattractive investments: the successful ones grow very fast. But that fast growth means investors \\ncan't wait around. If you wait till a startup is obviously a success, it's too late. To get the really \\nhigh retu\", \"investments: the successful ones grow very fast. But that fast growth means investors \\ncan't wait around. If you wait till a startup is obviously a success, it's too late. To get the really \\nhigh returns, you have to invest in startups when it's still unclear how they'll do. But that in turn \\nmakes investors nervous they're about to invest in a flop. As indeed they often are.\\nWhat investors would like to do, if they could, is wait. When a startup is only a few months old, \\nevery week that passes gives you significantly more information about them. But if you wait too \\nlong, other investors might take the deal away from you. And of course the other investors are \\nall subject to the same forces. So what tends to happen is that they all wait as long as they can, \\nthen when some act the rest have to.\\nDon't raise money unless you want it and it wants you.\\nSuch a high proportion of successful startups raise money that it might seem fundraising is one \\nof the defining qualities of a startup. \", \"ave to.\\nDon't raise money unless you want it and it wants you.\\nSuch a high proportion of successful startups raise money that it might seem fundraising is one \\nof the defining qualities of a startup. Actually it isn't. Rapid growth is what makes a company a \\nstartup. Most companies in a position to grow rapidly find that (a) taking outside money helps \\nthem grow faster, and (b) their growth potential makes it easy to attract such money. It's so \\ncommon for both (a) and (b) to be true of a successful startup that practically all do raise \\noutside money. But there may be cases where a startup either wouldn't want to grow faster, or \\noutside money wouldn't help them to, and if you're one of them, don't raise money.\\nThe other time not to raise money is when you won't be able to. If you try to raise money before \\nyou can convince investors, you'll not only waste your time, but also burn your reputation with \\nthose investors.\\nBe in fundraising mode or not.\\nOne of the things that surprises fo\", \"raise money before \\nyou can convince investors, you'll not only waste your time, but also burn your reputation with \\nthose investors.\\nBe in fundraising mode or not.\\nOne of the things that surprises founders most about fundraising is how distracting it is. When \\nyou start fundraising, everything else grinds to a halt. The problem is not the time fundraising \\nconsumes but that it becomes the top idea in your mind. A startup can't endure that level of \\ndistraction for long. An early stage startup grows mostly because the founders make it grow, \\nand if the founders look away, growth usually drops sharply.\\nBecause fundraising is so distracting, a startup should either be in fundraising mode or not. And \\nwhen you do decide to raise money, you should focus your whole attention on it so you can get \\nit done quickly and get back to work. [2]\\nYou can take money from investors when you're not in fundraising mode. You just can't expend \\nany attention on it. There are two things that take attention\", 't \\nit done quickly and get back to work. [2]\\nYou can take money from investors when you\\'re not in fundraising mode. You just can\\'t expend \\nany attention on it. There are two things that take attention: convincing investors, and \\nnegotiating with them. So when you\\'re not in fundraising mode, you should take money from \\ninvestors only if they require no convincing, and are willing to invest on terms you\\'ll take without \\nnegotiation. For example, if a reputable investor is willing to invest on a convertible note, using \\nstandard paperwork, that is either uncapped or capped at a good valuation, you can take that \\nwithout having to think. [3] The terms will be whatever they turn out to be in your next equity \\nround. And \"no convincing\" means just that: zero time spent meeting with investors or preparing \\nmaterials for them. If an investor says they\\'re ready to invest, but they need you to come in for \\none meeting to meet some of the partners, tell them no, if you\\'re not in fundraising mode,', \"preparing \\nmaterials for them. If an investor says they're ready to invest, but they need you to come in for \\none meeting to meet some of the partners, tell them no, if you're not in fundraising mode, \\nbecause that's fundraising. [4] Tell them politely; tell them you're focusing on the company right \\nnow, and that you'll get back to them when you're fundraising; but do not get sucked down the \\nslippery slope.\\nInvestors will try to lure you into fundraising when you're not. It's great for them if they can, \\nbecause they can thereby get a shot at you before everyone else. They'll send you emails \\nsaying they want to meet to learn more about you. If you get cold-emailed by an associate at a \\nVC firm, you shouldn't meet even if you are in fundraising mode. Deals don't happen that way. \\n[5] But even if you get an email from a partner you should try to delay meeting till you're in \\nfundraising mode. They may say they just want to meet and chat, but investors never just want \\nto meet and chat\", \" even if you get an email from a partner you should try to delay meeting till you're in \\nfundraising mode. They may say they just want to meet and chat, but investors never just want \\nto meet and chat. What if they like you? What if they start to talk about giving you money? Will \\nyou be able to resist having that conversation? Unless you're experienced enough at \\nfundraising to have a casual conversation with investors that stays casual, it's safer to tell them \\nthat you'd be happy to later, when you're fundraising, but that right now you need to focus on \\nthe company. [6]\\nCompanies that are successful at raising money in phase 2 sometimes tack on a few investors \\nafter leaving fundraising mode. This is fine; if fundraising went well, you'll be able to do it without \\nspending time convincing them or negotiating about terms.\\nGet introductions to investors.\\nBefore you can talk to investors, you have to be introduced to them. If you're presenting at a \\nDemo Day, you'll be introduced to a\", \"ing them or negotiating about terms.\\nGet introductions to investors.\\nBefore you can talk to investors, you have to be introduced to them. If you're presenting at a \\nDemo Day, you'll be introduced to a whole bunch simultaneously. But even if you are, you \\nshould supplement these with intros you collect yourself.\\nDo you have to be introduced? In phase 2, yes. Some investors will let you email them a \\nbusiness plan, but you can tell from the way their sites are organized that they don't really want \\nstartups to approach them directly.\\nIntros vary greatly in effectiveness. The best type of intro is from a well-known investor who has \\njust invested in you. So when you get an investor to commit, ask them to introduce you to other \\ninvestors they respect. [7] The next best type of intro is from a founder of a company they've \\nfunded. You can also get intros from other people in the startup community, like lawyers and \\nreporters.\\nThere are now sites like AngelList, FundersClub, and WeFunder th\", \" founder of a company they've \\nfunded. You can also get intros from other people in the startup community, like lawyers and \\nreporters.\\nThere are now sites like AngelList, FundersClub, and WeFunder that can introduce you to \\ninvestors. We recommend startups treat them as auxiliary sources of money. Raise money first \\nfrom leads you get yourself. Those will on average be better investors. Plus you'll have an \\neasier time raising money on these sites once you can say you've already raised some from \\nwell-known investors.\\nHear no till you hear yes.\\nTreat investors as saying no till they unequivocally say yes, in the form of a definite offer with no \\ncontingencies.\\nI mentioned earlier that investors prefer to wait if they can. What's particularly dangerous for \\nfounders is the way they wait. Essentially, they lead you on. They seem like they're about to \\ninvest right up till the moment they say no. If they even say no. Some of the worse ones never \\nactually do say no; they just stop replyi\", \"ssentially, they lead you on. They seem like they're about to \\ninvest right up till the moment they say no. If they even say no. Some of the worse ones never \\nactually do say no; they just stop replying to your emails. They hope that way to get a free \\noption on investing. If they decide later that they want to invest — usually because they've \\nheard you're a hot deal — they can pretend they just got distracted and then restart the \\nconversation as if they'd been about to. [8]\\nThat's not the worst thing investors will do. Some will use language that makes it sound as if \\nthey're committing, but which doesn't actually commit them. And wishful thinking founders are \\nhappy to meet them half way. [9]\\nFortunately, the next rule is a tactic for neutralizing this behavior. But to work it depends on you \\nnot being tricked by the no that sounds like yes. It's so common for founders to be misled/\\nmistaken about this that we designed a protocol to fix the problem. If you believe an investor \\nhas \", \"on you \\nnot being tricked by the no that sounds like yes. It's so common for founders to be misled/\\nmistaken about this that we designed a protocol to fix the problem. If you believe an investor \\nhas committed, get them to confirm it. If you and they have different views of reality, whether the \\nsource of the discrepancy is their sketchiness or your wishful thinking, the prospect of \\nconfirming a commitment in writing will flush it out. And till they confirm, regard them as saying \\nno.\\nDo breadth-first search weighted by expected value.\\nWhen you talk to investors your m.o. should be breadth-first search, weighted by expected \\nvalue. You should always talk to investors in parallel rather than serially. You can't afford the time \\nit takes to talk to investors serially, plus if you only talk to one investor at a time, they don't have \\nthe pressure of other investors to make them act.

But you shouldn't pay the same attention to \\nevery investor, because some are more promising prospects than others. The optimal solution \\nis to talk to all potential investors in parallel, but give higher priority to the more promising ones. \\n[10]\\nExpected value = how likely an investor is to say yes, multiplied by how good it would be if they \\ndid. So for example, an eminent investor who would invest a lot, but will be hard to convince, \\nmight have the same expected value as an obscure angel who won't invest much, but will be \\neasy to convince. Whereas an obscure angel who will only invest a small amount, and yet \\nneeds to meet multiple times before making up his mind, has very low expected value. Meet \\nsuch investors last, if at all. [11]\\nDoing breadth-first search weighted by expected value will save you from investors who never \\nexplicitly say no but merely drift away, because you'll drift\", \". Meet \\nsuch investors last, if at all. [11]\\nDoing breadth-first search weighted by expected value will save you from investors who never \\nexplicitly say no but merely drift away, because you'll drift away from them at the same rate. It \\nprotects you from investors who flake in much the same way that a distributed algorithm \\nprotects you from processors that fail. If some investor isn't returning your emails, or wants to \\nhave lots of meetings but isn't progressing toward making you an offer, you automatically focus \\nless on them. But you have to be disciplined about assigning probabilities. You can't let how \\nmuch you want an investor influence your estimate of how much they want you.\\nKnow where you stand.\\nHow do you judge how well you're doing with an investor, when investors habitually seem more \\npositive than they are? By looking at their actions rather than their words. Every investor has \\nsome track they need to move along from the first conversation to wiring the money, and you \", \"seem more \\npositive than they are? By looking at their actions rather than their words. Every investor has \\nsome track they need to move along from the first conversation to wiring the money, and you \\nshould always know what that track consists of, where you are on it, and how fast you're moving \\nforward.\\nNever leave a meeting with an investor without asking what happens next. What more do they \\nneed in order to decide? Do they need another meeting with you? To talk about what? And how \\nsoon? Do they need to do something internally, like talk to their partners, or investigate some \\nissue? How long do they expect it to take? Don't be too pushy, but know where you stand. If \\ninvestors are vague or resist answering such questions, assume the worst; investors who are \\nseriously interested in you will usually be happy to talk about what has to happen between now \\nand wiring the money, because they're already running through that in their heads. [12]\\nIf you're experienced at negotiations, yo\", \"ou will usually be happy to talk about what has to happen between now \\nand wiring the money, because they're already running through that in their heads. [12]\\nIf you're experienced at negotiations, you already know how to ask such questions. [13] If you're \\nnot, there's a trick you can use in this situation. Investors know you're inexperienced at raising \\nmoney. Inexperience there doesn't make you unattractive. Being a noob at technology would, if \\nyou're starting a technology startup, but not being a noob at fundraising. Larry and Sergey were \\nnoobs at fundraising. So you can just confess that you're inexperienced at this and ask how \\ntheir process works and where you are in it. [14]\\nGet the first commitment.\\nThe biggest factor in most investors' opinions of you is the opinion of other investors. Once you \\nstart getting investors to commit, it becomes increasingly easy to get more to.

Once you \\nstart getting investors to commit, it becomes increasingly easy to get more to. But the other side \\nof this coin is that it\\'s often hard to get the first commitment.\\nGetting the first substantial offer can be half the total difficulty of fundraising. What counts as a \\nsubstantial offer depends on who it\\'s from and how much it is. Money from friends and family \\ndoesn\\'t usually count, no matter how much. But if you get $50k from a well known VC firm or \\nangel investor, that will usually be enough to set things rolling. [15]\\nClose committed money.\\nIt\\'s not a deal till the money\\'s in the bank. I often hear inexperienced founders say things like \\n\"We\\'ve raised $800,000,\" only to discover that zero of it is in the bank so far. Remember the \\ntwin fears that torment investors? The fear of missing out that makes them jump early, and the \\nfear of jumping onto a turd that results? This is a market where people are exceptionally prone \\nto buyer\\'s remorse. And it\\'s also one that ', \"he fear of missing out that makes them jump early, and the \\nfear of jumping onto a turd that results? This is a market where people are exceptionally prone \\nto buyer's remorse. And it's also one that furnishes them plenty of excuses to gratify it. The \\npublic markets snap startup investing around like a whip. If the Chinese economy blows up \\ntomorrow, all bets are off. But there are lots of surprises for individual startups too, and they \\ntend to be concentrated around fundraising. Tomorrow a big competitor could appear, or you \\ncould get C&Ded, or your cofounder could quit. [16]\\nEven a day's delay can bring news that causes an investor to change their mind. So when \\nsomeone commits, get the money. Knowing where you stand doesn't end when they say they'll \\ninvest. After they say yes, know what the timetable is for getting the money, and then babysit \\nthat process till it happens.

Established ones have \\nlearned to treat saying yes as like diving off a diving board, and they also have more brand to \\npreserve. But I\\'ve heard of cases of even top-tier VC firms welching on deals.\\nAvoid investors who don\\'t \"lead.\"\\nSince getting the first offer is most of the difficulty of fundraising, that should be part of your \\ncalculation of expected value when you start. You have to estimate not just the probability that \\nan investor will say yes, but the probability that they\\'d be the first to say yes, and the latter is not \\nsimply a constant fraction of the former.

Some investors are known for deciding quickly, and \\nthose are extra valuable early on.\\nConversely, an investor who will only invest once other investors have is worthless initially. And \\nwhile most investors are influenced by how interested other investors are in you, there are \\nsome who have an explicit policy of only investing after other investors have. You can recognize \\nthis contemptible subspecies of investor because they often talk about \"leads.\" They say that \\nthey don\\'t lead, or that they\\'ll invest once you have a lead. Sometimes they even claim to be \\nwilling to lead themselves, by which they mean they won\\'t invest till you get $x from other \\ninvestors. (It\\'s great if by \"lead\" they mean they\\'ll invest unilaterally, and in addition will help you \\nraise more. What\\'s lame is when they use the term to mean they won\\'t invest unless you can \\nraise more elsewhere.) [17]\\nWhere does this term \"lead\" come fro', 'nilaterally, and in addition will help you \\nraise more. What\\'s lame is when they use the term to mean they won\\'t invest unless you can \\nraise more elsewhere.) [17]\\nWhere does this term \"lead\" come from? Up till a few years ago, startups raising money in \\nphase 2 would usually raise equity rounds in which several investors invested at the same time \\nusing the same paperwork. You\\'d negotiate the terms with one \"lead\" investor, and then all the \\nothers would sign the same documents and all the money change hands at the closing.\\nSeries A rounds still work that way, but things now work differently for most fundraising prior to \\nthe series A. Now there are rarely actual rounds before the A round, or leads for them. Now \\nstartups simply raise money from investors one at a time till they feel they have enough.\\nSince there are no longer leads, why do investors use that term? Because it\\'s a more legitimate-\\nsounding way of saying what they really mean. All they really mean is that their interest', ' have enough.\\nSince there are no longer leads, why do investors use that term? Because it\\'s a more legitimate-\\nsounding way of saying what they really mean. All they really mean is that their interest in you is \\na function of other investors\\' interest in you. I.e. the spectral signature of all mediocre investors. \\nBut when phrased in terms of leads, it sounds like there is something structural and therefore \\nlegitimate about their behavior.\\nWhen an investor tells you \"I want to invest in you, but I don\\'t lead,\" translate that in your mind \\nto \"No, except yes if you turn out to be a hot deal.\" And since that\\'s the default opinion of any \\ninvestor about any startup, they\\'ve essentially just told you nothing.\\nWhen you first start fundraising, the expected value of an investor who won\\'t \"lead\" is zero, so \\ntalk to such investors last if at all.\\nHave multiple plans.\\nMany investors will ask how much you\\'re planning to raise. This question makes founders feel \\nthey should be planning to raise', ' is zero, so \\ntalk to such investors last if at all.\\nHave multiple plans.\\nMany investors will ask how much you\\'re planning to raise. This question makes founders feel \\nthey should be planning to raise a specific amount. But in fact you shouldn\\'t. It\\'s a mistake to \\nhave fixed plans in an undertaking as unpredictable as fundraising.\\nSo why do investors ask how much you plan to raise? For much the same reasons a \\nsalesperson in a store will ask \"How much were you planning to spend?\" if you walk in looking \\nfor a gift for a friend. You probably didn\\'t have a precise amount in mind; you just want to find \\nsomething good, and if it\\'s inexpensive, so much the better. The salesperson asks you this not \\nbecause you\\'re supposed to have a plan to spend a specific amount, but so they can show you \\nonly things that cost the most you\\'ll pay.\\nSimilarly, when investors ask how much you plan to raise, it\\'s not because you\\'re supposed to \\nhave a plan.

But if you\\'re in the inexperienced but earnest \\nmajority, the solution is analogous to the solution I recommend for pitching your startup: do the \\nright thing and then just tell investors what you\\'re doing.\\nAnd the right strategy, in fundraising, is to have multiple plans depending on how much you can \\nraise.

If you're talking to a VC firm that only does series A \\nrounds (though there are few of those left), it would be a waste of time talking about any but \\nyour most expensive plan. Whereas if you're talking to an angel who invests $20k at a time and \\nyou haven't raised any money yet, you probably want to focus on your least expensive plan.\\nIf you're so fortunate as to have to think about the upper limit on what you should raise, a good \\nrule of thumb is to multiply the number of people you want to hire times $15k times 18 months. \\nIn most startups, nearly all the costs are a fun\", \"about the upper limit on what you should raise, a good \\nrule of thumb is to multiply the number of people you want to hire times $15k times 18 months. \\nIn most startups, nearly all the costs are a function of the number of people, and $15k per \\nmonth is the conventional total cost (including benefits and even office space) per person. $15k \\nper month is high, so don't actually spend that much.

But as time passes it gets \\nincreasingly difficult to fundraise from a position of strength without being profitable. [19]\\nDon't optimize for valuation.\\nWhen you raise money, what should your valuation be? The most important thing to understand \\nabout valuation is that it's not that important.\\nFounders who raise money at high valuations tend to be unduly proud of it. Founders are often \\ncompetitive people, and since valuation is usually the only visible number attached to a startup, \\nthey end up competing to raise money at the highest valuation. This is stupid, because \\nfundraising is not the test that matters. The real test is revenue. Fundraising is just a means to \\nthat end. Being proud of how well you did at fundraising is like being proud\", \"his is stupid, because \\nfundraising is not the test that matters. The real test is revenue. Fundraising is just a means to \\nthat end. Being proud of how well you did at fundraising is like being proud of your college \\ngrades.\\nNot only is fundraising not the test that matters, valuation is not even the thing to optimize about \\nfundraising. The number one thing you want from phase 2 fundraising is to get the money you \\nneed, so you can get back to focusing on the real test, the success of your company. Number \\ntwo is good investors. Valuation is at best third.\\nThe empirical evidence shows just how unimportant it is. Dropbox and Airbnb are the most \\nsuccessful companies we've funded so far, and they raised money after Y Combinator at \\npremoney valuations of $4 million and $2.6 million respectively. Prices are so much higher now \\nthat if you can raise money at all you'll probably raise it at higher valuations than Dropbox and \\nAirbnb. So let that satisfy your competitiveness. You're doing \", \"ively. Prices are so much higher now \\nthat if you can raise money at all you'll probably raise it at higher valuations than Dropbox and \\nAirbnb. So let that satisfy your competitiveness. You're doing better than Dropbox and Airbnb! At \\na test that doesn't matter.\\nWhen you start fundraising, your initial valuation (or valuation cap) will be set by the deal you \\nmake with the first investor who commits. You can increase the price for later investors, if you \\nget a lot of interest, but by default the valuation you got from the first investor becomes your \\nasking price.\\nSo if you're raising money from multiple investors, as most companies do in phase 2, you have \\nto be careful to avoid raising the first from an over-eager investor at a price you won't be able to \\nsustain. You can of course lower your price if you need to (in which case you should give the \\nsame terms to investors who invested earlier at a higher price), but you may lose a bunch of \\nleads in the process of realizing you nee\", \"er your price if you need to (in which case you should give the \\nsame terms to investors who invested earlier at a higher price), but you may lose a bunch of \\nleads in the process of realizing you need to do this.\\nWhat you can do if you have eager first investors is raise money from them on an uncapped \\nconvertible note with an MFN clause. This is essentially a way of saying that the valuation cap \\nof the note will be determined by the next investors you raise money from.\\nIt will be easier to raise money at a lower valuation. It shouldn't be, but it is. Since phase 2 \\nprices vary at most 10x and the big successes generate returns of at least 100x, investors \\nshould pick startups entirely based on their estimate of the probability that the company will be \\na big success and hardly at all on price. But although it's a mistake for investors to care about \\nprice, a significant number do. A startup that investors seem to like but won't invest in at a cap \\nof $x will have an easier time at $\", \" price.

A startup that investors seem to like but won't invest in at a cap \\nof $x will have an easier time at $x/2. [20]\\nYes/no before valuation.\\nSome investors want to know what your valuation is before they even talk to you about \\ninvesting. If your valuation has already been set by a prior investment at a specific valuation or \\ncap, you can tell them that number. But if it isn't set because you haven't closed anyone yet, \\nand they try to push you to name a price, resist doing so. If this would be the first investor \\nyou've closed, then this could be the tipping point of fundraising. That means closing this \\ninvestor is the first priority, and you need to get the conversation onto that instead of being \\ndragged sideways into a discussion of price.\\nFortunately there is a way to avoid naming a price in this situation. And it is not just a \\nnegotiating trick; it's how you (both) should be operating.\", 'ng \\ndragged sideways into a discussion of price.\\nFortunately there is a way to avoid naming a price in this situation. And it is not just a \\nnegotiating trick; it\\'s how you (both) should be operating. Tell them that valuation is not the most \\nimportant thing to you and that you haven\\'t thought much about it, that you are looking for \\ninvestors you want to partner with and who want to partner with you, and that you should talk \\nfirst about whether they want to invest at all. Then if they decide they do want to invest, you can \\nfigure out a price. But first things first.\\nSince valuation isn\\'t that important and getting fundraising rolling is, we usually tell founders to \\ngive the first investor who commits as low a price as they need to. This is a safe technique so \\nlong as you combine it with the next one. [21]\\nBeware \"valuation sensitive\" investors.\\nOccasionally you\\'ll encounter investors who describe themselves as \"valuation sensitive.\" What \\nthis means in practice is that they are co', 'th the next one. [21]\\nBeware \"valuation sensitive\" investors.\\nOccasionally you\\'ll encounter investors who describe themselves as \"valuation sensitive.\" What \\nthis means in practice is that they are compulsive negotiators who will suck up a lot of your time \\ntrying to push your price down. You should therefore never approach such investors first. While \\nyou shouldn\\'t chase high valuations, you also don\\'t want your valuation to be set artificially low \\nbecause the first investor who committed happened to be a compulsive negotiator. Some such \\ninvestors have value, but the time to approach them is near the end of fundraising, when you\\'re \\nin a position to say \"this is the price everyone else has paid; take it or leave it\" and not mind if \\nthey leave it. This way, you\\'ll not only get market price, but it will also take less time.\\nIdeally you know which investors have a reputation for being \"valuation sensitive\" and can \\npostpone dealing with them till last, but occasionally one you didn\\'t ', 'ice, but it will also take less time.\\nIdeally you know which investors have a reputation for being \"valuation sensitive\" and can \\npostpone dealing with them till last, but occasionally one you didn\\'t know about will pop up early \\non. The rule of doing breadth first search weighted by expected value already tells you what to \\ndo in this case: slow down your interactions with them.\\nThere are a handful of investors who will try to invest at a lower valuation even when your price \\nhas already been set. Lowering your price is a backup plan you resort to when you discover \\nyou\\'ve let the price get set too high to close all the money you need. So you\\'d only want to talk \\nto this sort of investor if you were about to do that anyway. But since investor meetings have to \\nbe arranged at least a few days in advance and you can\\'t predict when you\\'ll need to resort to \\nlowering your price, this means in practice that you should approach this type of investor last if \\nat all.\\nIf you\\'re surprised by a', 'ays in advance and you can\\'t predict when you\\'ll need to resort to \\nlowering your price, this means in practice that you should approach this type of investor last if \\nat all.\\nIf you\\'re surprised by a lowball offer, treat it as a backup offer and delay responding to it. When \\nsomeone makes an offer in good faith, you have a moral obligation to respond in a reasonable \\ntime. But lowballing you is a dick move that should be met with the corresponding countermove.\\nAccept offers greedily.\\nI\\'m a little leery of using the term \"greedily\" when writing about fundraising lest non-\\nprogrammers misunderstand me, but a greedy algorithm is simply one that doesn\\'t try to look \\ninto the future. A greedy algorithm takes the best of the options in front of it right now. And that \\nis how startups should approach fundraising in phases 2 and later. Don\\'t try to look into the \\nfuture because (a) the future is unpredictable, and indeed in this business you\\'re often being \\ndeliberately misled about it and (b', \"roach fundraising in phases 2 and later. Don't try to look into the \\nfuture because (a) the future is unpredictable, and indeed in this business you're often being \\ndeliberately misled about it and (b) your first priority in fundraising should be to get it finished \\nand get back to work anyway.\\nIf someone makes you an acceptable offer, take it. If you have multiple incompatible offers, take \\nthe best. Don't reject an acceptable offer in the hope of getting a better one in the future.\\nThese simple rules cover a wide variety of cases. If you're raising money from many investors, \\nroll them up as they say yes. As you start to feel you've raised enough, the threshold for \\nacceptable will start to get higher.\\nIn practice offers exist for stretches of time, not points. So when you get an acceptable offer that \\nwould be incompatible with others (e.g. an offer to invest most of the money you need), you can \\ntell the other investors you're talking to that you have an offer good enough to accept\", 'ble offer that \\nwould be incompatible with others (e.g. an offer to invest most of the money you need), you can \\ntell the other investors you\\'re talking to that you have an offer good enough to accept, and give \\nthem a few days to make their own. This could lose you some that might have made an offer if \\nthey had more time. But by definition you don\\'t care; the initial offer was acceptable.\\nSome investors will try to prevent others from having time to decide by giving you an \\n\"exploding\" offer, meaning one that\\'s only valid for a few days. Offers from the very best \\ninvestors explode less frequently and less rapidly — Fred Wilson never gives exploding offers, \\nfor example — because they\\'re confident you\\'ll pick them. But lower-tier investors sometimes \\ngive offers with very short fuses, because they believe no one who had other options would \\nchoose them. A deadline of three working days is acceptable. You shouldn\\'t need more than \\nthat if you\\'ve been talking to investors in parallel. ', 'cause they believe no one who had other options would \\nchoose them. A deadline of three working days is acceptable. You shouldn\\'t need more than \\nthat if you\\'ve been talking to investors in parallel. But a deadline any shorter is a sign you\\'re \\ndealing with a sketchy investor. You can usually call their bluff, and you may need to. [22]\\nIt might seem that instead of accepting offers greedily, your goal should be to get the best \\ninvestors as partners. That is certainly a good goal, but in phase 2 \"get the best investors\" only \\nrarely conflicts with \"accept offers greedily,\" because the best investors don\\'t usually take any \\nlonger to decide than the others. The only case where the two strategies give conflicting advice \\nis when you have to forgo an offer from an acceptable investor to see if you\\'ll get an offer from a \\nbetter one. If you talk to investors in parallel and push back on exploding offers with excessively \\nshort deadlines, that will almost never happen. But if it does, \"get ', 'f you\\'ll get an offer from a \\nbetter one. If you talk to investors in parallel and push back on exploding offers with excessively \\nshort deadlines, that will almost never happen. But if it does, \"get the best investors\" is in the \\naverage case bad advice. The best investors are also the most selective, because they get their \\npick of all the startups. They reject nearly everyone they talk to, which means in the average \\ncase it\\'s a bad trade to exchange a definite offer from an acceptable investor for a potential offer \\nfrom a better one.\\n(The situation is different in phase 1. You can\\'t apply to all the incubators in parallel, because \\nsome offset their schedules to prevent this. In phase 1, \"accept offers greedily\" and \"get the \\nbest investors\" do conflict, so if you want to apply to multiple incubators, you should do it in \\nsuch a way that the ones you want most decide first.)\\nSometimes when you\\'re raising money from multiple investors, a series A will emerge out of \\nthose conversat', \"tiple incubators, you should do it in \\nsuch a way that the ones you want most decide first.)\\nSometimes when you're raising money from multiple investors, a series A will emerge out of \\nthose conversations, and these rules even cover what to do in that case. When an investor \\nstarts to talk to you about a series A, keep taking smaller investments till they actually give you \\na termsheet. There's no practical difficulty. If the smaller investments are on convertible notes, \\nthey'll just convert into the series A round. The series A investor won't like having all these other \\nrandom investors as bedfellows, but if it bothers them so much they should get on with giving \\nyou a termsheet. Till they do, you don't know for sure they will, and the greedy algorithm tells \\nyou what to do. [23]\\nDon't sell more than 25% in phase 2.\\nIf you do well, you will probably raise a series A round eventually. I say probably because things \\nare changing with series A rounds. Startups may start to skip them. B\", \"sell more than 25% in phase 2.\\nIf you do well, you will probably raise a series A round eventually.

[24]\\nWhich means you should avoid doing things in earlier rounds that will mess up raising an A \\nround. For example, if you've sold more than about 40% of your company total, it starts to get \\nharder to raise an A round, because VCs worry there will not be enough stock left to keep the \\nfounders motivated.\\nOur rule of thumb is not to sell more than 25% in phase 2, on top of whatever you sold in phase \\n1, which should be less than 15%.

And since the danger of fundraising is not the time taken up by the actual \\nmeetings but that it becomes the top idea in your mind, the founder who handles fundraising \\nshould make a conscious effort to insulate the other founder(s) from the details of the process. \\n[25]\\n(If the founders mistrust one another, this could cause some friction. But if the founders mistrust \\none another, you have worse problems to worry about than how to organize fundraising.)\\nThe founder who handles fundraising should be the CEO, who should in turn be the most \\nformidable of the founders.

But wait till that point. Introducing an investor to your \\ncofounder(s) should be like introducing a girl/boyfriend to your parents — something you do \\nonly when things reach a certain stage of seriousness.\\nEven if there are still one or more founders focusing on the company during fundraising, growth \\nwill slow.

An investor who\\'s seriously interested will already be working to help you even before they\\'ve \\ncommitted.\\n[15] In principle you might have to think about so-called \"signalling risk.\" If a prestigious VC makes a small seed \\ninvestment in you, what if they don\\'t want to invest the next time you raise money?

After you raise the first million \\ndollars, the company is at least a million dollars more valuable, because it's the same company \\nas before, plus it has a million dollars in the bank.

Founders are often surprised how quickly investors seem to know \\nwhen they start to succeed at raising money. And while there are in fact lots of ways for such \\ninformation to spread among investors, the main vector is probably the founders themselves. \\nThough they're often clueless about technology, most investors are pretty good at reading \\npeople.

But that test is not as simple as it \\nsounds. In startups, as in a lot of other domains, the distribution of outcomes follows a power \\nlaw, but in startups the curve is startlingly steep. The big successes are so big they dwarf the \\nrest. And since there are only a handful each year (the conventional wisdom is 15), investors \\ntreat \"big success\" as if it were binary. Most are interested in you if you seem like you have a \\nchance, however small, of being one of the 15 big successes, and otherwise not.

You need three things: formidable \\nfounders, a promising market, and (usually) some evidence of success so far.\\nFormidable\\nThe most important ingredient is formidable founders. Most investors decide in the first few \\nminutes whether you seem like a winner or a loser, and once their opinion is set it's hard to \\nchange. [2] Every startup has reasons both to invest and not to invest. If investors think you're a \\nwinner they focus on the former, and if not they focus on the latter. For example, it might be a \\nrich market, but with a slow sales cycle. If investors are impressed with you as founders, they \\nsay they want to invest because it's a\", 'and if not they focus on the latter.

Most investors are genuinely unclear in their own \\nminds why they like or dislike startups. If you seem like a winner, they\\'ll like your idea more. But \\ndon\\'t be too smug about this weakness of theirs, because you have it too; almost everyone \\ndoes.\\nThere is a role for ideas of course. They\\'re fuel for the fire that starts with liking the founders. \\nOnce investors like you, you\\'ll see them reaching for ideas: they\\'ll be saying \"yes, and you could \\nalso do x.\" (Whereas when they don\\'t like you, they\\'ll be saying \"but what about y?\")\\nBut the foundation of convincing investors is to seem formidable, and since this isn\\'t a word \\nmost people use in conversation m', 'hereas when they don\\'t like you, they\\'ll be saying \"but what about y?\")\\nBut the foundation of convincing investors is to seem formidable, and since this isn\\'t a word \\nmost people use in conversation much, I should explain what it means. A formidable person is \\none who seems like they\\'ll get what they want, regardless of whatever obstacles are in the way. \\nFormidable is close to confident, except that someone could be confident and mistaken. \\nFormidable is roughly justifiably confident.\\nThere are a handful of people who are really good at seeming formidable — some because \\nthey actually are very formidable and just let it show, and others because they are more or less \\ncon artists. [3] But most founders, including many who will go on to start very successful \\ncompanies, are not that good at seeming formidable the first time they try fundraising. What \\nshould they do?

You\\'ll depart from \\nsincere, but never arrive at convincing.\\nTruth\\nThe way to seem most formidable as an inexperienced founder is to stick to the truth. How \\nformidable you seem isn\\'t a constant. It varies depending on what you\\'re saying. Most people \\ncan seem confident when they\\'re saying \"one plus one is two,\" because they know it\\'s true. The \\nmost diffident person would be puzzled and even slightly contemptuous if they told a VC \"one \\nplus one is two\" and the VC reacted with skepticism. The magic ability of people who are good \\nat seeming formidable is that they can do this with the sentence \"we\\'re going to make a billion \\ndollars a yea', 'one is two\" and the VC reacted with skepticism. The magic ability of people who are good \\nat seeming formidable is that they can do this with the sentence \"we\\'re going to make a billion \\ndollars a year.\" But you can do the same, if not with that sentence with some fairly impressive \\nones, so long as you convince yourself first.\\nThat\\'s the secret. Convince yourself that your startup is worth investing in, and then when you \\nexplain this to investors they\\'ll believe you. And by convince yourself, I don\\'t mean play mind \\ngames with yourself to boost your confidence. I mean truly evaluate whether your startup is \\nworth investing in. If it isn\\'t, don\\'t try to raise money. [5] But if it is, you\\'ll be telling the truth when \\nyou tell investors it\\'s worth investing in, and they\\'ll sense that. You don\\'t have to be a smooth \\npresenter if you understand something well and tell the truth about it.\\nTo evaluate whether your startup is worth investing in, you have to be a domain expert.

If you have a ten \\npage paper due, then ten pages you must write, even if you only have one page of ideas. Even \\nif you have no ideas. You have to produce something. And all too many startups go into \\nfundraising in the same spirit. When they think it's time to raise money, they try gamely to make \\nthe best case they can for their startup.

It's when you can convince investors, and not before. [7]\\nAnd unless you're a good con artist, you'll never convince investors if you're not convinced \\nyourself. They're far better at detecting bullshit than you are at producing it, even if you're \\nproducing it unknowingly. If you try to convince investors before you've convinced yourself, you'll \\nbe wasting both your time.\\nBut pausing first to convince yourself will do more than save you from wasting your time. It will \\nforce you to organize your thoughts. To convince yourself that your startup is worth investing in, \\nyou'll have to figure out why it's worth investing in.

No one knows whether a startup is going to succeed. And it's a \\ngood thing for investors that this is so, because if you could know in advance whether a startup \\nwould succeed, the stock price would already be the future price, and there would be no room \\nfor investors to make money.

[8]\\nBut every company that gets really big is \"lucky\" in the sense that their growth is due mostly to \\nsome external wave they\\'re riding, so to make a convincing case for becoming huge, you have \\nto identify some specific trend you\\'ll benefit from.

I don\\'t know about startups in general, but at least half the startups we \\nfund could make as good a case as Microsoft could have for being on a path to dominating a \\nlarge market. And who can reasonably expect more of a startup than that?\\nRejection\\nIf you can make as good a case as Microsoft could have, will you convince investors? Not \\nalways. A lot of VCs would have rejected Microsoft. [9] Certainly some rejected Google. And \\ngetting rejected will put you in a slightly awkward position, because as you\\'ll see when you start \\nfundraising, the most common question you\\'ll get from investors will be \"who else is investing?\" \\nWhat do you say if you\\'ve been fundraising for a while and no one has committed yet?

[10]\\nThe people who are really good at acting formidable often solve this problem by giving investors \\nthe impression that while no investors have committed yet, several are about to. This is \\narguably a permissible tactic. It\\'s slightly dickish of investors to care more about who else is \\ninvesting than any other aspect of your startup, and misleading them about how far along you \\nare with other investors seems the complementary countermove. It\\'s arguably an instance of \\nscamming a scammer. But I don\\'t recommend this approach to most founders, because most \\nfounders wouldn\\'t be able to carry it off. This is the single most common lie told to investors, \\nand you have to be really good at lying to tell members of some profession the most common \\nlie they\\'re told.\\nIf you\\'re not a master of negotiation (and perhaps even if you are) the b', \"d to investors, \\nand you have to be really good at lying to tell members of some profession the most common \\nlie they're told.\\nIf you're not a master of negotiation (and perhaps even if you are) the best solution is to tackle \\nthe problem head-on, and to explain why investors have turned you down and why they're \\nmistaken. If you know you're on the right track, then you also know why investors were wrong to \\nreject you. Experienced investors are well aware that the best ideas are also the scariest. They \\nall know about the VCs who rejected Google. If instead of seeming evasive and ashamed about \\nhaving been turned down (and thereby implicitly agreeing with the verdict) you talk candidly \\nabout what scared investors about you, you'll seem more confident, which they like, and you'll \\nprobably also do a better job of presenting that aspect of your startup.

Raising money is not like applying to college, where you can assume that if you can get \\ninto MIT, you can also get into Foobar State. Because the best investors are much smarter than \\nthe rest, and the best startup ideas look initially like bad ideas, it's not uncommon for a startup \\nto be rejected by all the VCs except the best ones.

If you can work out a preliminary answer on the spot, so much \\nthe better, but explain that's what you're doing.\\n[7] At YC we try to ensure startups are ready to raise money on Demo Day by encouraging them to ignore investors \\nand instead focus on their companies till about a week before. That way most reach the stage where they're \\nsufficiently convincing well before Demo Day.

If anyone could have sat back and waited for users, it was Stripe. But in fact they\\'re \\nfamous within YC for aggressive early user acquisition.\\nStartups building things for other startups have a big pool of potential users in the other \\ncompanies we\\'ve funded, and none took better advantage of it than Stripe. At YC we use the \\nterm \"Collison installation\" for the technique they invented. More diffident founders ask \"Will you \\ntry our beta?\" and if the answer is yes, they say \"Great, we\\'ll send you a link.\" But the Collison \\nbrothers weren\\'t going to wait.

When anyone agreed to try Stripe they\\'d say \"Right then, give \\nme your laptop\" and set them up on the spot.\\nThere are two reasons founders resist going out and recruiting users individually. One is a \\ncombination of shyness and laziness. They\\'d rather sit at home writing code than go out and \\ntalk to a bunch of strangers and probably be rejected by most of them. But for a startup to \\nsucceed, at least one founder (usually the CEO) will have to spend a lot of time on sales and \\nmarketing. [2]\\nThe other reason founders ignore this path is that the absolute numbers seem so small at first. \\nThis can\\'t be how the big, famous startups got started, they think.

After a year you'll have 14,000 users, \\nand after 2 years you'll have 2 million.\\nYou'll be doing different things when you're acquiring users a thousand at a time, and growth \\nhas to slow down eventually. But if the market exists you can usually start by recruiting users \\nmanually and then gradually switch to less manual methods. [3]\\nAirbnb is a classic example of this technique.

Three reasons, I \\nthink.\\nOne is that a lot of startup founders are trained as engineers, and customer service is not part \\nof the training of engineers. You're supposed to build things that are robust and elegant, not be \\nslavishly attentive to individual users like some kind of salesperson.

But when founders of larval startups worry about this, I point out that in their current state \\nthey have nothing to lose. Maybe if they go out of their way to make existing users super happy, \\nthey'll one day have too many to do so much for. That would be a great problem to have. See if \\nyou can make it happen. And incidentally, when it does, you'll find that delighting customers \\nscales better than you expected.

Their standards for \\ncustomer service have been set by the companies they've been customers of, which are mostly \\nbig ones. Tim Cook doesn't send you a hand-written note after you buy a laptop. He can't. But \\nyou can. That's one advantage of being small: you can provide a level of service no big \\ncompany can. [6]\\nOnce you realize that existing conventions are not the upper bound on user experience, it's \\ninteresting in a very pleasant way to think about how far you could go to delight your users.\\nExperience\\nI was trying to think of a phrase to convey how extreme y\", 'upper bound on user experience, it\\'s \\ninteresting in a very pleasant way to think about how far you could go to delight your users.\\nExperience\\nI was trying to think of a phrase to convey how extreme your attention to users should be, and I \\nrealized Steve Jobs had already done it: insanely great.

Even if you start the way most successful startups have, by building something you \\nyourself need, the first thing you build is never quite right. And except in domains with big \\npenalties for making mistakes, it's often better not to aim for perfection initially. In software, \\nespecially, it usually works best to get something in front of users as soon as it has a quantum \\nof utility, and then see what they do with it. Perfectionism is often an excuse for procrastination, \\nand in any case your initial model of users is always inaccurate, even if you're one of them.

They build something for \\nthemselves and their friends, who happen to be the early adopters, and only realize later that \\nthey could offer it to a broader market.

That\\'s what Pebble did. The Pebbles assembled the first several hundred watches \\nthemselves. If they hadn\\'t gone through that phase, they probably wouldn\\'t have sold $10 \\nmillion worth of watches when they did go on Kickstarter.\\nLike paying excessive attention to early customers, fabricating things yourself turns out to be \\nvaluable for hardware startups. You can tweak the design faster when you\\'re the factory, and \\nyou learn things you\\'d never have known otherwise. Eric Migicovsky of Pebble said one of the \\nthings he learned was \"how valuable it was to source good screws.\" Who knew?\\nConsult\\nSometimes we advise founders of B2B startups to take over-engagement to an extreme, and to \\npick a single user and act as if they were consultants building something just for that one user. \\nThe initial user serves as the form for your mold; keep tweaking till you fit t', \"o an extreme, and to \\npick a single user and act as if they were consultants building something just for that one user. \\nThe initial user serves as the form for your mold; keep tweaking till you fit their needs perfectly, \\nand you'll usually find you've made something other users want too.

As long as you can find just one \\nuser who really needs something and can act on that need, you've got a toehold in making \\nsomething people want, and that's as much as any startup needs initially. [9]\\nConsulting is the canonical example of work that doesn't scale. But (like other ways of \\nbestowing one's favors liberally) it's safe to do it so long as you're not being paid to. That's \\nwhere companies cross the line. So long as you're a product company that's merely being extra \\nattentive to a customer, they're very grateful even if you don't solve all their problems.

But when \\nthey start paying you specifically for that attentiveness — when they start paying you by the \\nhour — they expect you to do everything.\\nAnother consulting-like technique for recruiting initially lukewarm users is to use your software \\nyourselves on their behalf. We did that at Viaweb. When we approached merchants asking if \\nthey wanted to use our software to make online stores, some said no, but they'd let us make \\none for them. Since we would do anything to get users, we did. We felt pretty lame at the time. \\nInstead of organizing big strategic e-commerce partnerships, we were trying to sell luggage and \\npens and men's shirts. But in retrospect it was exactly the right thing to do, because it taught us \\nhow it would feel to merchants to use our software.

Sometimes the feedback loop was near \\ninstantaneous: in the middle of building some merchant\\'s site I\\'d find I needed a feature we \\ndidn\\'t have, so I\\'d spend a couple hours implementing it and then resume building the site.\\nManual\\nThere\\'s a more extreme variant where you don\\'t just use your software, but are your software. \\nWhen you only have a small number of users, you can sometimes get away with doing by hand \\nthings that you plan to automate later. This lets you launch faster, and when you do finally \\nautomate yourself out of the loop, you\\'ll know exactly what to build because you\\'ll have muscle \\nmemory from doing it yourself.\\nWhen manual components look to the user like software, this technique starts to have aspects \\nof a practical joke. For example, the way Stripe delivered \"instant\" merchant accounts to its first \\nusers was that the founders manu', ' to the user like software, this technique starts to have aspects \\nof a practical joke. For example, the way Stripe delivered \"instant\" merchant accounts to its first \\nusers was that the founders manually signed them up for traditional merchant accounts behind \\nthe scenes.\\nSome startups could be entirely manual at first. If you can find someone with a problem that \\nneeds solving and you can solve it manually, go ahead and do that for as long as you can, and \\nthen gradually automate the bottlenecks. It would be a little frightening to be solving users\\' \\nproblems in a way that wasn\\'t yet automatic, but less frightening than the far more common \\ncase of having something automatic that doesn\\'t yet solve anyone\\'s problems.\\nBig\\nI should mention one sort of initial tactic that usually doesn\\'t work: the Big Launch.

I \\noccasionally meet founders who seem to believe startups are projectiles rather than powered \\naircraft, and that they'll make it big if and only if they're launched with sufficient initial velocity. \\nThey want to launch simultaneously in 8 different publications, with embargoes. And on a \\ntuesday, of course, since they read somewhere that's the optimum day to launch something.\\nIt's easy to see how little launches matter. Think of some successful startups. How many of their \\nlaunches do you remember? All you need from a launch is some initial core of users. How well \\nyou're doing a few months later will depend more on how happy you made those users than \\nhow many there were of them. [10]\\nSo why do founders think launches matter? A combination of solipsism and laziness. They think \\nwhat they're building is so great that everyone who hears about it will immediately sign up.

But even if what you're building really is great, getting \\nusers will always be a gradual process — partly because great things are usually also novel, \\nbut mainly because users have other things to think about.\\nPartnerships too usually don't work. They don't work for startups in general, but they especially \\ndon't work as a way to get growth started. It's a common mistake among inexperienced \\nfounders to believe that a partnership with a big company will be their big break. Six months \\nlater they're all saying the same thing: that was way more work than we expected, and we \\nended up getting practically nothing out of it.

Any strategy that omits the effort — whether it's expecting a big launch to get you \\nusers, or a big partner — is ipso facto suspect.\\nVector\\nThe need to do something unscalably laborious to get started is so nearly universal that it might \\nbe a good idea to stop thinking of startup ideas as scalars. Instead we should try thinking of \\nthem as pairs of what you're going to build, plus the unscalable thing(s) you're going to do \\ninitially to get the company going.\\nIt could be interesting to start viewing startup ideas this way, because now that there are two \\ncomponents you can try to be imaginative about the second as well as the first.

But in most \\ncases the second component will be what it usually is — recruit users manually and give them \\nan overwhelmingly good experience — and the main benefit of treating startups as vectors will \\nbe to remind founders they need to work hard in two dimensions. [12]\\nIn the best case, both components of the vector contribute to your company's DNA: the \\nunscalable things you have to do to get started are not merely a necessary evil, but change the \\ncompany permanently for the better. If you have to be aggressive about user acquisition when \\nyou're small, you'll probably still be aggressive when you're big. If you have to manufacture your \\nown hardware, or use your software on users's behalf, you'll learn things you couldn't have \\nlearned otherwise. And most importantly, if you have to work hard to delight users when you \\nonly have a handful of them, you'll keep doing it when you have a lot.\\nNotes:\\n[1] Actually Emerson never mentioned mousetraps\", ' And most importantly, if you have to work hard to delight users when you \\nonly have a handful of them, you\\'ll keep doing it when you have a lot.\\nNotes:\\n[1] Actually Emerson never mentioned mousetraps specifically.

The total \\nvaluation of the 287 that have valuations (either by raising an equity round, getting acquired, or \\ndying) is about $11.7 billion, and the 511 prior to the current batch have collectively raised \\nabout $1.7 billion. [1]\\nAs usual those numbers are dominated by a few big winners. The top 10 startups account for \\n8.6 of that 11.7 billion. But there is a peloton of younger startups behind them.

There are about \\n40 more that have a shot at being really big.\\nThings got a little out of hand last summer when we had 84 companies in the batch, so we \\ntightened up our filter to decrease the batch size. [2] Several journalists have tried to interpret \\nthat as evidence for some macro story they were telling, but the reason had nothing to do with \\nany external trend. The reason was that we discovered we were using an n² algorithm, and we \\nneeded to buy time to fix it. Fortunately we've come up with several techniques for sharding YC, \\nand the problem now seems to be fixed. With a new more scaleable model and only 53 \\ncompanies, the current batch feels like a walk in the park. I'd guess we can grow another 2 or \\n3x before hitting the next bottleneck. [3]\\nOne consequence of funding such a large number of startups is that we\", \"s, the current batch feels like a walk in the park. I'd guess we can grow another 2 or \\n3x before hitting the next bottleneck. [3]\\nOne consequence of funding such a large number of startups is that we see trends early. And \\nsince fundraising is one of the main things we help startups with, we're in a good position to \\nnotice trends in investing.\\nI'm going to take a shot at describing where these trends are leading. Let's start with the most \\nbasic question: will the future be better or worse than the past? Will investors, in the aggregate, \\nmake more money or less?\\nI think more. There are multiple forces at work, some of which will decrease returns, and some \\nof which will increase them. I can't predict for sure which forces will prevail, but I'll describe \\nthem and you can decide for yourself.\\nThere are two big forces driving change in startup funding: it's becoming cheaper to start a \\nstartup, and startups are becoming a more normal thing to do.\\nWhen I graduated from college in 1986,\", \"self.\\nThere are two big forces driving change in startup funding: it's becoming cheaper to start a \\nstartup, and startups are becoming a more normal thing to do.\\nWhen I graduated from college in 1986, there were essentially two options: get a job or go to \\ngrad school. Now there's a third: start your own company. That's a big change. In principle it \\nwas possible to start your own company in 1986 too, but it didn't seem like a real possibility. It \\nseemed possible to start a consulting company, or a niche product company, but it didn't seem \\npossible to start a company that would become big. [4]\\nThat kind of change, from 2 paths to 3, is the sort of big social shift that only happens once \\nevery few generations. I think we're still at the beginning of this one. It's hard to predict how big \\na deal it will be. As big a deal as the Industrial Revolution? Maybe. Probably not. But it will be a \\nbig enough deal that it takes almost everyone by surprise, because those big social shifts \\nalwa\", \" \\na deal it will be. As big a deal as the Industrial Revolution? Maybe. Probably not. But it will be a \\nbig enough deal that it takes almost everyone by surprise, because those big social shifts \\nalways do.\\nOne thing we can say for sure is that there will be a lot more startups. The monolithic, \\nhierarchical companies of the mid 20th century are being replaced by networks of smaller \\ncompanies. This process is not just something happening now in Silicon Valley. It started \\ndecades ago, and it's happening as far afield as the car industry. It has a long way to run. [5]\\nThe other big driver of change is that startups are becoming cheaper to start. And in fact the \\ntwo forces are related: the decreasing cost of starting a startup is one of the reasons startups \\nare becoming a more normal thing to do.\\nThe fact that startups need less money means founders will increasingly have the upper hand \\nover investors. You still need just as much of their energy and imagination, but they don't need \\n\", \"g to do.\\nThe fact that startups need less money means founders will increasingly have the upper hand \\nover investors. You still need just as much of their energy and imagination, but they don't need \\nas much of your money. Because founders have the upper hand, they'll retain an increasingly \\nlarge share of the stock in, and control of, their companies. Which means investors will get less \\nstock and less control.\\nDoes that mean investors will make less money? Not necessarily, because there will be more \\ngood startups. The total amount of desirable startup stock available to investors will probably \\nincrease, because the number of desirable startups will probably grow faster than the \\npercentage they sell to investors shrinks.\\nThere's a rule of thumb in the VC business that there are about 15 companies a year that will \\nbe really successful. Although a lot of investors unconsciously treat this number as if it were \\nsome sort of cosmological constant, I'm certain it isn't. There are proba\", \"5 companies a year that will \\nbe really successful. Although a lot of investors unconsciously treat this number as if it were \\nsome sort of cosmological constant, I'm certain it isn't. There are probably limits on the rate at \\nwhich technology can develop, but that's not the limiting factor now. If it were, each successful \\nstartup would be founded the month it became possible, and that is not the case. Right now the \\nlimiting factor on the number of big hits is the number of sufficiently good founders starting \\ncompanies, and that number can and will increase. There are still a lot of people who'd make \\ngreat founders who never end up starting a company. You can see that from how randomly \\nsome of the most successful startups got started. So many of the biggest startups almost didn't \\nhappen that there must be a lot of equally good startups that actually didn't happen.\\nThere might be 10x or even 50x more good founders out there. As more of them go ahead and \\nstart startups, those 15 b\", \"pen that there must be a lot of equally good startups that actually didn't happen.\\nThere might be 10x or even 50x more good founders out there. As more of them go ahead and \\nstart startups, those 15 big hits a year could easily become 50 or even 100. [6]\\nWhat about returns, though? Are we heading for a world in which returns will be pinched by \\nincreasingly high valuations? I think the top firms will actually make more money than they have \\nin the past. High returns don't come from investing at low valuations. They come from investing \\nin the companies that do really well. So if there are more of those to be had each year, the best \\npickers should have more hits.\\nThis means there should be more variability in the VC business. The firms that can recognize \\nand attract the best startups will do even better, because there will be more of them to \\nrecognize and attract. Whereas the bad firms will get the leftovers, as they do now, and yet pay \\na higher price for them.\\nNor do I think it wil\", \" do even better, because there will be more of them to \\nrecognize and attract. Whereas the bad firms will get the leftovers, as they do now, and yet pay \\na higher price for them.\\nNor do I think it will be a problem that founders keep control of their companies for longer. The \\nempirical evidence on that is already clear: investors make more money as founders' bitches \\nthan their bosses. Though somewhat humiliating, this is actually good news for investors, \\nbecause it takes less time to serve founders than to micromanage them.\\nWhat about angels? I think there is a lot of opportunity there. It used to suck to be an angel \\ninvestor. You couldn't get access to the best deals, unless you got lucky like Andy \\nBechtolsheim, and when you did invest in a startup, VCs might try to strip you of your stock \\nwhen they arrived later. Now an angel can go to something like Demo Day or AngelList and \\nhave access to the same deals VCs do. And the days when VCs could wash angels out of the \\ncap table ar\", \" stock \\nwhen they arrived later. Now an angel can go to something like Demo Day or AngelList and \\nhave access to the same deals VCs do. And the days when VCs could wash angels out of the \\ncap table are long gone.\\nI think one of the biggest unexploited opportunities in startup investing right now is angel-sized \\ninvestments made quickly. Few investors understand the cost that raising money from them \\nimposes on startups. When the company consists only of the founders, everything grinds to a \\nhalt during fundraising, which can easily take 6 weeks. The current high cost of fundraising \\nmeans there is room for low-cost investors to undercut the rest. And in this context, low-cost \\nmeans deciding quickly. If there were a reputable investor who invested $100k on good terms \\nand promised to decide yes or no within 24 hours, they'd get access to almost all the best \\ndeals, because every good startup would approach them first. It would be up to them to pick, \\nbecause every bad startup would app\", \"e yes or no within 24 hours, they'd get access to almost all the best \\ndeals, because every good startup would approach them first. It would be up to them to pick, \\nbecause every bad startup would approach them first too, but at least they'd see everything. \\nWhereas if an investor is notorious for taking a long time to make up their mind or negotiating a \\nlot about valuation, founders will save them for last. And in the case of the most promising \\nstartups, which tend to have an easy time raising money, last can easily become never.\\nWill the number of big hits grow linearly with the total number of new startups? Probably not, for \\ntwo reasons. One is that the scariness of starting a startup in the old days was a pretty effective \\nfilter. Now that the cost of failing is becoming lower, we should expect founders to do it more. \\nThat's not a bad thing. It's common in technology for an innovation that decreases the cost of \\nfailure to increase the number of failures and yet leave you net a\", \"hould expect founders to do it more. \\nThat's not a bad thing. It's common in technology for an innovation that decreases the cost of \\nfailure to increase the number of failures and yet leave you net ahead.\\nThe other reason the number of big hits won't grow proportionately to the number of startups is \\nthat there will start to be an increasing number of idea clashes. Although the finiteness of the \\nnumber of good ideas is not the reason there are only 15 big hits a year, the number has to be \\nfinite, and the more startups there are, the more we'll see multiple companies doing the same \\nthing at the same time. It will be interesting, in a bad way, if idea clashes become a lot more \\ncommon. [7]\\nMostly because of the increasing number of early failures, the startup business of the future \\nwon't simply be the same shape, scaled up. What used to be an obelisk will become a pyramid. \\nIt will be a little wider at the top, but a lot wider at the bottom.\\nWhat does that mean for investors? One th\", \"t simply be the same shape, scaled up. What used to be an obelisk will become a pyramid. \\nIt will be a little wider at the top, but a lot wider at the bottom.\\nWhat does that mean for investors? One thing it means is that there will be more opportunities \\nfor investors at the earliest stage, because that's where the volume of our imaginary solid is \\ngrowing fastest. Imagine the obelisk of investors that corresponds to the obelisk of startups. As \\nit widens out into a pyramid to match the startup pyramid, all the contents are adhering to the \\ntop, leaving a vacuum at the bottom.\\nThat opportunity for investors mostly means an opportunity for new investors, because the \\ndegree of risk an existing investor or firm is comfortable taking is one of the hardest things for \\nthem to change. Different types of investors are adapted to different degrees of risk, but each \\nhas its specific degree of risk deeply imprinted on it, not just in the procedures they follow but in \\nthe personalities of the \", ' types of investors are adapted to different degrees of risk, but each \\nhas its specific degree of risk deeply imprinted on it, not just in the procedures they follow but in \\nthe personalities of the people who work there.\\nI think the biggest danger for VCs, and also the biggest opportunity, is at the series A stage. Or \\nrather, what used to be the series A stage before series As turned into de facto series B rounds.\\nRight now, VCs often knowingly invest too much money at the series A stage. They do it \\nbecause they feel they need to get a big chunk of each series A company to compensate for \\nthe opportunity cost of the board seat it consumes. Which means when there is a lot of \\ncompetition for a deal, the number that moves is the valuation (and thus amount invested) \\nrather than the percentage of the company being sold. Which means, especially in the case of \\nmore promising startups, that series A investors often make companies take more money than \\nthey want.\\nSome VCs lie and claim t', \"ntage of the company being sold. Which means, especially in the case of \\nmore promising startups, that series A investors often make companies take more money than \\nthey want.\\nSome VCs lie and claim the company really needs that much. Others are more candid, and \\nadmit their financial models require them to own a certain percentage of each company. But we \\nall know the amounts being raised in series A rounds are not determined by asking what would \\nbe best for the companies. They're determined by VCs starting from the amount of the \\ncompany they want to own, and the market setting the valuation and thus the amount invested.\\nLike a lot of bad things, this didn't happen intentionally. The VC business backed into it as their \\ninitial assumptions gradually became obsolete. The traditions and financial models of the VC \\nbusiness were established when founders needed investors more. In those days it was natural \\nfor founders to sell VCs a big chunk of their company in the series A round. Now\", 'inancial models of the VC \\nbusiness were established when founders needed investors more. In those days it was natural \\nfor founders to sell VCs a big chunk of their company in the series A round. Now founders \\nwould prefer to sell less, and VCs are digging in their heels because they\\'re not sure if they can \\nmake money buying less than 20% of each series A company.\\nThe reason I describe this as a danger is that series A investors are increasingly at odds with \\nthe startups they supposedly serve, and that tends to come back to bite you eventually. The \\nreason I describe it as an opportunity is that there is now a lot of potential energy built up, as \\nthe market has moved away from VCs\\' traditional business model. Which means the first VC to \\nbreak ranks and start to do series A rounds for as much equity as founders want to sell (and \\nwith no \"option pool\" that comes only from the founders\\' shares) stands to reap huge benefits.\\nWhat will happen to the VC business when that happens? Hell', 'as much equity as founders want to sell (and \\nwith no \"option pool\" that comes only from the founders\\' shares) stands to reap huge benefits.\\nWhat will happen to the VC business when that happens? Hell if I know. But I bet that particular \\nfirm will end up ahead. If one top-tier VC firm started to do series A rounds that started from the \\namount the company needed to raise and let the percentage acquired vary with the market, \\ninstead of the other way around, they\\'d instantly get almost all the best startups. And that\\'s \\nwhere the money is.\\nYou can\\'t fight market forces forever. Over the last decade we\\'ve seen the percentage of the \\ncompany sold in series A rounds creep inexorably downward. 40% used to be common. Now \\nVCs are fighting to hold the line at 20%.

Venture capital is a business where occasional big successes generate \\nhundredfold returns. How much confidence can you really have in financial models for \\nsomething like that anyway? The big successes only have to get a tiny bit less occasional to \\ncompensate for a 2x decrease in the stock sold in series A rounds.\\nIf you want to find new opportunities for investing, look for things founders complain about. \\nFounders are your customers, and the things they complain about are unsatisfied demand.

Get funded by Y Combinator. \\n November 2012\\nThe way to get startup ideas is not to try to think of startup ideas. It's to look for problems, \\npreferably problems you have yourself.\\nThe very best startup ideas tend to have three things in common: they're something the \\nfounders themselves want, that they themselves can build, and that few others realize are worth \\ndoing. Microsoft, Apple, Yahoo, Google, and Facebook all began this way.\\nProblems\\nWhy is it so important to work on a problem you have? Among other things, it ensures the \\nproblem really exists.

Among other things, it ensures the \\nproblem really exists. It sounds obvious to say you should only work on problems that exist. And \\nyet by far the most common mistake startups make is to solve problems no one has.\\nI made it myself. In 1995 I started a company to put art galleries online. But galleries didn't want \\nto be online. It's not how the art business works. So why did I spend 6 months working on this \\nstupid idea? Because I didn't pay attention to users. I invented a model of the world that didn't \\ncorrespond to reality, and worked from that. I didn't notice my model was wrong until I tried to \\nconvince users to pay for what we'd built. Even then I took embarrassingly long to catch on. I \\nwas attached to my model of the world, and I'd spent a lot of time on the software. They had to \\nwant it!\\nWhy do so many founders build things no one wants?

They had to \\nwant it!\\nWhy do so many founders build things no one wants? Because they begin by trying to think of \\nstartup ideas. That m.o. is doubly dangerous: it doesn\\'t merely yield few good ideas; it yields \\nbad ideas that sound plausible enough to fool you into working on them.\\nAt YC we call these \"made-up\" or \"sitcom\" startup ideas. Imagine one of the characters on a TV \\nshow was starting a startup. The writers would have to invent something for it to do. But coming \\nup with good startup ideas is hard. It\\'s not something you can do for the asking. So (unless they \\ngot amazingly lucky) the writers would come up with an idea that sounded plausible, but was \\nactually bad.\\nFor example, a social network for pet owners. It doesn\\'t sound obviously mistaken. Millions of \\npeople have pets. Often they care a lot about their pets and spend a lot of money on them. \\nSurely many of these people would like a ', ' for pet owners. It doesn\\'t sound obviously mistaken. Millions of \\npeople have pets. Often they care a lot about their pets and spend a lot of money on them. \\nSurely many of these people would like a site where they could talk to other pet owners. Not all \\nof them perhaps, but if just 2 or 3 percent were regular visitors, you could have millions of users. \\nYou could serve them targeted offers, and maybe charge for premium features. [1]\\nThe danger of an idea like this is that when you run it by your friends with pets, they don\\'t say \"I \\nwould never use this.\" They say \"Yeah, maybe I could see using something like that.\" Even \\nwhen the startup launches, it will sound plausible to a lot of people. They don\\'t want to use it \\nthemselves, at least not right now, but they could imagine other people wanting it. Sum that \\nreaction across the entire population, and you have zero users. [2]\\nWell\\nWhen a startup launches, there have to be at least some users who really need what they\\'re \\nmaking — n', \"le wanting it. Sum that \\nreaction across the entire population, and you have zero users. [2]\\nWell\\nWhen a startup launches, there have to be at least some users who really need what they're \\nmaking — not just people who could see themselves using it one day, but who want it urgently. \\nUsually this initial group of users is small, for the simple reason that if there were something \\nthat large numbers of people urgently needed and that could be built with the amount of effort a \\nstartup usually puts into a version one, it would probably already exist. Which means you have \\nto compromise on one dimension: you can either build something a large number of people \\nwant a small amount, or something a small number of people want a large amount. Choose the \\nlatter. Not all ideas of that type are good startup ideas, but nearly all good startup ideas are of \\nthat type.\\nImagine a graph whose x axis represents all the people who might want what you're making \\nand whose y axis represents how much the\", \"d startup ideas, but nearly all good startup ideas are of \\nthat type.\\nImagine a graph whose x axis represents all the people who might want what you're making \\nand whose y axis represents how much they want it. If you invert the scale on the y axis, you \\ncan envision companies as holes. Google is an immense crater: hundreds of millions of people \\nuse it, and they need it a lot. A startup just starting out can't expect to excavate that much \\nvolume. So you have two choices about the shape of hole you start with. You can either dig a \\nhole that's broad but shallow, or one that's narrow and deep, like a well.\\nMade-up startup ideas are usually of the first type. Lots of people are mildly interested in a \\nsocial network for pet owners.\\nNearly all good startup ideas are of the second type. Microsoft was a well when they made \\nAltair Basic. There were only a couple thousand Altair owners, but without this software they \\nwere programming in machine language.

Thirty years later Facebook had the same shape. \\nTheir first site was exclusively for Harvard students, of which there are only a few thousand, but \\nthose few thousand users wanted it a lot.\\nWhen you have an idea for a startup, ask yourself: who wants this right now? Who wants this so \\nmuch that they'll use it even when it's a crappy version one made by a two-person startup \\nthey've never heard of? If you can't answer that, the idea is probably bad. [3]\\nYou don't need the narrowness of the well per se. It's depth you need; you get narrowness as a \\nbyproduct of optimizing for depth (and speed). But you almost always do get it. In practice the \\nlink between depth and narrowness is so strong that it's a good sign when you know that an \\nidea will appeal strongly to a specific group or type of user.\\nBut while demand shaped like \", \"n practice the \\nlink between depth and narrowness is so strong that it's a good sign when you know that an \\nidea will appeal strongly to a specific group or type of user.\\nBut while demand shaped like a well is almost a necessary condition for a good startup idea, \\nit's not a sufficient one. If Mark Zuckerberg had built something that could only ever have \\nappealed to Harvard students, it would not have been a good startup idea. Facebook was a \\ngood idea because it started with a small market there was a fast path out of. Colleges are \\nsimilar enough that if you build a facebook that works at Harvard, it will work at any college. So \\nyou spread rapidly through all the colleges. Once you have all the college students, you get \\neveryone else simply by letting them in.\\nSimilarly for Microsoft: Basic for the Altair; Basic for other machines; other languages besides \\nBasic; operating systems; applications; IPO.\\nSelf\\nHow do you tell whether there's a path out of an idea?

How do you tell whether something is \\nthe germ of a giant company, or just a niche product? Often you can't. The founders of Airbnb \\ndidn't realize at first how big a market they were tapping. Initially they had a much narrower \\nidea. They were going to let hosts rent out space on their floors during conventions. They didn't \\nforesee the expansion of this idea; it forced itself upon them gradually. All they knew at first is \\nthat they were onto something. That's probably as much as Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg knew \\nat first.\\nOccasionally it's obvious from the beginning when there's a path out of the initial niche. And \\nsometimes I can see a path that's not immediately obvious; that's one of our specialties at YC. \\nBut there are limits to how well this can be done, no matter how much experience you have. \\nThe\", \"e.

The truth is disappointing but interesting: if you're the right sort of person, you have the \\nright sort of hunches. If you're at the leading edge of a field that's changing fast, when you have \\na hunch that something is worth doing, you're more likely to be right.\\nIn Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, Robert Pirsig says: You want to know how to \\npaint a perfect painting?

I\\'ve \\nwondered about that passage since I read it in high school. I\\'m not sure how useful his advice is \\nfor painting specifically, but it fits this situation well. Empirically, the way to have good startup \\nideas is to become the sort of person who has them.\\nBeing at the leading edge of a field doesn\\'t mean you have to be one of the people pushing it \\nforward. You can also be at the leading edge as a user. It was not so much because he was a \\nprogrammer that Facebook seemed a good idea to Mark Zuckerberg as because he used \\ncomputers so much. If you\\'d asked most 40 year olds in 2004 whether they\\'d like to publish their \\nlives semi-publicly on the Internet, they\\'d have been horrified at the idea. But Mark already lived \\nonline; to him it seemed natural.\\nPaul Buchheit says that people at the leading edge of a rapidly changing field \"live in the \\nfuture.\" Combine that with Pirsig and you get: Live in the future, then build wha', 'to him it seemed natural.\\nPaul Buchheit says that people at the leading edge of a rapidly changing field \"live in the \\nfuture.\" Combine that with Pirsig and you get: Live in the future, then build what\\'s missing. That \\ndescribes the way many if not most of the biggest startups got started. Neither Apple nor Yahoo \\nnor Google nor Facebook were even supposed to be companies at first. They grew out of things \\ntheir founders built because there seemed a gap in the world.\\nIf you look at the way successful founders have had their ideas, it\\'s generally the result of some \\nexternal stimulus hitting a prepared mind. Bill Gates and Paul Allen hear about the Altair and \\nthink \"I bet we could write a Basic interpreter for it.\" Drew Houston realizes he\\'s forgotten his \\nUSB stick and thinks \"I really need to make my files live online.\" Lots of people heard about the \\nAltair.

Lots forgot USB sticks. The reason those stimuli caused those founders to start \\ncompanies was that their experiences had prepared them to notice the opportunities they \\nrepresented.\\nThe verb you want to be using with respect to startup ideas is not \"think up\" but \"notice.\" At YC \\nwe call ideas that grow naturally out of the founders\\' own experiences \"organic\" startup ideas. \\nThe most successful startups almost all begin this way.\\nThat may not have been what you wanted to hear. You may have expected recipes for coming \\nup with startup ideas, and instead I\\'m telling you that the key is to have a mind that\\'s prepared \\nin the right way. But disappointing though it may be, this is the truth.

For \\nexample, anyone reasonably smart can probably get to an edge of programming (e.g. building \\nmobile apps) in a year. Since a successful startup will consume at least 3-5 years of your life, a \\nyear's preparation would be a reasonable investment. Especially if you're also looking for a \\ncofounder. [4]\\nYou don't have to learn programming to be at the leading edge of a domain that's changing fast. \\nOther domains change fast. But while learning to hack is not necessary, it is for the forseeable \\nfuture sufficient. As Marc Andreessen put it, software is eating the world, and this trend has \\ndecades left to run.\\nKnowing how to hack also means that when you have ideas, you'll be able to implement them. \\nThat's not absolutely necessary (Jeff Bezos couldn't) but it's an advantage.

I\\'ll try \\nbuilding an initial version tonight.\" It\\'s even better when you\\'re both a programmer and the \\ntarget user, because then the cycle of generating new versions and testing them on users can \\nhappen inside one head.\\nNoticing\\nOnce you\\'re living in the future in some respect, the way to notice startup ideas is to look for \\nthings that seem to be missing. If you\\'re really at the leading edge of a rapidly changing field, \\nthere will be things that are obviously missing. What won\\'t be obvious is that they\\'re startup \\nideas. So if you want to find startup ideas, don\\'t merely turn on the filter \"What\\'s missing?\" Also \\nturn off every other filt', 'hat are obviously missing. What won\\'t be obvious is that they\\'re startup \\nideas. So if you want to find startup ideas, don\\'t merely turn on the filter \"What\\'s missing?\" Also \\nturn off every other filter, particularly \"Could this be a big company?\" There\\'s plenty of time to \\napply that test later. But if you\\'re thinking about that initially, it may not only filter out lots of good \\nideas, but also cause you to focus on bad ones.\\nMost things that are missing will take some time to see. You almost have to trick yourself into \\nseeing the ideas around you.\\nBut you know the ideas are out there. This is not one of those problems where there might not \\nbe an answer. It\\'s impossibly unlikely that this is the exact moment when technological progress \\nstops. You can be sure people are going to build things in the next few years that will make you \\nthink \"What did I do before x?\"\\nAnd when these problems get solved, they will probably seem flamingly obvious in retrospect. \\nWhat you need to do is tu', 'things in the next few years that will make you \\nthink \"What did I do before x?\"\\nAnd when these problems get solved, they will probably seem flamingly obvious in retrospect. \\nWhat you need to do is turn off the filters that usually prevent you from seeing them. The most \\npowerful is simply taking the current state of the world for granted. Even the most radically open-\\nminded of us mostly do that. You couldn\\'t get from your bed to the front door if you stopped to \\nquestion everything.\\nBut if you\\'re looking for startup ideas you can sacrifice some of the efficiency of taking the \\nstatus quo for granted and start to question things. Why is your inbox overflowing? Because you \\nget a lot of email, or because it\\'s hard to get email out of your inbox? Why do you get so much \\nemail? What problems are people trying to solve by sending you email? Are there better ways \\nto solve them? And why is it hard to get emails out of your inbox? Why do you keep emails \\naround after you\\'ve read them? Is an', \" are people trying to solve by sending you email? Are there better ways \\nto solve them? And why is it hard to get emails out of your inbox? Why do you keep emails \\naround after you've read them? Is an inbox the optimal tool for that?\\nPay particular attention to things that chafe you. The advantage of taking the status quo for \\ngranted is not just that it makes life (locally) more efficient, but also that it makes life more \\ntolerable. If you knew about all the things we'll get in the next 50 years but don't have yet, you'd \\nfind present day life pretty constraining, just as someone from the present would if they were \\nsent back 50 years in a time machine. When something annoys you, it could be because you're \\nliving in the future.\\nWhen you find the right sort of problem, you should probably be able to describe it as obvious, \\nat least to you.

[5]\\nWhich means, strangely enough, that coming up with startup ideas is a question of seeing the \\nobvious. That suggests how weird this process is: you're trying to see things that are obvious, \\nand yet that you hadn't seen.\\nSince what you need to do here is loosen up your own mind, it may be best not to make too \\nmuch of a direct frontal attack on the problem — i.e. to sit down and try to think of ideas. The \\nbest plan may be just to keep a background process running, looking for things that seem to be \\nmissing. Work on hard problems, driven mainly by curiosity, but have a second self watching \\nover your shoulder, taking note of gaps and anomalies. [6]\\nGive yourself some time.

If Bill \\nGates and Paul Allen had constrained themselves to come up with a startup idea in one month, \\nwhat if they'd chosen a month before the Altair appeared? They probably would have worked \\non a less promising idea. Drew Houston did work on a less promising idea before Dropbox: an \\nSAT prep startup. But Dropbox was a much better idea, both in the absolute sense and also as \\na match for his skills. [7]\\nA good way to trick yourself into noticing ideas is to work on projects that seem like they'd be \\ncool. If you do that, you'll naturally tend to build things that are missing.

When something is described as a toy, that \\nmeans it has everything an idea needs except being important. It\\'s cool; users love it; it just \\ndoesn\\'t matter. But if you\\'re living in the future and you build something cool that users love, it \\nmay matter more than outsiders think. Microcomputers seemed like toys when Apple and \\nMicrosoft started working on them. I\\'m old enough to remember that era; the usual term for \\npeople with their own microcomputers was \"hobbyists.\" BackRub seemed like an \\ninconsequential science project.

The examples \\nof the most successful founders make that clear. What you should be spending your time on in \\ncollege is ratcheting yourself into the future. College is an incomparable opportunity to do that. \\nWhat a waste to sacrifice an opportunity to solve the hard part of starting a startup — becoming \\nthe sort of ', \" ratcheting yourself into the future.

Especially since you won't even really learn about it, any more than you'd learn about \\nsex in a class. All you'll learn is the words for things.\\nThe clash of domains is a particularly fruitful source of ideas. If you know a lot about \\nprogramming and you start learning about some other field, you'll probably see problems that \\nsoftware could solve. In fact, you're doubly likely to find good problems in another domain: (a) \\nthe inhabitants of that domain are not as likely as software people to have already solved their \\nproblems with software, and (b) since you come into the new domain totally ignorant, you don't \\neven know what the status quo is to take it for granted.\\nSo if you're a CS major and y\", \"ady solved their \\nproblems with software, and (b) since you come into the new domain totally ignorant, you don't \\neven know what the status quo is to take it for granted.\\nSo if you're a CS major and you want to start a startup, instead of taking a class on \\nentrepreneurship you're better off taking a class on, say, genetics. Or better still, go work for a \\nbiotech company. CS majors normally get summer jobs at computer hardware or software \\ncompanies. But if you want to find startup ideas, you might do better to get a summer job in \\nsome unrelated field. [8]\\nOr don't take any extra classes, and just build things. It's no coincidence that Microsoft and \\nFacebook both got started in January. At Harvard that is (or was) Reading Period, when \\nstudents have no classes to attend because they're supposed to be studying for finals. [9]\\nBut don't feel like you have to build things that will become startups. That's premature \\noptimization. Just build things. Preferably with other students.

You're also surrounded by other \\npeople trying to do the same thing. If you work together with them on projects, you'll end up \\nproducing not just organic ideas, but organic ideas with organic founding teams — and that, \\nempirically, is the best combination.\\nBeware of research. If an undergrad writes something all his friends start using, it's quite likely \\nto represent a good startup idea. Whereas a PhD dissertation is extremely unlikely to. For some \\nreason, the more a project has to count as research, the less likely it is to be something that \\ncould be turned into a startup. [10] I think the reason is that the subset of ideas that count as \\nresearch is so narrow that it's unlikely that a pr\", \"earch, the less likely it is to be something that \\ncould be turned into a startup. [10] I think the reason is that the subset of ideas that count as \\nresearch is so narrow that it's unlikely that a project that satisfied that constraint would also \\nsatisfy the orthogonal constraint of solving users' problems. Whereas when students (or \\nprofessors) build something as a side-project, they automatically gravitate toward solving users' \\nproblems — perhaps even with an additional energy that comes from being freed from the \\nconstraints of research.\\nCompetition\\nBecause a good idea should seem obvious, when you have one you'll tend to feel that you're \\nlate. Don't let that deter you. Worrying that you're late is one of the signs of a good idea. Ten \\nminutes of searching the web will usually settle the question. Even if you find someone else \\nworking on the same thing, you're probably not too late. It's exceptionally rare for startups to be \\nkilled by competitors — so rare that you can almost \", \"e the question. Even if you find someone else \\nworking on the same thing, you're probably not too late. It's exceptionally rare for startups to be \\nkilled by competitors — so rare that you can almost discount the possibility. So unless you \\ndiscover a competitor with the sort of lock-in that would prevent users from choosing you, don't \\ndiscard the idea.\\nIf you're uncertain, ask users. The question of whether you're too late is subsumed by the \\nquestion of whether anyone urgently needs what you plan to make. If you have something that \\nno competitor does and that some subset of users urgently need, you have a beachhead. [11]\\nThe question then is whether that beachhead is big enough. Or more importantly, who's in it: if \\nthe beachhead consists of people doing something lots more people will be doing in the future, \\nthen it's probably big enough no matter how small it is. For example, if you're building \\nsomething differentiated from competitors by the fact that it works on phones, but i\", ' be doing in the future, \\nthen it\\'s probably big enough no matter how small it is. For example, if you\\'re building \\nsomething differentiated from competitors by the fact that it works on phones, but it only works \\non the newest phones, that\\'s probably a big enough beachhead.\\nErr on the side of doing things where you\\'ll face competitors. Inexperienced founders usually \\ngive competitors more credit than they deserve. Whether you succeed depends far more on you \\nthan on your competitors. So better a good idea with competitors than a bad one without.\\nYou don\\'t need to worry about entering a \"crowded market\" so long as you have a thesis about \\nwhat everyone else in it is overlooking. In fact that\\'s a very promising starting point. Google was \\nthat type of idea. Your thesis has to be more precise than \"we\\'re going to make an x that doesn\\'t \\nsuck\" though. You have to be able to phrase it in terms of something the incumbents are \\noverlooking. Best of all is when you can say that they didn\\'t ha', 'e than \"we\\'re going to make an x that doesn\\'t \\nsuck\" though.

Google was that type of idea too. The search engines that preceded them shied away \\nfrom the most radical implications of what they were doing — particularly that the better a job \\nthey did, the faster users would leave.\\nA crowded market is actually a good sign, because it means both that there\\'s demand and that \\nnone of the existing solutions are good enough. A startup can\\'t hope to enter a market that\\'s \\nobviously big and yet in which they have no competitors.

[12]\\nFilters\\nThere are two more filters you'll need to turn off if you want to notice startup ideas: the unsexy \\nfilter and the schlep filter.\\nMost programmers wish they could start a startup by just writing some brilliant code, pushing it \\nto a server, and having users pay them lots of money. They'd prefer not to deal with tedious \\nproblems or get involved in messy ways with the real world. Which is a reasonable preference, \\nbecause such things slow you down. But this preference is so widespread that the space of \\nconvenient startup ideas has been stripped pretty clean. If you let your mind wander a few \\nblocks down the street to the messy, tedious ideas, you'll find valuable ones just sitting there \\nwaiting to be impl\", \"nt startup ideas has been stripped pretty clean. If you let your mind wander a few \\nblocks down the street to the messy, tedious ideas, you'll find valuable ones just sitting there \\nwaiting to be implemented.\\nThe schlep filter is so dangerous that I wrote a separate essay about the condition it induces, \\nwhich I called schlep blindness. I gave Stripe as an example of a startup that benefited from \\nturning off this filter, and a pretty striking example it is. Thousands of programmers were in a \\nposition to see this idea; thousands of programmers knew how painful it was to process \\npayments before Stripe. But when they looked for startup ideas they didn't see this one, \\nbecause unconsciously they shrank from having to deal with payments. And dealing with \\npayments is a schlep for Stripe, but not an intolerable one. In fact they might have had net less \\npain; because the fear of dealing with payments kept most people away from this idea, Stripe \\nhas had comparatively smooth sailing in oth\", \" not an intolerable one. In fact they might have had net less \\npain; because the fear of dealing with payments kept most people away from this idea, Stripe \\nhas had comparatively smooth sailing in other areas that are sometimes painful, like user \\nacquisition. They didn't have to try very hard to make themselves heard by users, because \\nusers were desperately waiting for what they were building.\\nThe unsexy filter is similar to the schlep filter, except it keeps you from working on problems you \\ndespise rather than ones you fear. We overcame this one to work on Viaweb. There were \\ninteresting things about the architecture of our software, but we weren't interested in \\necommerce per se. We could see the problem was one that needed to be solved though.\\nTurning off the schlep filter is more important than turning off the unsexy filter, because the \\nschlep filter is more likely to be an illusion. And even to the degree it isn't, it's a worse form of \\nself-indulgence. Starting a successful s\", \"portant than turning off the unsexy filter, because the \\nschlep filter is more likely to be an illusion. And even to the degree it isn't, it's a worse form of \\nself-indulgence. Starting a successful startup is going to be fairly laborious no matter what. \\nEven if the product doesn't entail a lot of schleps, you'll still have plenty dealing with investors, \\nhiring and firing people, and so on. So if there's some idea you think would be cool but you're \\nkept away from by fear of the schleps involved, don't worry: any sufficiently good idea will have \\nas many.\\nThe unsexy filter, while still a source of error, is not as entirely useless as the schlep filter. If \\nyou're at the leading edge of a field that's changing rapidly, your ideas about what's sexy will be \\nsomewhat correlated with what's valuable in practice. Particularly as you get older and more \\nexperienced. Plus if you find an idea sexy, you'll work on it more enthusiastically.

Organic ideas feel like inspirations. There are a lot of stories about successful startups \\nthat began when the founders had what seemed a crazy idea but \"just knew\" it was promising. \\nWhen you feel that about an idea you\\'ve had while trying to come up with startup ideas, you\\'re \\nprobably mistaken.\\nWhen searching for ideas, look in areas where you have some expertise. If you\\'re a database \\nexpert, don\\'t build a chat app for teenagers (unless you\\'re also a teenager). Maybe it\\'s a good \\nidea, but you can\\'t trust your judgment about that, so ignore it. There have to be other ideas that \\ninvolve databases, and whose quality you can judge. Do you find it hard to come up with good \\nidea', '\\nidea, but you can\\'t trust your judgment about that, so ignore it. There have to be other ideas that \\ninvolve databases, and whose quality you can judge. Do you find it hard to come up with good \\nideas involving databases? That\\'s because your expertise raises your standards. Your ideas \\nabout chat apps are just as bad, but you\\'re giving yourself a Dunning-Kruger pass in that \\ndomain.\\nThe place to start looking for ideas is things you need. There must be things you need. [14]\\nOne good trick is to ask yourself whether in your previous job you ever found yourself saying \\n\"Why doesn\\'t someone make x? If someone made x we\\'d buy it in a second.\" If you can think of \\nany x people said that about, you probably have an idea. You know there\\'s demand, and people \\ndon\\'t say that about things that are impossible to build.\\nMore generally, try asking yourself whether there\\'s something unusual about you that makes \\nyour needs different from most other people\\'s. You\\'re probably not the only one. It\\'s e', \"impossible to build.\\nMore generally, try asking yourself whether there's something unusual about you that makes \\nyour needs different from most other people's.

It's especially \\ngood if you're different in a way people will increasingly be.\\nIf you're changing ideas, one unusual thing about you is the idea you'd previously been working \\non. Did you discover any needs while working on it? Several well-known startups began this \\nway. Hotmail began as something its founders wrote to talk about their previous startup idea \\nwhile they were working at their day jobs. [15]\\nA particularly promising way to be unusual is to be young. Some of the most valuable new ideas \\ntake root first among people in their teens and early twenties. And while young founders are at \\na disadvantage in some respects, they're the only ones who really understand their peers. It \\nwould have been very hard for someone who wasn't a college student to start Facebook.

So if \\nyou're a young founder (under 23 say), are there things you and your friends would like to do \\nthat current technology won't let you?\\nThe next best thing to an unmet need of your own is an unmet need of someone else. Try \\ntalking to everyone you can about the gaps they find in the world. What's missing? What would \\nthey like to do that they can't? What's tedious or annoying, particularly in their work? Let the \\nconversation get general; don't be trying too hard to find startup ideas. You're just looking for \\nsomething to spark a thought. Maybe you'll notice a problem they didn't consciously realize they \\nhad, because you know how to solve it.\\nWhen you find an unmet need that isn't your own, it may be somewhat blurry at first.

In that case I often \\nrecommend that founders act like consultants — that they do what they'd do if they'd been \\nretained to solve the problems of this one user. People's problems are similar enough that \\nnearly all the code you write this way will be reusable, and whatever isn't will be a small price to \\nstart out certain that you've reached the bottom of the well. [16]\\nOne way to ensure you do a good job solving other people's problems is to make them your \\nown. When Rajat Suri of E la Carte decided to write software for restaurants, he got a job as a \\nwaiter to learn how restaurants worked. That may seem like taking things to extremes, but \\nstartups are extreme. We love it when founders do such things.\\nIn fact, one strategy I recommend to people who need a new idea is not merely to turn off their\", \"seem like taking things to extremes, but \\nstartups are extreme. We love it when founders do such things.\\nIn fact, one strategy I recommend to people who need a new idea is not merely to turn off their \\nschlep and unsexy filters, but to seek out ideas that are unsexy or involve schleps. Don't try to \\nstart Twitter. Those ideas are so rare that you can't find them by looking for them. Make \\nsomething unsexy that people will pay you for.\\nA good trick for bypassing the schlep and to some extent the unsexy filter is to ask what you \\nwish someone else would build, so that you could use it. What would you pay for right now?\\nSince startups often garbage-collect broken companies and industries, it can be a good trick to \\nlook for those that are dying, or deserve to, and try to imagine what kind of company would \\nprofit from their demise.

When one company or industry replaces another, \\nit usually comes in from the side. So don\\'t look for a replacement for x; look for something that \\npeople will later say turned out to be a replacement for x. And be imaginative about the axis \\nalong which the replacement occurs. Traditional journalism, for example, is a way for readers to \\nget information and to kill time, a way for writers to make money and to get attention, and a \\nvehicle for several different types of advertising.

It\\'s particularly good if there\\'s an admixture of disdain in the \\nbig players\\' attitude, because that often misleads them. For example, after Steve Wozniak built \\nthe computer that became the Apple I, he felt obliged to give his then-employer Hewlett-\\nPackard the option to produce it. Fortunately for him, they turned it down, and one of the \\nreasons they did was that it used a TV for a monitor, which seemed intolerably dÿýclassÿý to a high-\\nend hardware company like HP was at the time. [17]\\nAre there groups of scruffy but sophisticated users like the early microcomputer \"hobbyists\" that \\nare currently being ignored by the big players?

The prices \\nof gene sequencing and 3D printing are both experiencing Moore\\'s Law-like declines. What new \\nthings will we be able to do in the new world we\\'ll have in a few years?

It was common in the 1990s, except then people who \\nhad it used to say they were going to create a portal for x instead of a social network for x. Structurally the idea is \\nstone soup: you post a sign saying \"this is the place for people interested in x,\" and all those people show up and you \\nmake money from them. What lures founders into this sort of idea are statistics about the millions of people who \\nmight be interested in each type of x. What they forget is that any given person might have 20 affinities by this \\nstandard, and no one is going to visit 20 different communities regularly.\\n[2] I\\'m not saying, incidentally, that I know for sure a social network for pet owners is a bad idea.

So \\nif all you know about a startup idea is that it sounds plausible, you have to assume it's bad.\\n[3] More precisely, the users' need has to give them sufficient activation energy to start using whatever you make, \\nwhich can vary a lot. For example, the activation energy for enterprise software sold through traditional channels is \\nvery high, so you'd have to be a lot better to get users to switch. Whereas the activation energy required to switch to \\na new search engine is low.

Few non-programmers grasped that in 1995, but \\nthe programmers had seen what GUIs had done for desktop computers.\\n[6] Maybe it would work to have this second self keep a journal, and each night to make a brief entry listing the gaps \\nand anomalies you'd noticed that day.

Millions of companies are started every year in the US. Only a \\ntiny fraction are startups. Most are service businesses — restaurants, barbershops, plumbers, \\nand so on. These are not startups, except in a few unusual cases. A barbershop isn't designed \\nto grow fast.

If \\nall companies were essentially similar, but some through luck or the efforts of their founders \\nended up growing very fast, we wouldn\\'t need a separate word. We could just talk about super-\\nsuccessful companies and less successful ones. But in fact startups do have a different sort of \\nDNA from other businesses. Google is not just a barbershop whose founders were unusually \\nlucky and hard-working. Google was different from the beginning.\\nTo grow rapidly, you need to make something you can sell to a big market. That\\'s the difference \\nbetween Google and a barbershop.

Barbershops are doing fine in the (a) department. Almost everyone \\nneeds their hair cut. The problem for a barbershop, as for any retail establishment, is (b). A \\nbarbershop serves customers in person, and few will travel far for a haircut. And even if they \\ndid, the barbershop couldn't accomodate them. [1]\\nWriting software is a great way to solve (b), but you can still end up constrained in (a). If you \\nwrite software to teach Tibetan to Hungarian speakers, you'll be able to reach most of the \\npeople who want it, but there won't be many of them.

If you open a bar in a \\nparticular neighborhood, as well as limiting your potential and protecting you from competitors, \\nthat geographic constraint also helps define your company. Bar + neighborhood is a sufficient \\nidea for a small business. Similarly for companies constrained in (a). Your niche both protects \\nand defines you.\\nWhereas if you want to start a startup, you're probably going to have to think of something fairly \\nnovel.

Usually successful startups happen because the founders are sufficiently different \\nfrom other people that ideas few others can see seem obvious to them. Perhaps later they step \\nback and notice they've found an idea in everyone else's blind spot, and from that point make a \\ndeliberate effort to stay there.

Because he not only wanted a computer but knew how to build them, \\nWozniak was able to make himself one. And the problem he solved for himself became one that \\nApple solved for millions of people in the coming years. But by the time it was obvious to \\nordinary people that this was a big market, Apple was already established.\\nGoogle has similar origins. Larry Page and Sergey Brin wanted to search the web.

But as happened with \\nApple, by the time everyone else realized how important search was, Google was entrenched.\\nThat's one connection between startup ideas and technology. Rapid change in one area \\nuncovers big, soluble problems in other areas. Sometimes the changes are advances, and what \\nthey change is solubility.

When a startup both begins with an idea exposed by technological change and \\nmakes a product consisting of technology in the narrower sense (what used to be called \"high \\ntechnology\"), it\\'s easy to conflate the two. But the two connections are distinct and in principle \\none could start a startup that was neither driven by technological change, nor whose product \\nconsisted of technology except in the broader sense.

Growth will slow, partly due to \\ninternal limits and partly because the company is starting to bump up against the limits of the \\nmarkets it serves.

If you don\\'t know that \\nnumber, you don\\'t even know if you\\'re doing well or badly.\\nWhen I first meet founders and ask what their growth rate is, sometimes they tell me \"we get \\nabout a hundred new customers a month.\" That\\'s not a rate. What matters is not the absolute \\nnumber of new customers, but the ratio of new customers to existing ones. If you\\'re really \\ngetting a constant number of new customers every month, you\\'re in trouble, because that \\nmeans your growth rate is decreasing.\\nDuring Y Combinator we measure growth rate per week, partly because there is so little time \\nbefore Demo Day, and partly because startups early on need frequent feedback from their \\nusers to tweak', 'ng.\\nDuring Y Combinator we measure growth rate per week, partly because there is so little time \\nbefore Demo Day, and partly because startups early on need frequent feedback from their \\nusers to tweak what they\\'re doing.

If you can only manage 1%, it\\'s a sign you haven\\'t yet figured out what you\\'re \\ndoing.\\nThe best thing to measure the growth rate of is revenue. The next best, for startups that aren\\'t \\ncharging initially, is active users. That\\'s a reasonable proxy for revenue growth because \\nwhenever the startup does start trying to make money, their revenues will probably be a \\nconstant multiple of active users. [7]\\nCompass\\nWe usually advise startups to pick a growth rate they think they can hit, and then just try to hit it \\nevery week. The key word here is \"just.\" If they decide to grow at 7% a week and they hit that \\nnumber, they\\'re successful for that week.

We\\'re turning starting a startup into an \\noptimization problem. And anyone who has tried optimizing code knows how wonderfully \\neffective that sort of narrow focus can be. Optimizing code means taking an existing program \\nand changing it to use less of something, usually time or memory. You don\\'t have to think about \\nwhat the program should do, just make it faster. For most programmers this is very satisfying \\nwork. The narrow focus makes it a sort of puzzle, and you\\'re generally surprised how fast you \\ncan solve it.\\nFocusing on hitting a growth rate reduces the otherwise bewilderingly multifarious problem o', \"ork.

You can use that target growth rate to make all your \\ndecisions for you; anything that gets you the growth you need is ipso facto right. Should you \\nspend two days at a conference? Should you hire another programmer? Should you focus more \\non marketing? Should you spend time courting some big customer? Should you add x feature? \\nWhatever gets you your target growth rate. [8]\\nJudging yourself by weekly growth doesn't mean you can look no more than a week ahead. \\nOnce you experience the pain of missing your target one week (it was the only thing that \\nmattered, and you failed at it), you become interested in anything that could spare you such \\npain in the future.

But only if (a) the distraction of hiring someone won't make \\nyou miss your numbers in the short term, and (b) you're sufficiently worried about whether you \\ncan keep hitting your numbers without hiring someone new.\\nIt's not that you don't think about the future, just that you think about it no more than necessary.\\nIn theory this sort of hill-climbing could get a startup into trouble. They could end up on a local \\nmaximum. But in practice that never happens. Having to hit a growth number every week forces \\nfounders to act, and acting versus not acting is the high bit of succeeding.

Plus the maxima in the space of startup \\nideas are not spiky and isolated. Most fairly good ideas are adjacent to even better ones.\\nThe fascinating thing about optimizing for growth is that it can actually discover startup ideas. \\nYou can use the need for growth as a form of evolutionary pressure. If you start out with some \\ninitial plan and modify it as necessary to keep hitting, say, 10% weekly growth, you may end up \\nwith a quite different company than you meant to start. But anything that grows consistently at \\n10% a week is almost certainly a better idea than you started with.\\nThere's a parallel here to small businesses.

When Richard Feynman said that the \\nimagination of nature was greater than the imagination of man, he meant that if you just keep \\nfollowing the truth you'll discover cooler things than you could ever have made up.

But just two companies, \\nDropbox and Airbnb, account for about three quarters of it.\\nIn startups, the big winners are big to a degree that violates our expectations about variation. I \\ndon't know whether these expectations are innate or learned, but whatever the cause, we are \\njust not prepared for the 1000x variation in outcomes that one finds in startup investing.\\nThat yields all sorts of strange consequences. For example, in purely financial terms, there is \\nprobably at most one company in each YC batch that will have a significant effect on our \\nreturns, and the rest are just a cost of doing business.

[2] You need to do what you know intellectually to \\nbe right, even though it feels wrong.\\nIt\\'s a constant battle for us. It\\'s hard to make ourselves take enough risks. When you interview a \\nstartup and think \"they seem likely to succeed,\" it\\'s hard not to fund them. And yet, financially at \\nleast, there is only one kind of success: they\\'re either going to be one of the really big winners \\nor not, and if not it doesn\\'t matter whether you fund them, because even if they succeed the \\neffect on your returns will be insignificant. In the same day of interviews you might meet some \\nsmart 19 year olds who aren\\'t ', \" doesn't matter whether you fund them, because even if they succeed the \\neffect on your returns will be insignificant. In the same day of interviews you might meet some \\nsmart 19 year olds who aren't even sure what they want to work on. Their chances of \\nsucceeding seem small. But again, it's not their chances of succeeding that matter but their \\nchances of succeeding really big. The probability that any group will succeed really big is \\nmicroscopically small, but the probability that those 19 year olds will might be higher than that \\nof the other, safer group.\\nThe probability that a startup will make it big is not simply a constant fraction of the probability \\nthat they will succeed at all. If it were, you could fund everyone who seemed likely to succeed at \\nall, and you'd get that fraction of big hits. Unfortunately picking winners is harder than that. You \\nhave to ignore the elephant in front of you, the likelihood they'll succeed, and focus instead on \\nthe separate and almost invis\", 'on of big hits. Unfortunately picking winners is harder than that. You \\nhave to ignore the elephant in front of you, the likelihood they\\'ll succeed, and focus instead on \\nthe separate and almost invisibly intangible question of whether they\\'ll succeed really big.\\nHarder\\nThat\\'s made harder by the fact that the best startup ideas seem at first like bad ideas. I\\'ve \\nwritten about this before: if a good idea were obviously good, someone else would already have \\ndone it. So the most successful founders tend to work on ideas that few beside them realize are \\ngood. Which is not that far from a description of insanity, till you reach the point where you see \\nresults.\\nThe first time Peter Thiel spoke at YC he drew a Venn diagram that illustrates the situation \\nperfectly. He drew two intersecting circles, one labelled \"seems like a bad idea\" and the other \\n\"is a good idea.\" The intersection is the sweet spot for startups.\\nThis concept is a simple one and yet seeing it as a Venn diagram is illumi', 'rcles, one labelled \"seems like a bad idea\" and the other \\n\"is a good idea.\" The intersection is the sweet spot for startups.\\nThis concept is a simple one and yet seeing it as a Venn diagram is illuminating. It reminds you \\nthat there is an intersection—that there are good ideas that seem bad. It also reminds you that \\nthe vast majority of ideas that seem bad are bad.\\nThe fact that the best ideas seem like bad ideas makes it even harder to recognize the big \\nwinners. It means the probability of a startup making it really big is not merely not a constant \\nfraction of the probability that it will succeed, but that the startups with a high probability of the \\nformer will seem to have a disproportionately low probability of the latter.\\nHistory tends to get rewritten by big successes, so that in retrospect it seems obvious they were \\ngoing to make it big.

[3]\\nHarder Still\\nWait, it gets worse. You not only have to solve this hard problem, but you have to do it with no \\nindication of whether you're succeeding. When you pick a big winner, you won't know it for two \\nyears.\\nMeanwhile, the one thing you can measure is dangerously misleading. The one thing we can \\ntrack precisely is how well the startups in each batch do at fundraising after Demo Day. But we \\nknow that's the wrong metric.

We're in a business where we need to pick unpromising-looking outliers, \\nand the huge scale of the successes means we can afford to spread our net very widely. The \\nbig winners could generate 10,000x returns. That means for each big winner we could pick a \\nthousand companies that returned nothing and still end up 10x ahead.\\nIf we ever got to the point where 100% of the startups we funded were able to raise money after \\nDemo Day, it would almost certainly mean we were being too conservative.

A Demo \\nDay where only 30% of the startups were fundable would be a shambles. Everyone would \\nagree that YC had jumped the shark.

We didn\\'t \"swing for the \\nfences\" in our own startup (Viaweb, which was acquired for $50 million), and it would feel pretty bogus to press \\nfounders to do something we didn\\'t do.

For example, when I give a talk, I usually write it out \\nbeforehand. I know that\\'s a mistake; I know delivering a prewritten talk makes it harder to \\nengage with an audience. The way to get the attention of an audience is to give them your full \\nattention, and when you\\'re delivering a prewritten talk, your attention is always divided between \\nthe audience and the talk — even if you\\'ve memorized it. If you want to engage an audience, it\\'s \\nbetter to start with no more than an outline of what you want to say and ad lib the individual \\nsentences. But if you do that, you might spend no more time thinking about each sentence than \\nit takes to say it.

[2] Occasionally the stimulation of talking to a live audience makes you think of \\nnew things, but in general this is not going to generate ideas as well as writing does, where you \\ncan spend as long on each sentence as you want.\\nIf you rehearse a prewritten speech enough, you can get asymptotically close to the sort of \\nengagement you get when speaking ad lib. Actors do. But here again there's a tradeoff between \\nsmoothness and ideas. All the time you spend practicing a talk, you could instead spend \\nmaking it better. Actors don't face that temptation, except in the rare cases where they've \\nwritten the script, but any speaker does.

Which of course makes me um \\neven more, because I haven't had any time to practice the new bits. [3]\\nDepending on your audience, there are even worse tradeoffs than these. Audiences like to be \\nflattered; they like jokes; they like to be swept off their feet by a vigorous stream of words. As \\nyou decrease the intelligence of the audience, being a good speaker is increasingly a matter of \\nbeing a good bullshitter. That's true in writing too of course, but the descent is steeper with \\ntalks. Any given person is dumber as a member of an audience than as a reader.

Every audience is an \\nincipient mob, and a good speaker uses that. Part of the reason I laughed so much at the talk \\nby the good speaker at that conference was that everyone else did.

So YC started with $200k. Jessica was so \\nhappy to be able to quit her job and start her own company that I took her picture when we got \\nhome. The company wasn't called Y Combinator yet.

By the \\ntime they left the building they were all saying some variant of \"Wow, these companies might \\nactually succeed.\" Now YC is well enough known that people are no longer surprised when the \\ncompanies we fund are legit, but it took a while for reputation to catch up with reality. That\\'s one \\nof the reasons we especially like funding ideas that might be dismissed as \"toys\" ÿý because YC \\nitself was dismissed as one initially. When we saw how well it worked to fund companies \\nsynchronously, we decided we\\'d keep doing that. We\\'d fund two batches of startups a year. We \\nfunded the second batch in Silicon Valley. That was a last minute decision. In retrospect I think \\nwhat pushed me over the edge was going to Foo Camp that fall. The density of startup people \\nin the Bay Area was so much greater than in Boston, and the weather was so nice. I \\nremembered that from living there in the 90s.

We didn't have time to get our own \\nbuilding anywhere. The only way to get enough space in time was to convince Trevor to let us \\ntake over part of his (as it then seemed) giant building in Mountain View.

One of the cases he decided was brought by the owner of a food shop. A poor \\nstudent who could afford only rice was eating his rice while enjoying the delicious cooking \\nsmells coming from the food shop. The owner wanted the student to pay for the smells he was \\nenjoying.\\nThe student was stealing his smells!\\nThis story often comes to mind when I hear the RIAA and MPAA accusing people of stealing \\nmusic and movies.\\nIt sounds ridiculous to us to treat smells as property.

Get funded by Y Combinator. \\n March 2012\\nOne of the more surprising things I've noticed while working on Y Combinator is how frightening \\nthe most ambitious startup ideas are. In this essay I'm going to demonstrate this phenomenon \\nby describing some. Any one of them could make you a billionaire. That might sound like an \\nattractive prospect, and yet when I describe these ideas you may notice you find yourself \\nshrinking away from them.\\nDon't worry, it's not a sign of weakness.

And not just because they'd be a lot of work. The biggest ideas seem to threaten \\nyour identity: you wonder if you'd have enough ambition to carry them through.\\nThere's a scene in Being John Malkovich where the nerdy hero encounters a very attractive, \\nsophisticated woman. She says to him: Here's the thing: If you ever got me, you wouldn't have a \\nclue what to do with me. That's what these ideas say to us.\\nThis phenomenon is one of the most important things you can understand about startups. [1] \\nYou'd expect big startup ideas to be attractive, but actually they tend to repel you. And that has \\na bunch of consequences. It means these ideas are invisible to most people who try to think of \\nstartup ideas, because their subconscious filters them out. Even the most ambitious people are \\nprobably best off approaching them obliquely.\\n1. A New Search Engine\\nThe best i\", \"ple who try to think of \\nstartup ideas, because their subconscious filters them out. Even the most ambitious people are \\nprobably best off approaching them obliquely.\\n1. A New Search Engine\\nThe best ideas are just on the right side of impossible. I don't know if this one is possible, but \\nthere are signs it might be. Making a new search engine means competing with Google, and \\nrecently I've noticed some cracks in their fortress.\\nThe point when it became clear to me that Microsoft had lost their way was when they decided \\nto get into the search business. That was not a natural move for Microsoft. They did it because \\nthey were afraid of Google, and Google was in the search business. But this meant (a) Google \\nwas now setting Microsoft's agenda, and (b) Microsoft's agenda consisted of stuff they weren't \\ngood at.\\nMicrosoft : Google :: Google : Facebook.\\nThat does not by itself mean there's room for a new search engine, but lately when using \\nGoogle search I've found myself nostalgic for \", \"they weren't \\ngood at.\\nMicrosoft : Google :: Google : Facebook.\\nThat does not by itself mean there's room for a new search engine, but lately when using \\nGoogle search I've found myself nostalgic for the old days, when Google was true to its own \\nslightly aspy self. Google used to give me a page of the right answers, fast, with no clutter. Now \\nthe results seem inspired by the Scientologist principle that what's true is what's true for you. \\nAnd the pages don't have the clean, sparse feel they used to. Google search results used to \\nlook like the output of a Unix utility. Now if I accidentally put the cursor in the wrong place, \\nanything might happen.\\nThe way to win here is to build the search engine all the hackers use. A search engine whose \\nusers consisted of the top 10,000 hackers and no one else would be in a very powerful position \\ndespite its small size, just as Google was when it was that search engine.

And for the first time \\nin over a decade the idea of switching seems thinkable to me.\\nSince anyone capable of starting this company is one of those 10,000 hackers, the route is at \\nleast straightforward: make the search engine you yourself want. Feel free to make it \\nexcessively hackerish. Make it really good for code search, for example. Would you like search \\nqueries to be Turing complete? Anything that gets you those 10,000 users is ipso facto good.\\nDon't worry if something you want to do will constrain you in the long term, because if you don't \\nget that initial core of users, there won't be a long term. If you can just build something that you \\nand your friends genuinely prefer to Google, you're already about 10% of the way to an IPO, \\njust as Facebook was (though they probably didn't realize it) when they got all the Harvard \\nundergrads.\\n2.

Replace Email\\nEmail was not designed to be used the way we use it now. Email is not a messaging protocol. \\nIt's a todo list. Or rather, my inbox is a todo list, and email is the way things get onto it. But it is a \\ndisastrously bad todo list.\\nI'm open to different types of solutions to this problem, but I suspect that tweaking the inbox is \\nnot enough, and that email has to be replaced with a new protocol. This new protocol should be \\na todo list protocol, not a messaging protocol, although there is a degenerate case where what \\nsomeone wants you to do is: read the following text.\\nAs a todo list protocol, the new protocol should give more power to the recipient than email \\ndoes. I want there to be more restrictions on what someone can put on my todo list.

Do they want me to do something beyond just reading some text? How important is it? \\n(There obviously has to be some mechanism to prevent people from saying everything is \\nimportant.) When does it have to be done?\\nThis is one of those ideas that's like an irresistible force meeting an immovable object. On one \\nhand, entrenched protocols are impossible to replace. On the other, it seems unlikely that \\npeople in 100 years will still be living in the same email hell we do now. And if email is going to \\nget replaced eventually, why not now?\\nIf you do it right, you may be able to avoid the usual chicken and egg problem new protocols \\nface, because some of the most powerful people in the world will be among the first to switch to \\nit.\", \"now?\\nIf you do it right, you may be able to avoid the usual chicken and egg problem new protocols \\nface, because some of the most powerful people in the world will be among the first to switch to \\nit.

[2] If you made something \\nno better than GMail, but fast, that alone would let you start to pull users away from GMail.\\nGMail is slow because Google can't afford to spend a lot on it. But people will pay for this. I'd \\nhave no problem paying $50 a month. Considering how much time I spend in email, it's kind of \\nscary to think how much I'd be justified in paying. At least $1000 a month. If I spend several \\nhours a day reading and writing email, that would be a cheap way to make my life better.\\n3.

Replace Universities\\nPeople are all over this idea lately, and I think they're onto something. I'm reluctant to suggest \\nthat an institution that's been around for a millennium is finished just because of some mistakes \\nthey made in the last few decades, but certainly in the last few decades US universities seem to \\nhave been headed down the wrong path. One could do a lot better for a lot less money.\\nI don't think universities will disappear. They won't be replaced wholesale. They'll just lose the \\nde facto monopoly on certain types of learning that they once had. There will be many different \\nways to learn different things, and some may look quite different from universities. Y \\nCombinator itself is arguably one of them.\\nLearning is such a big problem that changing the way people do it will have a wave of \\nsecondary effects.

There may even need to be replacements for \\ncampus social life (and oddly enough, YC even has aspects of that).\\nYou could replace high schools too, but there you face bureaucratic obstacles that would slow \\ndown a startup. Universities seem the place to start.\\n4. Internet Drama\\nHollywood has been slow to embrace the Internet. That was a mistake, because I think we can \\nnow call a winner in the race between delivery mechanisms, and it is the Internet, not cable.\\nA lot of the reason is the horribleness of cable clients, also known as TVs. Our family didn't wait \\nfor Apple TV. We hated our last TV so much that a few months ago we replaced it with an iMac \\nbolted to the wall. It's a little inconvenient to control it with a wir\", 'wn as TVs. Our family didn\\'t wait \\nfor Apple TV. We hated our last TV so much that a few months ago we replaced it with an iMac \\nbolted to the wall. It\\'s a little inconvenient to control it with a wireless mouse, but the overall \\nexperience is much better than the nightmare UI we had to deal with before.\\nSome of the attention people currently devote to watching movies and TV can be stolen by \\nthings that seem completely unrelated, like social networking apps. More can be stolen by \\nthings that are a little more closely related, like games. But there will probably always remain \\nsome residual demand for conventional drama, where you sit passively and watch as a plot \\nhappens. So how do you deliver drama via the Internet? Whatever you make will have to be on \\na larger scale than Youtube clips. When people sit down to watch a show, they want to know \\nwhat they\\'re going to get: either part of a series with familiar characters, or a single longer \\n\"movie\" whose basic premise they know in ad', 's. When people sit down to watch a show, they want to know \\nwhat they\\'re going to get: either part of a series with familiar characters, or a single longer \\n\"movie\" whose basic premise they know in advance.\\nThere are two ways delivery and payment could play out. Either some company like Netflix or \\nApple will be the app store for entertainment, and you\\'ll reach audiences through them. Or the \\nwould-be app stores will be too overreaching, or too technically inflexible, and companies will \\narise to supply payment and streaming a la carte to the producers of drama. If that\\'s the way \\nthings play out, there will also be a need for such infrastructure companies.\\n5. The Next Steve Jobs\\nI was talking recently to someone who knew Apple well, and I asked him if the people now \\nrunning the company would be able to keep creating new things the way Apple had under Steve \\nJobs. His answer was simply \"no.\" I already feared that would be the answer. I asked more to \\nsee how he\\'d qualify it. But he di', 'ould be able to keep creating new things the way Apple had under Steve \\nJobs. His answer was simply \"no.\" I already feared that would be the answer. I asked more to \\nsee how he\\'d qualify it. But he didn\\'t qualify it at all. No, there will be no more great new stuff \\nbeyond whatever\\'s currently in the pipeline. Apple\\'s revenues may continue to rise for a long \\ntime, but as Microsoft shows, revenue is a lagging indicator in the technology business.\\nSo if Apple\\'s not going to make the next iPad, who is? None of the existing players. None of \\nthem are run by product visionaries, and empirically you can\\'t seem to get those by hiring them. \\nEmpirically the way you get a product visionary as CEO is for him to found the company and \\nnot get fired. So the company that creates the next wave of hardware is probably going to have \\nto be a startup.\\nI realize it sounds preposterously ambitious for a startup to try to become as big as Apple. But \\nno more ambitious than it was for Apple to become as b', 'are is probably going to have \\nto be a startup.\\nI realize it sounds preposterously ambitious for a startup to try to become as big as Apple. But \\nno more ambitious than it was for Apple to become as big as Apple, and they did it. Plus a \\nstartup taking on this problem now has an advantage the original Apple didn\\'t: the example of \\nApple. Steve Jobs has shown us what\\'s possible. That helps would-be successors both directly, \\nas Roger Bannister did, by showing how much better you can do than people did before, and \\nindirectly, as Augustus did, by lodging the idea in users\\' minds that a single person could unroll \\nthe future for them. [3]\\nNow Steve is gone there\\'s a vacuum we can all feel. If a new company led boldly into the future \\nof hardware, users would follow. The CEO of that company, the \"next Steve Jobs,\" might not \\nmeasure up to Steve Jobs. But he wouldn\\'t have to. He\\'d just have to do a better job than \\nSamsung and HP and Nokia, and that seems pretty doable.\\n6. Bring Back Moore\\'', 'he \"next Steve Jobs,\" might not \\nmeasure up to Steve Jobs. But he wouldn\\'t have to. He\\'d just have to do a better job than \\nSamsung and HP and Nokia, and that seems pretty doable.\\n6. Bring Back Moore\\'s Law\\nThe last 10 years have reminded us what Moore\\'s Law actually says. Till about 2002 you could \\nsafely misinterpret it as promising that clock speeds would double every 18 months. Actually \\nwhat it says is that circuit densities will double every 18 months. It used to seem pedantic to \\npoint that out. Not any more. Intel can no longer give us faster CPUs, just more of them.\\nThis Moore\\'s Law is not as good as the old one. Moore\\'s Law used to mean that if your software \\nwas slow, all you had to do was wait, and the inexorable progress of hardware would solve your \\nproblems. Now if your software is slow you have to rewrite it to do more things in parallel, which \\nis a lot more work than waiting.\\nIt would be great if a startup could give us something of the old Moore\\'s Law back, by writing', \"are is slow you have to rewrite it to do more things in parallel, which \\nis a lot more work than waiting.\\nIt would be great if a startup could give us something of the old Moore's Law back, by writing \\nsoftware that could make a large number of CPUs look to the developer like one very fast CPU. \\nThere are several ways to approach this problem. The most ambitious is to try to do it \\nautomatically: to write a compiler that will parallelize our code for us. There's a name for this \\ncompiler, the sufficiently smart compiler, and it is a byword for impossibility. But is it really \\nimpossible? Is there no configuration of the bits in memory of a present day computer that is \\nthis compiler? If you really think so, you should try to prove it, because that would be an \\ninteresting result. And if it's not impossible but simply very hard, it might be worth trying to write \\nit. The expected value would be high even if the chance of succeeding was low.\\nThe reason the expected value is so high is we\", \"'s not impossible but simply very hard, it might be worth trying to write \\nit. The expected value would be high even if the chance of succeeding was low.\\nThe reason the expected value is so high is web services. If you could write software that gave \\nprogrammers the convenience of the way things were in the old days, you could offer it to them \\nas a web service. And that would in turn mean that you got practically all the users.\\nImagine there was another processor manufacturer that could still translate increased circuit \\ndensities into increased clock speeds. They'd take most of Intel's business. And since web \\nservices mean that no one sees their processors anymore, by writing the sufficiently smart \\ncompiler you could create a situation indistinguishable from you being that manufacturer, at \\nleast for the server market.\\nThe least ambitious way of approaching the problem is to start from the other end, and offer \\nprogrammers more parallelizable Lego blocks to build programs out of, l\", \", at \\nleast for the server market.\\nThe least ambitious way of approaching the problem is to start from the other end, and offer \\nprogrammers more parallelizable Lego blocks to build programs out of, like Hadoop and \\nMapReduce. Then the programmer still does much of the work of optimization.\\nThere's an intriguing middle ground where you build a semi-automatic weapon—where there's \\na human in the loop. You make something that looks to the user like the sufficiently smart \\ncompiler, but inside has people, using highly developed optimization tools to find and eliminate \\nbottlenecks in users' programs. These people might be your employees, or you might create a \\nmarketplace for optimization.\\nAn optimization marketplace would be a way to generate the sufficiently smart compiler \\npiecemeal, because participants would immediately start writing bots. It would be a curious \\nstate of affairs if you could get to the point where everything could be done by bots, because \\nthen you'd have made the su\", \"se participants would immediately start writing bots. It would be a curious \\nstate of affairs if you could get to the point where everything could be done by bots, because \\nthen you'd have made the sufficiently smart compiler, but no one person would have a complete \\ncopy of it.\\nI realize how crazy all this sounds. In fact, what I like about this idea is all the different ways in \\nwhich it's wrong. The whole idea of focusing on optimization is counter to the general trend in \\nsoftware development for the last several decades. Trying to write the sufficiently smart \\ncompiler is by definition a mistake. And even if it weren't, compilers are the sort of software \\nthat's supposed to be created by open source projects, not companies. Plus if this works it will \\ndeprive all the programmers who take pleasure in making multithreaded apps of so much \\namusing complexity.

Ongoing Diagnosis\\nBut wait, here's another that could face even greater resistance: ongoing, automatic medical \\ndiagnosis.\\nOne of my tricks for generating startup ideas is to imagine the ways in which we'll seem \\nbackward to future generations. And I'm pretty sure that to people 50 or 100 years in the future, \\nit will seem barbaric that people in our era waited till they had symptoms to be diagnosed with \\nconditions like heart disease and cancer.\\nFor example, in 2004 Bill Clinton found he was feeling short of breath. Doctors discovered that \\nseveral of his arteries were over 90% blocked and 3 days later he had a quadruple bypass. It \\nseems reasonable to assume Bill Clinton has the best medical care available. And yet even he \\nhad to wait till his arteries we\", \"ies were over 90% blocked and 3 days later he had a quadruple bypass. It \\nseems reasonable to assume Bill Clinton has the best medical care available. And yet even he \\nhad to wait till his arteries were over 90% blocked to learn that the number was over 90%. \\nSurely at some point in the future we'll know these numbers the way we now know something \\nlike our weight. Ditto for cancer. It will seem preposterous to future generations that we wait till \\npatients have physical symptoms to be diagnosed with cancer. Cancer will show up on some \\nsort of radar screen immediately.\\n(Of course, what shows up on the radar screen may be different from what we think of now as \\ncancer. I wouldn't be surprised if at any given time we have ten or even hundreds of \\nmicrocancers going at once, none of which normally amount to anything.)\\nA lot of the obstacles to ongoing diagnosis will come from the fact that it's going against the \\ngrain of the medical profession.

The way medicine has always worked is that patients come to \\ndoctors with problems, and the doctors figure out what\\'s wrong.

They call the things that get \\ndiscovered this way \"incidentalomas,\" and they are something of a nuisance.\\nFor example, a friend of mine once had her brain scanned as part of a study. She was horrified \\nwhen the doctors running the study discovered what appeared to be a large tumor. After further \\ntesting, it turned out to be a harmless cyst. But it cost her a few days of terror.

A lot of doctors \\nworry that if you start scanning people with no symptoms, you'll get this on a giant scale: a \\nhuge number of false alarms that make patients panic and require expensive and perhaps even \\ndangerous tests to resolve. But I think that's just an artifact of current limitations. If people were \\nscanned all the time and we got better at deciding what was a real problem, my friend would \\nhave known about this cyst her whole life and known it was harmless, just as we do a birthmark.\\nThere is room for a lot of startups here. In addition to the technical obstacles all startups face, \\nand the bureaucratic obstacles all medical startups face, they'll be going against thousands of \\nyears of medical tradition.

If you want to take on a problem as big as the ones \\nI\\'ve discussed, don\\'t make a direct frontal attack on it. Don\\'t say, for example, that you\\'re going \\nto replace email. If you do that you raise too many expectations. Your employees and investors \\nwill constantly be asking \"are we there yet?\" and you\\'ll have an army of haters waiting to see \\nyou fail. Just say you\\'re building todo-list software. That sounds harmless. People can notice \\nyou\\'ve replaced email when it\\'s a fait accompli. [4]\\nEmpirically, the way to do really big things seems to be to start with deceptively small things. \\nWant to dominate microcomputer software?

You need to for your own \\nsake. Neither Bill Gates nor Mark Zuckerberg knew at first how big their companies were going \\nto get. All they knew was that they were onto something. Maybe it's a bad idea to have really big \\nambitions initially, because the bigger your ambition, the longer it's going to take, and the \\nfurther you project into the future, the more likely you'll get it wrong.\\nI think the way to use these big ideas is not to try to identify a precise point in the future and \\nthen ask yourself how to get from here to there, like the popular image of a visionary.

Most expect founders to walk in \\nwith a clear plan for the future, and judge them based on that.

We found the startups that did best were \\nthe ones with the sort of founders about whom we\\'d say \"they can take care of themselves.\" \\nThe startups that do best are fire-and-forget in the sense that all you have to do is give them a \\nlead, and they\\'ll close it, whatever type of lead it is.

You\\'d expect that if the founders at one end were distinguished \\nby the presence of quality x, at the other end they\\'d be distinguished by lack of x. Was there \\nsome kind of inverse relation between resourcefulness and being hard to talk to?\\nIt turns out there is, and the key to the mystery is the old adage \"a word to the wise is \\nsufficient.\" Because this phrase is not only overused, but overused in an indirect way (by \\nprepending the subject to some advice), most people who\\'ve heard it don\\'t know what it means. \\nWhat it means is', 'ficient.\" Because this phrase is not only overused, but overused in an indirect way (by \\nprepending the subject to some advice), most people who\\'ve heard it don\\'t know what it means. \\nWhat it means is that if someone is wise, all you have to do is say one word to them, and they\\'ll \\nunderstand immediately.

That\\'s the connection. Understanding all the \\nimplications — even the inconvenient implications — of what someone tells you is a subset of \\nresourcefulness. It\\'s conversational resourcefulness.\\nLike real world resourcefulness, conversational resourcefulness often means doing things you \\ndon\\'t want to.

Schlep was originally a Yiddish word \\nbut has passed into general use in the US. It means a tedious, unpleasant task.\\nNo one likes schleps, but hackers especially dislike them.

Maybe that's possible, but I haven't seen it.\\nOne of the many things we do at Y Combinator is teach hackers about the inevitability of \\nschleps. No, you can't start a startup by just writing code. I remember going through this \\nrealization myself.

Which is not to say you should seek out unpleasant work per se, \\nbut that you should never shrink from it if it's on the path to something great.\\nThe most dangerous thing about our dislike of schleps is that much of it is unconscious. Your \\nunconscious won't even let you see ideas that involve painful schleps. That's schlep blindness.\\nThe phenomenon isn't limited to startups.

For over \\na decade, every hacker who\\'d ever had to process payments online knew how painful the \\nexperience was. Thousands of people must have known about this problem. And yet when they \\nstarted startups, they decided to build recipe sites, or aggregators for local events. Why? Why \\nwork on problems few care much about and no one will pay for, when you could fix one of the \\nmost important components of the world\\'s infrastructure? Because schlep blindness prevented \\npeople from even considering the idea of fixing payments.\\nProbably no one who applied to Y Combinator to work on a recipe site began by asking \"should \\nwe fix payments, or build a recipe site?\" and chose the recipe site.

It\\'s a lot \\nmore intimidating to start a startup like this than a recipe site.\\nThat scariness makes ambitious ideas doubly valuable.

Maybe that's one reason the most successful startups of all so \\noften have young founders.\\nIn practice the founders grow with the problems.

The real question is, \\nwhat's saving startups in places like Silicon Valley? [2]\\nEnvironment\\nI think there are two components to the antidote: being in a place where startups are the cool \\nthing to do, and chance meetings with people who can help you. And what drives them both is \\nthe number of startup people around you.\\nThe first component is particularly helpful in the first stage of a startup's life, when you go from \\nmerely having an interest in starting a company to actually doing it. It's quite a leap to start a \\nstartup. It's an unusual thing to do. But in Sil\", \" first stage of a startup's life, when you go from \\nmerely having an interest in starting a company to actually doing it. It's quite a leap to start a \\nstartup.

People in the \\nValley aren't automatically impressed with you just because you're starting a company, but they \\npay attention. Anyone who's been here any amount of time knows not to default to skepticism, \\nno matter how inexperienced you seem or how unpromising your idea sounds at first, because \\nthey've all seen inexperienced founders with unpromising sounding ideas who a few years later \\nwere billionaires.\\nHaving people around you care about what you're doing is an extraordinarily powerful force. \\nEven the most willful people are susceptible to it. About a year after we started Y Combinator I \\nsaid something to a partner at a well known VC firm that gave him the (mistaken) i\", \"ly powerful force. \\nEven the most willful people are susceptible to it.

He responded so eagerly that for about half a second \\nI found myself considering doing it.\\nIn most other cities, the prospect of starting a startup just doesn't seem real. In the Valley it's \\nnot only real but fashionable. That no doubt causes a lot of people to start startups who \\nshouldn't. But I think that's ok. Few people are suited to running a startup, and it's very hard to \\npredict beforehand which are (as I know all too well from being in the business of trying to \\npredict beforehand), so lots of people starting startups who shouldn't is probably the optimal \\nstate of affairs.

This \\nforce works in both phases: both in the transition from the desire to start a startup to starting \\none, and the transition from starting a company to succeeding. The power of chance meetings \\nis more variable than people around you caring about startups, which is like a sort of \\nbackground radiation that affects everyone equally, but at its strongest it is far stronger.\\nChance meetings produce miracles to compensate for the disasters that characteristically befall \\nstartups.

It's not the physical infrastructure of Silicon Valley that makes it work, or \\nthe weather, or anything like that. Those helped get it started, but now that the reaction is self-\\nsustaining what drives it is the people.\\nMany observers have noticed that one of the most distinctive things about startup hubs is the \\ndegree to which people help one another out, with no expectation of getting anything in return. \\nI'm not sure why this is so.

We thought when we \\nstarted Y Combinator that the most important quality would be intelligence. That's the myth in \\nthe Valley. And certainly you don't want founders to be stupid. But as long as you're over a \\ncertain threshold of intelligence, what matters most is determination. You're going to hit a lot of \\nobstacles. You can't be the sort of person who gets demoralized easily.\\nBill Clerico and Rich Aberman of WePay are a good example.

Flexibility\\nYou do not however want the sort of determination implied by phrases like \"don\\'t give up on \\nyour dreams.\" The world of startups is so unpredictable that you need to be able to modify your \\ndreams on the fly. The best metaphor I\\'ve found for the combination of determination and \\nflexibility you need is a running back.

He'd \\nonly been working on it for a couple days when he presented to investors at Demo Day, but he \\ngot a lot of interest. He always seems to land on his feet.\\n3. Imagination\\nIntelligence does matter a lot of course. It seems like the type that matters most is imagination. \\nIt's not so important to be able to solve predefined problems quickly as to be able to come up \\nwith surprising new ideas.

Get funded by Y Combinator. \\n October 2010\\nAfter barely changing at all for decades, the startup funding business is now in what could, at \\nleast by comparison, be called turmoil. At Y Combinator we've seen dramatic changes in the \\nfunding environment for startups. Fortunately one of them is much higher valuations.\\nThe trends we've been seeing are probably not YC-specific.

Fortunately one of them is much higher valuations.\\nThe trends we've been seeing are probably not YC-specific. I wish I could say they were, but \\nthe main cause is probably just that we see trends first—partly because the startups we fund \\nare very plugged into the Valley and are quick to take advantage of anything new, and partly \\nbecause we fund so many that we have enough data points to see patterns clearly.\\nWhat we're seeing now, everyone's probably going to be seeing in the next couple years. So I'm \\ngoing to explain what we're seeing, and what that will mean for you if you try to raise money.\\nSuper-Angels\\nLet me start by describing what the world of startup funding used to look like. There used to be \\ntwo sharply differentiated types of investors: angels and venture capitalists. Angels are \\nindividual rich people who invest small amounts of their own money, while VCs are employees \\nof funds that invest lar\", \"ply differentiated types of investors: angels and venture capitalists. Angels are \\nindividual rich people who invest small amounts of their own money, while VCs are employees \\nof funds that invest large amounts of other people's.\\nFor decades there were just those two types of investors, but now a third type has appeared \\nhalfway between them: the so-called super-angels. [1] And VCs have been provoked by their \\narrival into making a lot of angel-style investments themselves. So the previously sharp line \\nbetween angels and VCs has become hopelessly blurred.\\nThere used to be a no man's land between angels and VCs. Angels would invest $20k to $50k \\napiece, and VCs usually a million or more. So an angel round meant a collection of angel \\ninvestments that combined to maybe $200k, and a VC round meant a series A round in which a \\nsingle VC fund (or occasionally two) invested $1-5 million.\\nThe no man's land between angels and VCs was a very inconvenient one for startups, because \\nit coincided\", \" meant a series A round in which a \\nsingle VC fund (or occasionally two) invested $1-5 million.\\nThe no man's land between angels and VCs was a very inconvenient one for startups, because \\nit coincided with the amount many wanted to raise. Most startups coming out of Demo Day \\nwanted to raise around $400k. But it was a pain to stitch together that much out of angel \\ninvestments, and most VCs weren't interested in investments so small. That's the fundamental \\nreason the super-angels have appeared. They're responding to the market.\\nThe arrival of a new type of investor is big news for startups, because there used to be only two \\nand they rarely competed with one another. Super-angels compete with both angels and VCs. \\nThat's going to change the rules about how to raise money. I don't know yet what the new rules \\nwill be, but it looks like most of the changes will be for the better.\\nA super-angel has some of the qualities of an angel, and some of the qualities of a VC. They're \\nusually ind\", \" what the new rules \\nwill be, but it looks like most of the changes will be for the better.\\nA super-angel has some of the qualities of an angel, and some of the qualities of a VC. They're \\nusually individuals, like angels. In fact many of the current super-angels were initially angels of \\nthe classic type. But like VCs, they invest other people's money. This allows them to invest \\nlarger amounts than angels: a typical super-angel investment is currently about $100k. They \\nmake investment decisions quickly, like angels. And they make a lot more investments per \\npartner than VCs—up to 10 times as many.\\nThe fact that super-angels invest other people's money makes them doubly alarming to VCs. \\nThey don't just compete for startups; they also compete for investors. What super-angels really \\nare is a new form of fast-moving, lightweight VC fund. And those of us in the technology world \\nknow what usually happens when something comes along that can be described in terms like \\nthat. Usually it's\", \"is a new form of fast-moving, lightweight VC fund. And those of us in the technology world \\nknow what usually happens when something comes along that can be described in terms like \\nthat. Usually it's the replacement.\\nWill it be? As of now, few of the startups that take money from super-angels are ruling out \\ntaking VC money. They're just postponing it. But that's still a problem for VCs. Some of the \\nstartups that postpone raising VC money may do so well on the angel money they raise that \\nthey never bother to raise more. And those who do raise VC rounds will be able to get higher \\nvaluations when they do. If the best startups get 10x higher valuations when they raise series A \\nrounds, that would cut VCs' returns from winners at least tenfold. [2]\\nSo I think VC funds are seriously threatened by the super-angels. But one thing that may save \\nthem to some extent is the uneven distribution of startup outcomes: practically all the returns \\nare concentrated in a few big successes.

But one thing that may save \\nthem to some extent is the uneven distribution of startup outcomes: practically all the returns \\nare concentrated in a few big successes. The expected value of a startup is the percentage \\nchance it's Google. So to the extent that winning is a matter of absolute returns, the super-\\nangels could win practically all the battles for individual startups and yet lose the war, if they \\nmerely failed to get those few big winners. And there's a chance that could happen, because \\nthe top VC funds have better brands, and can also do more for their portfolio companies. [3]\\nBecause super-angels make more investments per partner, they have less partner per \\ninvestment. They can't pay as much attention to you as a VC on your board could. How much is \\nthat extra attention worth? It will vary enormously from one partner to another. There's no \\nconsensus yet in the general case. So for now this is something startups are deciding \\nindividually.\\nTill \", \"\\nthat extra attention worth? It will vary enormously from one partner to another. There's no \\nconsensus yet in the general case. So for now this is something startups are deciding \\nindividually.\\nTill now, VCs' claims about how much value they added were sort of like the government's. \\nMaybe they made you feel better, but you had no choice in the matter, if you needed money on \\nthe scale only VCs could supply. Now that VCs have competitors, that's going to put a market \\nprice on the help they offer. The interesting thing is, no one knows yet what it will be.\\nDo startups that want to get really big need the sort of advice and connections only the top VCs \\ncan supply? Or would super-angel money do just as well? The VCs will say you need them, and \\nthe super-angels will say you don't.

The \\nwhole shape of deals is changing.\\nOne of the biggest differences between angels and VCs is the amount of your company they \\nwant. VCs want a lot. In a series A round they want a third of your company, if they can get it. \\nThey don't care much how much they pay for it, but they want a lot because the number of \\nseries A investments they can do is so small. In a traditional series A investment, at least one \\npartner from the VC fund takes a seat on your board. [4] Since board seats last about 5 years \\nand each partner can't handle more than about 10 at once, that\", \"itional series A investment, at least one \\npartner from the VC fund takes a seat on your board. [4] Since board seats last about 5 years \\nand each partner can't handle more than about 10 at once, that means a VC fund can only do \\nabout 2 series A deals per partner per year. And that means they need to get as much of the \\ncompany as they can in each one. You'd have to be a very promising startup indeed to get a VC \\nto use up one of his 10 board seats for only a few percent of you.\\nSince angels generally don't take board seats, they don't have this constraint. They're happy to \\nbuy only a few percent of you. And although the super-angels are in most respects mini VC \\nfunds, they've retained this critical property of angels. They don't take board seats, so they don't \\nneed a big percentage of your company.\\nThough that means you'll get correspondingly less attention from them, it's good news in other \\nrespects. Founders never really liked giving up as much equity as VCs wanted. It was a lo\", \" your company.\\nThough that means you'll get correspondingly less attention from them, it's good news in other \\nrespects. Founders never really liked giving up as much equity as VCs wanted. It was a lot of \\nthe company to give up in one shot. Most founders doing series A deals would prefer to take \\nhalf as much money for half as much stock, and then see what valuation they could get for the \\nsecond half of the stock after using the first half of the money to increase its value. But VCs \\nnever offered that option.\\nNow startups have another alternative. Now it's easy to raise angel rounds about half the size of \\nseries A rounds. Many of the startups we fund are taking this route, and I predict that will be \\ntrue of startups in general.\\nA typical big angel round might be $600k on a convertible note with a valuation cap of $4 million \\npremoney. Meaning that when the note converts into stock (in a later round, or upon \\nacquisition), the investors in that round will get .6 / 4.6, or 13% of th\", \" note with a valuation cap of $4 million \\npremoney. Meaning that when the note converts into stock (in a later round, or upon \\nacquisition), the investors in that round will get .6 / 4.6, or 13% of the company. That's a lot less \\nthan the 30 to 40% of the company you usually give up in a series A round if you do it so early. \\n[5]\\nBut the advantage of these medium-sized rounds is not just that they cause less dilution. You \\nalso lose less control. After an angel round, the founders almost always still have control of the \\ncompany, whereas after a series A round they often don't. The traditional board structure after a \\nseries A round is two founders, two VCs, and a (supposedly) neutral fifth person. Plus series A \\nterms usually give the investors a veto over various kinds of important decisions, including \\nselling the company. Founders usually have a lot of de facto control after a series A, as long as \\nthings are going well. But that's not the same as just being able to do what you wan\", \"ions, including \\nselling the company. Founders usually have a lot of de facto control after a series A, as long as \\nthings are going well. But that's not the same as just being able to do what you want, like you \\ncould before.\\nA third and quite significant advantage of angel rounds is that they're less stressful to raise. \\nRaising a traditional series A round has in the past taken weeks, if not months. When a VC firm \\ncan only do 2 deals per partner per year, they're careful about which they do. To get a traditional \\nseries A round you have to go through a series of meetings, culminating in a full partner \\nmeeting where the firm as a whole says yes or no. That's the really scary part for founders: not \\njust that series A rounds take so long, but at the end of this long process the VCs might still say \\nno. The chance of getting rejected after the full partner meeting averages about 25%. At some \\nfirms it's over 50%.\\nFortunately for founders, VCs have been getting a lot faster. Nowadays \", 't still say \\nno. The chance of getting rejected after the full partner meeting averages about 25%. At some \\nfirms it\\'s over 50%.\\nFortunately for founders, VCs have been getting a lot faster. Nowadays Valley VCs are more \\nlikely to take 2 weeks than 2 months. But they\\'re still not as fast as angels and super-angels, \\nthe most decisive of whom sometimes decide in hours.\\nRaising an angel round is not only quicker, but you get feedback as it progresses. An angel \\nround is not an all or nothing thing like a series A. It\\'s composed of multiple investors with \\nvarying degrees of seriousness, ranging from the upstanding ones who commit unequivocally \\nto the jerks who give you lines like \"come back to me to fill out the round.\" You usually start \\ncollecting money from the most committed investors and work your way out toward the \\nambivalent ones, whose interest increases as the round fills up.\\nBut at each point you know how you\\'re doing. If investors turn cold you may have to raise less, \\nbut w', 'nd work your way out toward the \\nambivalent ones, whose interest increases as the round fills up.\\nBut at each point you know how you\\'re doing. If investors turn cold you may have to raise less, \\nbut when investors in an angel round turn cold the process at least degrades gracefully, instead \\nof blowing up in your face and leaving you with nothing, as happens if you get rejected by a VC \\nfund after a full partner meeting. Whereas if investors seem hot, you can not only close the \\nround faster, but now that convertible notes are becoming the norm, actually raise the price to \\nreflect demand.\\nValuation\\nHowever, the VCs have a weapon they can use against the super-angels, and they have started \\nto use it. VCs have started making angel-sized investments too. The term \"angel round\" doesn\\'t \\nmean that all the investors in it are angels; it just describes the structure of the round. \\nIncreasingly the participants include VCs making investments of a hundred thousand or two. \\nAnd when VCs invest', \" that all the investors in it are angels; it just describes the structure of the round. \\nIncreasingly the participants include VCs making investments of a hundred thousand or two. \\nAnd when VCs invest in angel rounds they can do things that super-angels don't like. VCs are \\nquite valuation-insensitive in angel rounds—partly because they are in general, and partly \\nbecause they don't care that much about the returns on angel rounds, which they still view \\nmostly as a way to recruit startups for series A rounds later. So VCs who invest in angel rounds \\ncan blow up the valuations for angels and super-angels who invest in them. [6]\\nSome super-angels seem to care about valuations. Several turned down YC-funded startups \\nafter Demo Day because their valuations were too high. This was not a problem for the startups; \\nby definition a high valuation means enough investors were willing to accept it. But it was \\nmysterious to me that the super-angels would quibble about valuations. Did they not u\", \"em for the startups; \\nby definition a high valuation means enough investors were willing to accept it. But it was \\nmysterious to me that the super-angels would quibble about valuations. Did they not understand \\nthat the big returns come from a few big successes, and that it therefore mattered far more \\nwhich startups you picked than how much you paid for them?\\nAfter thinking about it for a while and observing certain other signs, I have a theory that \\nexplains why the super-angels may be smarter than they seem. It would make sense for super-\\nangels to want low valuations if they're hoping to invest in startups that get bought early. If \\nyou're hoping to hit the next Google, you shouldn't care if the valuation is 20 million. But if you're \\nlooking for companies that are going to get bought for 30 million, you care. If you invest at 20 \\nand the company gets bought for 30, you only get 1.5x. You might as well buy Apple.\\nSo if some of the super-angels were looking for companies that could \", 'for 30 million, you care. If you invest at 20 \\nand the company gets bought for 30, you only get 1.5x. You might as well buy Apple.\\nSo if some of the super-angels were looking for companies that could get acquired quickly, that \\nwould explain why they\\'d care about valuations. But why would they be looking for those? \\nBecause depending on the meaning of \"quickly,\" it could actually be very profitable. A company \\nthat gets acquired for 30 million is a failure to a VC, but it could be a 10x return for an angel, \\nand moreover, a quick 10x return. Rate of return is what matters in investing—not the multiple \\nyou get, but the multiple per year. If a super-angel gets 10x in one year, that\\'s a higher rate of \\nreturn than a VC could ever hope to get from a company that took 6 years to go public. To get \\nthe same rate of return, the VC would have to get a multiple of 10^6—one million x. Even \\nGoogle didn\\'t come close to that.\\nSo I think at least some super-angels are looking for companies that wi', \"get \\nthe same rate of return, the VC would have to get a multiple of 10^6—one million x. Even \\nGoogle didn't come close to that.\\nSo I think at least some super-angels are looking for companies that will get bought. That's the \\nonly rational explanation for focusing on getting the right valuations, instead of the right \\ncompanies. And if so they'll be different to deal with than VCs. They'll be tougher on valuations, \\nbut more accommodating if you want to sell early.\\nPrognosis\\nWho will win, the super-angels or the VCs? I think the answer to that is, some of each. They'll \\neach become more like one another. The super-angels will start to invest larger amounts, and \\nthe VCs will gradually figure out ways to make more, smaller investments faster. A decade from \\nnow the players will be hard to tell apart, and there will probably be survivors from each group.\\nWhat does that mean for founders?

One thing it means is that the high valuations startups are \\npresently getting may not last forever. To the extent that valuations are being driven up by price-\\ninsensitive VCs, they'll fall again if VCs become more like super-angels and start to become \\nmore miserly about valuations. Fortunately if this does happen it will take years.\\nThe short term forecast is more competition between investors, which is good news for you. \\nThe super-angels will try to undermine the VCs by acting faster, and the VCs will try to \\nundermine the super-angels by driving up valuations. Which for founders will result in the \\nperfect combination: funding rounds that close fast, with high valuations.\\nBut remember that to get that combination, your startup will have to appeal to both super-\\nangels and VCs.

If you don't seem like you have the potential to go public, you won't be able to \\nuse VCs to drive up the valuation of an angel round.\\nThere is a danger of having VCs in an angel round: the so-called signalling risk. If VCs are only \\ndoing it in the hope of investing more later, what happens if they don't? That's a signal to \\neveryone else that they think you're lame.\\nHow much should you worry about that? The seriousness of signalling risk depends on how far \\nalong you are. If by the next time you need to raise money, you have graphs showing rising \\nrevenue or traffic month after month, you don't have to worry about any signals your existing \\ninvestors are sending.

[7]\\nWhereas if the next time you need to raise money you won't yet have concrete results, you may \\nneed to think more about the message your investors might send if they don't invest more. I'm \\nnot sure yet how much you have to worry, because this whole phenomenon of VCs doing angel \\ninvestments is so new. But my instincts tell me you don't have to worry much. Signalling risk \\nsmells like one of those things founders worry about that's not a real problem. As a rule, the \\nonly thing that can kill a good startup is the startup itself. Startups hurt themselves way more \\noften than competitors hurt them, for example. I suspect signalling risk is in this category too.\\nOne thing YC-funded startups have been doing to mitigate the risk of taking money from VCs in \\nangel rounds is not to take too much from any one VC. Maybe that will help, if you have the \\nluxury of turning down money.\\nFortunately, more and more startups will. After decades of competition that could best be \\ndescribed a\", 'ke too much from any one VC. Maybe that will help, if you have the \\nluxury of turning down money.\\nFortunately, more and more startups will. After decades of competition that could best be \\ndescribed as intramural, the startup funding business is finally getting some real competition. \\nThat should last several years at least, and maybe a lot longer. Unless there\\'s some huge \\nmarket crash, the next couple years are going to be a good time for startups to raise money. \\nAnd that\\'s exciting because it means lots more startups will happen.\\nNotes:\\n[1] I\\'ve also heard them called \"Mini-VCs\" and \"Micro-VCs.\" I don\\'t know which name will stick.\\nThere were a couple predecessors. Ron Conway had angel funds starting in the 1990s, and in some ways First \\nRound Capital is closer to a super-angel than a VC fund.\\n[2] It wouldn\\'t cut their overall returns tenfold, because investing later would probably (a) cause them to lose less on \\ninvestments that failed, and (b) not allow them to get as large a perc', \"C fund.\\n[2] It wouldn't cut their overall returns tenfold, because investing later would probably (a) cause them to lose less on \\ninvestments that failed, and (b) not allow them to get as large a percentage of startups as they do now. So it's hard to \\npredict precisely what would happen to their returns.\\n[3] The brand of an investor derives mostly from the success of their portfolio companies. The top VCs thus have a \\nbig brand advantage over the super-angels. They could make it self-perpetuating if they used it to get all the best new \\nstartups. But I don't think they'll be able to. To get all the best startups, you have to do more than make them want \\nyou. You also have to want them; you have to recognize them when you see them, and that's much harder. Super-\\nangels will snap up stars that VCs miss. And that will cause the brand gap between the top VCs and the super-\\nangels gradually to erode.\\n[4] Though in a traditional series A round VCs put two partners on your board, there are si\", 'at VCs miss. And that will cause the brand gap between the top VCs and the super-\\nangels gradually to erode.\\n[4] Though in a traditional series A round VCs put two partners on your board, there are signs now that VCs may \\nbegin to conserve board seats by switching to what used to be considered an angel-round board, consisting of two \\nfounders and one VC. Which is also to the founders\\' advantage if it means they still control the company.\\n[5] In a series A round, you usually have to give up more than the actual amount of stock the VCs buy, because they \\ninsist you dilute yourselves to set aside an \"option pool\" as well. I predict this practice will gradually disappear though.\\n[6] The best thing for founders, if they can get it, is a convertible note with no valuation cap at all. In that case the \\nmoney invested in the angel round just converts into stock at the valuation of the next round, no matter how large. \\nAngels and super-angels tend not to like uncapped notes. They have no idea h', \"e the \\nmoney invested in the angel round just converts into stock at the valuation of the next round, no matter how large. \\nAngels and super-angels tend not to like uncapped notes.

If the company does well and the valuation of the next round is high, they may end up with only a sliver of it. \\nSo by agreeing to uncapped notes, VCs who don't care about valuations in angel rounds can make offers that super-\\nangels hate to match.\\n[7] Obviously signalling risk is also not a problem if you'll never need to raise more money.

Get funded by Y Combinator. \\n September 2010\\nThe reason startups have been using more convertible notes in angel rounds is that they make \\ndeals close faster. By making it easier for startups to give different prices to different investors, \\nthey help them break the sort of deadlock that happens when investors all wait to see who else \\nis going to invest.\\nBy far the biggest influenc', 'artups to give different prices to different investors, \\nthey help them break the sort of deadlock that happens when investors all wait to see who else \\nis going to invest.\\nBy far the biggest influence on investors\\' opinions of a startup is the opinion of other investors. \\nThere are very, very few who simply decide for themselves. Any startup founder can tell you the \\nmost common question they hear from investors is not about the founders or the product, but \\n\"who else is investing?\"\\nThat tends to produce deadlocks. Raising an old-fashioned fixed-size equity round can take \\nweeks, because all the angels sit around waiting for the others to commit, like competitors in a \\nbicycle sprint who deliberately ride slowly at the start so they can follow whoever breaks first.\\nConvertible notes let startups beat such deadlocks by rewarding investors willing to move first \\nwith lower (effective) valuations. Which they deserve because they\\'re taking more risk. It\\'s much \\nsafer to invest in a startu', \"tartups beat such deadlocks by rewarding investors willing to move first \\nwith lower (effective) valuations. Which they deserve because they're taking more risk. It's much \\nsafer to invest in a startup Ron Conway has already invested in; someone who comes after him \\nshould pay a higher price.\\nThe reason convertible notes allow more flexibility in price is that valuation caps aren't actual \\nvaluations, and notes are cheap and easy to do. So you can do high-resolution fundraising: if \\nyou wanted you could have a separate note with a different cap for each investor.\\nThat cap need not simply rise monotonically. A startup could also give better deals to investors \\nthey expected to help them most. The point is simply that different investors, whether because \\nof the help they offer or their willingness to commit, have different values for startups, and their \\nterms should reflect that.\\nDifferent terms for different investors is clearly the way of the future. Markets always evolve \\ntoward hig\", \"ingness to commit, have different values for startups, and their \\nterms should reflect that.\\nDifferent terms for different investors is clearly the way of the future. Markets always evolve \\ntoward higher resolution. You may not need to use convertible notes to do it. With sufficiently \\nlightweight standardized equity terms (and some changes in investors' and lawyers' \\nexpectations about equity rounds) you might be able to do the same thing with equity instead of \\ndebt. Either would be fine with startups, so long as they can easily change their valuation.\\nDeadlocks weren't the only problem with fixed-size equity rounds. Another was that startups \\nhad to decide in advance how much to raise. I think it's a mistake for a startup to fix upon a \\nspecific number. If investors are easily convinced, the startup should raise more now, and if \\ninvestors are skeptical, the startup should take a smaller amount and use that to get the \\ncompany to the point where it's more convincing.\\nIt's just not r\", \", the startup should raise more now, and if \\ninvestors are skeptical, the startup should take a smaller amount and use that to get the \\ncompany to the point where it's more convincing.\\nIt's just not reasonable to expect startups to pick an optimal round size in advance, because \\nthat depends on the reactions of investors, and those are impossible to predict.\\nFixed-size, multi-investor angel rounds are such a bad idea for startups that one wonders why \\nthings were ever done that way. One possibility is that this custom reflects the way investors like \\nto collude when they can get away with it. But I think the actual explanation is less sinister. I \\nthink angels (and their lawyers) organized rounds this way in unthinking imitation of VC series A \\nrounds. In a series A, a fixed-size equity round with a lead makes sense, because there is \\nusually just one big investor, who is unequivocally the lead. Fixed-size series A rounds already \\nare high res. But the more investors you have in a roun\", 'und with a lead makes sense, because there is \\nusually just one big investor, who is unequivocally the lead. Fixed-size series A rounds already \\nare high res. But the more investors you have in a round, the less sense it makes for everyone \\nto get the same price.\\nThe most interesting question here may be what high res fundraising will do to the world of \\ninvestors. Bolder investors will now get rewarded with lower prices. But more important, in a hits-\\ndriven business, is that they\\'ll be able to get into the deals they want. Whereas the \"who else is \\ninvesting?\" type of investors will not only pay higher prices, but may not be able to get into the \\nbest deals at all.\\nThanks to Immad Akhund, Sam Altman, John Bautista, Pete Koomen, Jessica Livingston, Dan \\nSiroker, Harj Taggar, and Fred Wilson for reading drafts of this.\\nWhat Happened to Yahoo  - # 129\\n Want to start a startup?

It was supposed to be what Google turned out \\nto be.\\nWhat went wrong? The problems that hosed Yahoo go back a long time, practically to the \\nbeginning of the company. They were already very visible when I got there in 1998. Yahoo had \\ntwo problems Google didn't: easy money, and ambivalence about being a technology company.\\nMoney\\nThe first time I met Jerry Yang, we thought we were meeting for different reasons. He thought \\nwe were meeting so he could check us out in person before buying us. I thought we were \\nmeeting so we could show him our new technology, Revenue Loop. It was a way of sorting \\nshopping search results.

It was a way of sorting \\nshopping search results. Merchants bid a percentage of sales for traffic, but the results were \\nsorted not by the bid but by the bid times the average amount a user would buy. It was like the \\nalgorithm Google uses now to sort ads, but this was in the spring of 1998, before Google was \\nfounded.\\nRevenue Loop was the optimal sort for shopping search, in the sense that it sorted in order of \\nhow much money Yahoo would make from each link. But it wasn't just optimal in that sense. \\nRanking search results by user behavior also makes search better. Users train the search: you \\ncan start out finding matches based on mere textual similarity, and as users buy more stuff the \\nsearch results get better and better.\\nJerry didn't seem to care. I was confused. I was showing him technology that extracted the \\nmaximum value from search traffic, and he didn't care?

I was showing him technology that extracted the \\nmaximum value from search traffic, and he didn't care? I couldn't tell whether I was explaining it \\nbadly, or he was just very poker faced.\\nI didn't realize the answer till later, after I went to work at Yahoo. It was neither of my guesses. \\nThe reason Yahoo didn't care about a technique that extracted the full value of traffic was that \\nadvertisers were already overpaying for it. If Yahoo merely extracted the actual value, they'd \\nhave made less.\\nHard as it is to believe now, the big money then was in banner ads. Advertisers were willing to \\npay ridiculous amounts for banner ads. So Yahoo's sales force had evolved to exploit this \\nsource of revenue. Led by a large and terrifyingly formidable man called Anil Singh, Yahoo's \\nsales guys would fly out to Procter & Gamble and come back with million dollar orders for \\nbanner ad impressions.\\nThe prices seemed cheap compared to print, which was what advert\", ' Anil Singh, Yahoo\\'s \\nsales guys would fly out to Procter & Gamble and come back with million dollar orders for \\nbanner ad impressions.\\nThe prices seemed cheap compared to print, which was what advertisers, for lack of any other \\nreference, compared them to. But they were expensive compared to what they were worth. So \\nthese big, dumb companies were a dangerous source of revenue to depend on. But there was \\nanother source even more dangerous: other Internet startups.\\nBy 1998, Yahoo was the beneficiary of a de facto Ponzi scheme. Investors were excited about \\nthe Internet. One reason they were excited was Yahoo\\'s revenue growth. So they invested in \\nnew Internet startups. The startups then used the money to buy ads on Yahoo to get traffic. \\nWhich caused yet more revenue growth for Yahoo, and further convinced investors the Internet \\nwas worth investing in. When I realized this one day, sitting in my cubicle, I jumped up like \\nArchimedes in his bathtub, except instead of \"Eureka!\" I was ', 'd further convinced investors the Internet \\nwas worth investing in. When I realized this one day, sitting in my cubicle, I jumped up like \\nArchimedes in his bathtub, except instead of \"Eureka!\" I was shouting \"Sell!\"\\nBoth the Internet startups and the Procter & Gambles were doing brand advertising. They didn\\'t \\ncare about targeting. They just wanted lots of people to see their ads. So traffic became the \\nthing to get at Yahoo. It didn\\'t matter what type. [1]\\nIt wasn\\'t just Yahoo. All the search engines were doing it. This was why they were trying to get \\npeople to start calling them \"portals\" instead of \"search engines.\" Despite the actual meaning of \\nthe word portal, what they meant by it was a site where users would find what they wanted on \\nthe site itself, instead of just passing through on their way to other destinations, as they did at a \\nsearch engine.\\nI remember telling David Filo in late 1998 or early 1999 that Yahoo should buy Google, because \\nI and most of the other programm', 'gh on their way to other destinations, as they did at a \\nsearch engine.\\nI remember telling David Filo in late 1998 or early 1999 that Yahoo should buy Google, because \\nI and most of the other programmers in the company were using it instead of Yahoo for search. \\nHe told me that it wasn\\'t worth worrying about. Search was only 6% of our traffic, and we were \\ngrowing at 10% a month. It wasn\\'t worth doing better.\\nI didn\\'t say \"But search traffic is worth more than other traffic!\" I said \"Oh, ok.\" Because I didn\\'t \\nrealize either how much search traffic was worth. I\\'m not sure even Larry and Sergey did then. If \\nthey had, Google presumably wouldn\\'t have expended any effort on enterprise search.\\nIf circumstances had been different, the people running Yahoo might have realized sooner how \\nimportant search was.

They\\'d been \\nthrown off balance from the start by their ambivalence about being a technology company.\\nOne of the weirdest things about Yahoo when I went to work there was the way they insisted on \\ncalling themselves a \"media company.\" If you walked around their offices, it seemed like a \\nsoftware company. The cubicles were full of programmers writing code, product managers \\nthinking about feature lists and ship dates, support people (yes, there were actually support \\npeople) telling users to restart their browsers, and so on, just like a software company.

Technology companies made money by selling \\ntheir software to users. Media companies sold ads. So they must be a media company.\\nAnother big factor was the fear of Microsoft. If anyone at Yahoo considered the idea that they \\nshould be a technology company, the next thought would have been that Microsoft would crush \\nthem.\\nIt's hard for anyone much younger than me to understand the fear Microsoft still inspired in \\n1995. Imagine a company with several times the power Google has now, but way meaner. It \\nwas perfectly reasonable to be afraid of them. Yahoo watched them crush the first hot Internet \\ncompany, Netscape. It was reasonable to worry that if they tried to be the next Netscape, they'd \\nsuffer the same fate.

But unfortunately Yahoo actually tried to be one, sort of. Project managers at Yahoo were \\ncalled \"producers,\" for example, and the different parts of the company were called \"properties.\" \\nBut what Yahoo really needed to be was a technology company, and by trying to be something \\nelse, they ended up being something that was neither here nor there. That\\'s why Yahoo as a \\ncompany has never had a sharply defined identity.\\nThe worst consequence of trying to be a media company was that they didn\\'t take programming \\nseriously enough.

Microsoft (back in the day), Google, and Facebook have all had hacker-\\ncentric cultures. But Yahoo treated programming as a commodity. At Yahoo, user-facing \\nsoftware was controlled by product managers and designers. The job of programmers was just \\nto take the work of the product managers and designers the final step, by translating it into code.\\nOne obvious result of this practice was that when Yahoo built things, they often weren't very \\ngood. But that wasn't the worst problem. The worst problem was that they hired bad \\nprogrammers.\\nMicrosoft (back in the day), Google, and Facebook have all been obsessed with hiring the best \\nprogrammers. Yahoo wasn't.

And when you consider how much competition there was for \\nprogrammers when they were hiring, during the Bubble, it's not surprising that the quality of \\ntheir programmers was uneven.\\nIn technology, once you have bad programmers, you're doomed. I can't think of an instance \\nwhere a company has sunk into technical mediocrity and recovered. Good programmers want \\nto work with other good programmers. So once the quality of programmers at your company \\nstarts to drop, you enter a death spiral from which there is no recovery. [2]\\nAt Yahoo this death spiral started early. If there was ever a time when Yahoo was a Google-style \\ntalent magnet, it was over by the time I got there in 1998.\\nThe company felt prematurely old.

It was still very much a hacker-centric \\nculture. I remember talking to some programmers in the cafeteria about the problem of gaming \\nsearch results (now known as SEO), and they asked \"what should we do?\" Programmers at \\nYahoo wouldn\\'t have asked that.

In the software business, you can\\'t afford \\nnot to have a hacker-centric culture.\\nProbably the most impressive commitment I\\'ve heard to having a hacker-centric culture came \\nfrom Mark Zuckerberg, when he spoke at Startup School in 2007.

Increasingly, \\nstartups want a couple hundred thousand dollars, not a couple million. [1]\\nThe opportunity is a lot less unexploited now. Investors have poured into this territory from both \\ndirections. VCs are much more likely to make angel-sized investments than they were a year \\nago. And meanwhile the past year has seen a dramatic increase in a new type of investor: the \\nsuper-angel, who operates like an angel, but using other people\\'s money, like a VC.\\nThough a lot of investors are entering this territory, there is still room for more.

So \\nthere should be a lot more people investing tens or hundreds of thousands than millions. [2]\\nIn fact, it may be good for angels that there are more people doing angel-sized deals, because \\nif angel rounds become more legitimate, then startups may start to opt for angel rounds even \\nwhen they could, if they wanted, raise series A rounds from VCs. One reason startups prefer \\nseries A rounds is that they're more prestigious. But if angel investors become more active and \\nbetter known, they'll increasingly be able to compete with VCs in brand.\\nOf course, prestige isn't the main reason to prefer a series A round.

Angel rounds are their whole business, as \\nonline video was for YouTube. Whereas VCs who make angel investments mostly do it as a way \\nto generate deal flow for series A rounds. [4]\\nOn the other hand, startup investing is a very strange business. Nearly all the returns are \\nconcentrated in a few big winners. If the super-angels merely fail to invest in (and to some \\nextent produce) the big winners, they'll be out of business, even if they invest in all the others.\\nVCs\\nWhy don't VCs start doing smaller series A rounds? The sticking point is board seats. In a \\ntraditional series A round, the partner whose deal it is takes a seat on the startup's board.

You don't have to be on \\nthe board to help a startup. Maybe VCs feel they need the power that comes with board \\nmembership to ensure their money isn't wasted. But have they tested that theory? Unless \\nthey've tried not taking board seats and found their returns are lower, they're not bracketing the \\nproblem.\\nI'm not saying VCs don't help startups. The good ones help them a lot. What I'm saying is that \\nthe kind of help that matters, you may not have to be a board member to give. [5]\\nHow will this all play out? Some VCs will probably adapt, by doing more, smaller deals.

VCs are conservative, and the \\nthreat to them isn't mortal. The VC funds that don't adapt won't be violently displaced. They'll \\nedge gradually into a different business without realizing it. They'll still do what they will call \\nseries A rounds, but these will increasingly be de facto series B rounds. [6]\\nIn such rounds they won't get the 25 to 40% of the company they do now.

[7] And though there's going to be one investor who gives them the first check, and his \\nor her help in recruiting other investors will certainly be welcome, this initial investor will no \\nlonger be the lead in the old sense of managing the round. The startup will now do that \\nthemselves.\\nThere will continue to be lead investors in the sense of investors who take the lead in advising a \\nstartup. They may also make th\", \"ense of managing the round.

But they won't always have to be the one \\nterms are negotiated with, or be the first money in, as they have in the past. Standardized \\npaperwork will do away with the need to negotiate anything except the valuation, and that will \\nget easier too.\\nIf multiple investors have to share a valuation, it will be whatever the startup can get from the \\nfirst one to write a check, limited by their guess at whether this will make later investors balk. \\nBut there may not have to be just one valuation. Startups are increasingly raising money on \\nconvertible notes, and convertible notes have not valuations but at most valuation caps: caps on \\nwhat the effective valuation will be when the debt converts to equity (in a later round, or upon \\nacquisition if that happens first). That's \", \"s have not valuations but at most valuation caps: caps on \\nwhat the effective valuation will be when the debt converts to equity (in a later round, or upon \\nacquisition if that happens first). That's an important difference because it means a startup \\ncould do multiple notes at once with different caps. This is now starting to happen, and I predict \\nit will become more common.\\nSheep\\nThe reason things are moving this way is that the old way sucked for startups. Leads could (and \\ndid) use a fixed size round as a legitimate-seeming way of saying what all founders hate to \\nhear: I'll invest if other people will. Most investors, unable to judge startups for themselves, rely \\ninstead on the opinions of other investors. If everyone wants in, they want in too; if not, not. \\nFounders hate this because it's a recipe for deadlock, and delay is the thing a startup can least \\nafford. Most investors know this m.o. is lame, and few say openly that they're doing it.

How could they go \\nahead with the deal? The startup would be underfunded!\\nIn the future, investors will increasingly be unable to offer investment subject to contingencies \\nlike other people investing. Or rather, investors who do that will get last place in line. Startups \\nwill go to them only to fill up rounds that are mostly subscribed. And since hot startups tend to \\nhave rounds that are oversubscribed, being last in line means they'll probably miss the hot \\ndeals. Hot deals and successful startups are not identical, but there is a significant correlation. \\n[8] So investors who won't invest unilaterally will have lower returns.\\nInvestors w\", \"y miss the hot \\ndeals.

Chasing hot \\ndeals doesn't make investors choose better; it just makes them feel better about their choices. \\nI've seen feeding frenzies both form and fall apart many times, and as far as I can tell they're \\nmostly random. [9] If investors can no longer rely on their herd instincts, they'll have to think \\nmore about each startup before investing. They may be surprised how well this works.\\nDeadlock wasn't the only disadvantage of letting a lead investor manage an angel round. The \\ninvestors would not infrequently collude to push down the valuation. And rounds took too long to \\nclose, because however motivated the lead was to get the round closed, he was not a tenth as \\nmotivated as the startup.\\nIncreasingly, startups are \", \"ush down the valuation. And rounds took too long to \\nclose, because however motivated the lead was to get the round closed, he was not a tenth as \\nmotivated as the startup.\\nIncreasingly, startups are taking charge of their own angel rounds. Only a few do so far, but I \\nthink we can already declare the old way dead, because those few are the best startups. \\nThey're the ones in a position to tell investors how the round is going to work. And if the \\nstartups you want to invest in do things a certain way, what difference does it make what the \\nothers do?\\nTraction\\nIn fact, it may be slightly misleading to say that angel rounds will increasingly take the place of \\nseries A rounds. What's really happening is that startup-controlled rounds are taking the place \\nof investor-controlled rounds.\\nThis is an instance of a very important meta-trend, one that Y Combinator itself has been \\nbased on from the beginning: founders are becoming increasingly powerful relative to investors. \\nSo if you want t\", ' is an instance of a very important meta-trend, one that Y Combinator itself has been \\nbased on from the beginning: founders are becoming increasingly powerful relative to investors. \\nSo if you want to predict what the future of venture funding will be like, just ask: how would \\nfounders like it to be? One by one, all the things founders dislike about raising money are going \\nto get eliminated. [10]\\nUsing that heuristic, I\\'ll predict a couple more things. One is that investors will increasingly be \\nunable to wait for startups to have \"traction\" before they put in significant money. It\\'s hard to \\npredict in advance which startups will succeed. So most investors prefer, if they can, to wait till \\nthe startup is already succeeding, then jump in quickly with an offer. Startups hate this as well, \\npartly because it tends to create deadlock, and partly because it seems kind of slimy.

Then when \\nyou start to see growth, they claim they were your friend all along, and are aghast at the \\nthought you'd be so disloyal as to leave them out of your round. If founders become more \\npowerful, they'll be able to make investors give them more money upfront.\\n(The worst variant of this behavior is the tranched deal, where the investor makes a small initial \\ninvestment, with more to follow if the startup does well. In effect, this structure gives the investor \\na free option on the next round, which they'll only take if it's worse for the startup than they \\ncould get in the open market. Tranched deals are an abuse. They're increasingly rare, and \\nthey're going to get rarer.)

So as founders \\nbecome more powerful, rounds should start to close faster.\\nFundraising is still terribly distracting for startups. If you're a founder in the middle of raising a \\nround, the round is the top idea in your mind, which means working on the com\", \"t to close faster.\\nFundraising is still terribly distracting for startups. If you're a founder in the middle of raising a \\nround, the round is the top idea in your mind, which means working on the company isn't. If a \\nround takes 2 months to close, which is reasonably fast by present standards, that means 2 \\nmonths during which the company is basically treading water. That's the worst thing a startup \\ncould do.\\nSo if investors want to get the best deals, the way to do it will be to close faster. Investors don't \\nneed weeks to make up their minds anyway. We decide based on about 10 minutes of reading \\nan application plus 10 minutes of in person interview, and we only regret about 10% of our \\ndecisions. If we can decide in 20 minutes, surely the next round of investors can decide in a \\ncouple days.

[12]\\nThere are a lot of institutionalized delays in startup funding: the multi-week mating dance with \\ninvestors; the distinction between termsheets and deals; the fact that each series A has \\nenormously elaborate, custom paperwork. Both founders and investors tend to take these for \\ngranted. It's the way things have always been. But ultimately the reason these delays exist is \\nthat they're to the advantage of investors. More time gives investors more information about a \\nstartup's trajectory, and it also tends to make startups more pliable in negotiations, since they're \\nusually short of money.\\nThese conventions weren't designed to drag out the funding process, but that's why they're \\nallowed to persist. Slowness is to the advantage of investors, who have in the past been the \\nones with the most power.

The future is simple deals with standard terms, done quickly.\\nOne minor abuse that will get corrected in the process is option pools. In a traditional series A \\nround, before the VCs invest they make the company set aside a block of stock for future hires—\\nusually between 10 and 30% of the company. The point is to ensure this dilution is borne by the \\nexisting shareholders. The practice isn't dishonest; founders know what's going on. But it makes \\ndeals unnecessarily complicated. In effect the valuation is 2 numbers. There's no need to keep \\ndoing this. [13]\\nThe final thing founders want is to be able to sell some of their own stock in later rounds.

Now the good news: investors may actually make more money as a result.\\nA couple days ago an interviewer asked me if founders having more power would be better or \\nworse for the world. I was surprised, because I'd never considered that question. Better or \\nworse, it's happening. But after a second's reflection, the answer seemed obvious.

In a lot of startups, the biggest source of stress for the founders is not \\ncompetitors but investors. Certainly it was for us at Viaweb. And this is not a new phenomenon: \\ninvestors were James Watt's biggest problem too. If having less power prevents investors from \\novercontrolling startups, it should be better not just for founders but for investors too.\\nInvestors may end up with less stock per startup, but startups will probably do better with \\nfounders more in control, and there will almost certainly be more of them.

An unbiased review would go something like this: Starting a \\nstartup gives you more freedom and the opportunity to make a lot more money than a job, but \\nit's also hard work and at times very stressful. Much of the stress comes from dealing with \\ninvestors. If reforming the investment process removed that stress, we'd make our product \\nmuch more attractive.

It's not going to happen unless you let it \\nbecome the thing you think about in the shower. And then you'll make little progress on anything \\nelse you'd rather be working on.

Professors nowadays seem to have \\nbecome professional fundraisers who do a little research on the side. It may be time to fix that.)\\nThe reason this struck me so forcibly is that for most of the preceding 10 years I'd been able to \\nthink about what I wanted. So the contrast when I couldn't was sharp. But I don't think this \\nproblem is unique to me, because just about every startup I've seen grinds to a halt when they \\nstart raising money ÿý or talking to acquirers.\\nYou can't directly control where your thoughts drift. If you're controlling them, they're not drifting. \\nBut you can control them indirectly, by controlling what situations you let yourself get into.

An emergency could push other thoughts out of \\nyour head. But barring emergencies you have a good deal of indirect control over what \\nbecomes the top idea in your mind.\\nI've found there are two types of thoughts especially worth avoiding ÿý thoughts like the Nile \\nPerch in the way they push out more interesting ideas. One I've already mentioned: thoughts \\nabout money. Getting money is almost by definition an attention sink. The other is disputes. \\nThese too are engaging in the wrong way: they have the same velcro-like shape as genuinely \\ninteresting ideas, but without the substance. So avoid disputes if you want to get real work \\ndone. [3]\\nEven Newton fell into this trap. After publishing his theory of colors in 1672 he found him\", 'ely \\ninteresting ideas, but without the substance. So avoid disputes if you want to get real work \\ndone. [3]\\nEven Newton fell into this trap. After publishing his theory of colors in 1672 he found himself \\ndistracted by disputes for years, finally concluding that the only solution was to stop publishing: I \\nsee I have made myself a slave to Philosophy, but if I get free of Mr Linus\\'s business I will \\nresolutely bid adew to it eternally, excepting what I do for my privat satisfaction or leave to come \\nout after me. For I see a man must either resolve to put out nothing new or become a slave to \\ndefend it. [4] Linus and his students at Liege were among the more tenacious critics. Newton\\'s \\nbiographer Westfall seems to feel he was overreacting: Recall that at the time he wrote, \\nNewton\\'s \"slavery\" consisted of five replies to Liege, totalling fourteen printed pages, over the \\ncourse of a year. I\\'m more sympathetic to Newton.

Someone who does you an injury \\nhurts you twice: first by the injury itself, and second by taking up your time afterward thinking \\nabout it. If you learn to ignore injuries you can at least avoid the second half. I\\'ve found I can to \\nsome extent avoid thinking about nasty things people have done to me by telling myself: this \\ndoesn\\'t deserve space in my head.

I now had to think about \\nsomething I hadn't had to think about before: how not to lose it. I knew it was possible to go \\nfrom rich to poor, just as it was possible to go from poor to rich. But while I'd spent a lot of the \\npast several years studying the paths from poor to rich, I knew practically nothing about the \\npaths from rich to poor.

Now, in order to avoid them, I had to learn where they were.\\nSo I started to pay attention to how fortunes are lost. If you\\'d asked me as a kid how rich people \\nbecame poor, I\\'d have said by spending all their money. That\\'s how it happens in books and \\nmovies, because that\\'s the colorful way to do it. But in fact the way most fortunes are lost is not \\nthrough excessive expenditure, but through bad investments.\\nIt\\'s hard to spend a fortune without noticing. Someone with ordinary tastes would find it hard to \\nblow through more than a few tens of thousands of dollars without thinking \"wow, I\\'m spending \\na lot of money.\" Whereas if you start trading derivatives, you can lose a million dollars (as much \\nas you want, really) in the blink of an eye.\\nIn most people\\'s minds, spending money on luxuries sets off alarms that making investments \\ndoesn\\'t. Lux', 'ivatives, you can lose a million dollars (as much \\nas you want, really) in the blink of an eye.\\nIn most people\\'s minds, spending money on luxuries sets off alarms that making investments \\ndoesn\\'t. Luxuries seem self-indulgent. And unless you got the money by inheriting it or winning \\na lottery, you\\'ve already been thoroughly trained that self-indulgence leads to trouble. Investing \\nbypasses those alarms. You\\'re not spending the money; you\\'re just moving it from one asset to \\nanother. Which is why people trying to sell you expensive things say \"it\\'s an investment.\"\\nThe solution is to develop new alarms. This can be a tricky business, because while the alarms \\nthat prevent you from overspending are so basic that they may even be in our DNA, the ones \\nthat prevent you from making bad investments have to be learned, and are sometimes fairly \\ncounterintuitive.\\nA few days ago I realized something surprising: the situation with time is much the same as with \\nmoney. The most dangerous way to l', \"nts have to be learned, and are sometimes fairly \\ncounterintuitive.\\nA few days ago I realized something surprising: the situation with time is much the same as with \\nmoney. The most dangerous way to lose time is not to spend it having fun, but to spend it doing \\nfake work. When you spend time having fun, you know you're being self-indulgent. Alarms start \\nto go off fairly quickly. If I woke up one morning and sat down on the sofa and watched TV all \\nday, I'd feel like something was terribly wrong. Just thinking about it makes me wince. I'd start to \\nfeel uncomfortable after sitting on a sofa watching TV for 2 hours, let alone a whole day.\\nAnd yet I've definitely had days when I might as well have sat in front of a TV all day — days at \\nthe end of which, if I asked myself what I got done that day, the answer would have been: \\nbasically, nothing. I feel bad after these days too, but nothing like as bad as I'd feel if I spent the \\nwhole day on the sofa watching TV. If I spent a whole day \", \"at day, the answer would have been: \\nbasically, nothing. I feel bad after these days too, but nothing like as bad as I'd feel if I spent the \\nwhole day on the sofa watching TV. If I spent a whole day watching TV I'd feel like I was \\ndescending into perdition. But the same alarms don't go off on the days when I get nothing \\ndone, because I'm doing stuff that seems, superficially, like real work. Dealing with email, for \\nexample. You do it sitting at a desk. It's not fun. So it must be work.\\nWith time, as with money, avoiding pleasure is no longer enough to protect you. It probably was \\nenough to protect hunter-gatherers, and perhaps all pre-industrial societies. So nature and \\nnurture combine to make us avoid self-indulgence.

Get funded by Y Combinator. \\n April 2010\\nThe best way to come up with startup ideas is to ask yourself the question: what do you wish \\nsomeone would make for you?\\nThere are two types of startup ideas: those that grow organically out of your own life, and those \\nthat you decide, from afar, are going to be necessary to some class of users other than you. \\nApple was the first type. Apple happened because Steve Wozniak wanted a computer. Unlike \\nmost people who wanted computers, he could design one, so he did. And since lots of other \\npeople wanted the same thing, Apple was able to sell enough of them to get the company \\nrolling. They still rely on this principle\", 'd computers, he could design one, so he did. And since lots of other \\npeople wanted the same thing, Apple was able to sell enough of them to get the company \\nrolling. They still rely on this principle today, incidentally. The iPhone is the phone Steve Jobs \\nwants. [1]\\nOur own startup, Viaweb, was of the second type. We made software for building online stores. \\nWe didn\\'t need this software ourselves. We weren\\'t direct marketers. We didn\\'t even know when \\nwe started that our users were called \"direct marketers.\" But we were comparatively old when \\nwe started the company (I was 30 and Robert Morris was 29), so we\\'d seen enough to know \\nusers would need this type of software. [2]\\nThere is no sharp line between the two types of ideas, but the most successful startups seem \\nto be closer to the Apple type than the Viaweb type. When he was writing that first Basic \\ninterpreter for the Altair, Bill Gates was writing something he would use, as were Larry and \\nSergey when they wrote the first ve', \"Apple type than the Viaweb type. When he was writing that first Basic \\ninterpreter for the Altair, Bill Gates was writing something he would use, as were Larry and \\nSergey when they wrote the first versions of Google.\\nOrganic ideas are generally preferable to the made up kind, but particularly so when the \\nfounders are young. It takes experience to predict what other people will want. The worst ideas \\nwe see at Y Combinator are from young founders making things they think other people will \\nwant.\\nSo if you want to start a startup and don't know yet what you're going to do, I'd encourage you \\nto focus initially on organic ideas. What's missing or broken in your daily life? Sometimes if you \\njust ask that question you'll get immediate answers. It must have seemed obviously broken to \\nBill Gates that you could only program the Altair in machine language.\\nYou may need to stand outside yourself a bit to see brokenness, because you tend to get used \\nto it and take it for granted. You can be \", \"tes that you could only program the Altair in machine language.\\nYou may need to stand outside yourself a bit to see brokenness, because you tend to get used \\nto it and take it for granted. You can be sure it's there, though. There are always great ideas \\nsitting right under our noses. In 2004 it was ridiculous that Harvard undergrads were still using a \\nFacebook printed on paper. Surely that sort of thing should have been online.\\nThere are ideas that obvious lying around now. The reason you're overlooking them is the same \\nreason you'd have overlooked the idea of building Facebook in 2004: organic startup ideas \\nusually don't seem like startup ideas at first. We know now that Facebook was very successful, \\nbut put yourself back in 2004. Putting undergraduates' profiles online wouldn't have seemed like \\nmuch of a startup idea. And in fact, it wasn't initially a startup idea. When Mark spoke at a YC \\ndinner this winter he said he wasn't trying to start a company when he wrote the first v\", ' seemed like \\nmuch of a startup idea. And in fact, it wasn\\'t initially a startup idea. When Mark spoke at a YC \\ndinner this winter he said he wasn\\'t trying to start a company when he wrote the first version of \\nFacebook. It was just a project. So was the Apple I when Woz first started working on it. He \\ndidn\\'t think he was starting a company. If these guys had thought they were starting companies, \\nthey might have been tempted to do something more \"serious,\" and that would have been a \\nmistake.\\nSo if you want to come up with organic startup ideas, I\\'d encourage you to focus more on the \\nidea part and less on the startup part. Just fix things that seem broken, regardless of whether it \\nseems like the problem is important enough to build a company on. If you keep pursuing such \\nthreads it would be hard not to end up making something of value to a lot of people, and when \\nyou do, surprise, you\\'ve got a company. [3]\\nDon\\'t be discouraged if what you produce initially is something other peop', \"uld be hard not to end up making something of value to a lot of people, and when \\nyou do, surprise, you've got a company. [3]\\nDon't be discouraged if what you produce initially is something other people dismiss as a toy. In \\nfact, that's a good sign. That's probably why everyone else has been overlooking the idea. The \\nfirst microcomputers were dismissed as toys. And the first planes, and the first cars. At this \\npoint, when someone comes to us with something that users like but that we could envision \\nforum trolls dismissing as a toy, it makes us especially likely to invest.\\nWhile young founders are at a disadvantage when coming up with made-up ideas, they're the \\nbest source of organic ones, because they're at the forefront of technology. They use the latest \\nstuff. They only just decided what to use, so why wouldn't they? And because they use the \\nlatest stuff, they're in a position to discover valuable types of fixable brokenness first.\\nThere's nothing more valuable than an unmet n\", \"d what to use, so why wouldn't they? And because they use the \\nlatest stuff, they're in a position to discover valuable types of fixable brokenness first.\\nThere's nothing more valuable than an unmet need that is just becoming fixable. If you find \\nsomething broken that you can fix for a lot of people, you've found a gold mine. As with an \\nactual gold mine, you still have to work hard to get the gold out of it. But at least you know \\nwhere the seam is, and that's the hard part.\\nNotes:\\n[1] This suggests a way to predict areas where Apple will be weak: things Steve Jobs doesn't use. E.g. I doubt he is \\nmuch into gaming.\\n[2] In retrospect, we should have become direct marketers. If I were doing Viaweb again, I'd open our own online \\nstore. If we had, we'd have understood users a lot better. I'd encourage anyone starting a startup to become one of \\nits users, however unnatural it seems.\\n[3] Possible exception: It's hard to compete directly with open source software. You can build things for\", \"d encourage anyone starting a startup to become one of \\nits users, however unnatural it seems.\\n[3] Possible exception: It's hard to compete directly with open source software.

Their fundamental problem is that they don\\'t understand \\nsoftware.\\nThey treat iPhone apps the way they treat the music they sell through iTunes. Apple is the \\nchannel; they own the user; if you want to reach users, you do it on their terms. The record \\nlabels agreed, reluctantly. But this model doesn\\'t work for software. It doesn\\'t work for an \\nintermediary to own the user. The software business learned that in the early 1980s, when \\ncompanies like VisiCorp showed that although the words \"software\" and \"publisher\" fit together, \\nthe underlying concepts don\\'t.

Software isn\\'t like music or books. It\\'s too complicated for a third \\nparty to act as an intermediary between developer and user. And yet that\\'s what Apple is trying \\nto be with the App Store: a software publisher. And a particularly overreaching one at that, with \\nfussy tastes and a rigidly enforced house style.\\nIf software publishing didn\\'t work in 1980, it works even less now that software development has \\nevolved from a small number of big releases to a constant stream of small ones. But Apple \\ndoesn\\'t understand that either. Their model of product development derives from hardware. \\nThey work on something till they think it\\'s finished, then they release it. You have to do that with \\nhardware, but because software is so easy to change, its design can benefit from evolution. The \\nstandard way to develop applications n', \"k it's finished, then they release it. You have to do that with \\nhardware, but because software is so easy to change, its design can benefit from evolution. The \\nstandard way to develop applications now is to launch fast and iterate. Which means it's a \\ndisaster to have long, random delays each time you release a new version.\\nApparently Apple's attitude is that developers should be more careful when they submit a new \\nversion to the App Store. They would say that. But powerful as they are, they're not powerful \\nenough to turn back the evolution of technology. Programmers don't use launch-fast-and-iterate \\nout of laziness. They use it because it yields the best results. By obstructing that process, Apple \\nis making them do bad work, and programmers hate that as much as Apple would.\\nHow would Apple like it if when they discovered a serious bug in OS X, instead of releasing a \\nsoftware update immediately, they had to submit their code to an intermediary who sat on it for \\na month and then\", 'd Apple like it if when they discovered a serious bug in OS X, instead of releasing a \\nsoftware update immediately, they had to submit their code to an intermediary who sat on it for \\na month and then rejected it because it contained an icon they didn\\'t like?\\nBy breaking software development, Apple gets the opposite of what they intended: the version \\nof an app currently available in the App Store tends to be an old and buggy one. One developer \\ntold me: As a result of their process, the App Store is full of half-baked applications. I make a \\nnew version almost every day that I release to beta users. The version on the App Store feels \\nold and crappy. I\\'m sure that a lot of developers feel this way: One emotion is \"I\\'m not really \\nproud about what\\'s in the App Store\", and it\\'s combined with the emotion \"Really, it\\'s Apple\\'s \\nfault.\" Another wrote: I believe that they think their approval process helps users by ensuring \\nquality.

In reality, bugs like ours get through all the time and then it can take 4-8 weeks to get \\nthat bug fix approved, leaving users to think that iPhone apps sometimes just don\\'t work. Worse \\nfor Apple, these apps work just fine on other platforms that have immediate approval processes. \\nActually I suppose Apple has a third misconception: that all the complaints about App Store \\napprovals are not a serious problem. They must hear developers complaining. But partners and \\nsuppliers are always complaining. It would be a bad sign if they weren\\'t; it would mean you were \\nbeing too easy on them. Meanwhile the iPhone is selling better than ever. So why do they need \\nto fix anything?\\nThey get away with maltreating developers, in the short term, because they make such great \\nhardware.

But the real problem for Microsoft wasn't the embarrassment of the \\npeople they hired. It was the people they never got. And you know who got them? Google and \\nApple.

Get funded by Y Combinator. \\n October 2009\\n(This essay is derived from a talk at the 2009 Startup School.)\\nI wasn't sure what to talk about at Startup School, so I decided to ask the founders of the \\nstartups we'd funded. What hadn't I written about yet?\\nI'm in the unusual position of being able to test the essays I write about startups. I hope the \\nones on other topics are right, but I have no way to test them. The ones on startups get tested \\nby about 70 people every 6 months.\\nSo I sent all the founders an email asking what surprised them about starting a startup. This \\namounts to asking what I got wrong, because if I'd explained things well enough, nothing \\nshould have surprised them.\\nI'm proud to report I got one response saying: What surprised me the most is that everything \\nwas actually fairly predictable! The bad news is that I got over 100 other responses listing the \\nsurprises they encountered.\\nThere were very clear patterns in th\", \"rised me the most is that everything \\nwas actually fairly predictable! The bad news is that I got over 100 other responses listing the \\nsurprises they encountered.\\nThere were very clear patterns in the responses; it was remarkable how often several people \\nhad been surprised by exactly the same thing. These were the biggest:\\n1. Be Careful with Cofounders\\nThis was the surprise mentioned by the most founders. There were two types of responses: that \\nyou have to be careful who you pick as a cofounder, and that you have to work hard to maintain \\nyour relationship.\\nWhat people wished they'd paid more attention to when choosing cofounders was character \\nand commitment, not ability. This was particularly true with startups that failed. The lesson: don't \\npick cofounders who will flake.\\nHere's a typical reponse: You haven't seen someone's true colors unless you've worked with \\nthem on a startup. The reason character is so important is that it's tested more severely than in \\nmost other situatio\", \"ypical reponse: You haven't seen someone's true colors unless you've worked with \\nthem on a startup. The reason character is so important is that it's tested more severely than in \\nmost other situations. One founder said explicitly that the relationship between founders was \\nmore important than ability: I would rather cofound a startup with a friend than a stranger with \\nhigher output. Startups are so hard and emotional that the bonds and emotional and social \\nsupport that come with friendship outweigh the extra output lost. We learned this lesson a long \\ntime ago. If you look at the YC application, there are more questions about the commitment and \\nrelationship of the founders than their ability.\\nFounders of successful startups talked less about choosing cofounders and more about how \\nhard they worked to maintain their relationship. One thing that surprised me is how the \\nrelationship of startup founders goes from a friendship to a marriage. My relationship with my \\ncofounder went fro\", 'd they worked to maintain their relationship. One thing that surprised me is how the \\nrelationship of startup founders goes from a friendship to a marriage. My relationship with my \\ncofounder went from just being friends to seeing each other all the time, fretting over the \\nfinances and cleaning up shit. And the startup was our baby. I summed it up once like this: \"It\\'s \\nlike we\\'re married, but we\\'re not fucking.\" Several people used that word \"married.\" It\\'s a far \\nmore intense relationship than you usually see between coworkers—partly because the \\nstresses are so much greater, and partly because at first the founders are the whole company. \\nSo this relationship has to be built of top quality materials and carefully maintained. It\\'s the \\nbasis of everything.\\n2. Startups Take Over Your Life\\nJust as the relationship between cofounders is more intense than it usually is between \\ncoworkers, so is the relationship between the founders and the company. Running a startup is \\nnot like having ', \"e\\nJust as the relationship between cofounders is more intense than it usually is between \\ncoworkers, so is the relationship between the founders and the company. Running a startup is \\nnot like having a job or being a student, because it never stops. This is so foreign to most \\npeople's experience that they don't get it till it happens. [1] I didn't realize I would spend almost \\nevery waking moment either working or thinking about our startup. You enter a whole different \\nway of life when it's your company vs. working for someone else's company. It's exacerbated by \\nthe fast pace of startups, which makes it seem like time slows down: I think the thing that's been \\nmost surprising to me is how one's perspective on time shifts. Working on our startup, I \\nremember time seeming to stretch out, so that a month was a huge interval. In the best case, \\ntotal immersion can be exciting: It's surprising how much you become consumed by your \\nstartup, in that you think about it day and night, but ne\", 'so that a month was a huge interval. In the best case, \\ntotal immersion can be exciting: It\\'s surprising how much you become consumed by your \\nstartup, in that you think about it day and night, but never once does it feel like \"work.\" Though I \\nhave to say, that quote is from someone we funded this summer. In a couple years he may not \\nsound so chipper.\\n3. It\\'s an Emotional Roller-coaster\\nThis was another one lots of people were surprised about. The ups and downs were more \\nextreme than they were prepared for.\\nIn a startup, things seem great one moment and hopeless the next. And by next, I mean a \\ncouple hours later. The emotional ups and downs were the biggest surprise for me. One day, \\nwe\\'d think of ourselves as the next Google and dream of buying islands; the next, we\\'d be \\npondering how to let our loved ones know of our utter failure; and on and on. The hard part, \\nobviously, is the lows. For a lot of founders that was the big surprise: How hard it is to keep \\neveryone motivated du', 'w to let our loved ones know of our utter failure; and on and on. The hard part, \\nobviously, is the lows. For a lot of founders that was the big surprise: How hard it is to keep \\neveryone motivated during rough days or weeks, i.e. how low the lows can be. After a while, if \\nyou don\\'t have significant success to cheer you up, it wears you out: Your most basic advice to \\nfounders is \"just don\\'t die,\" but the energy to keep a company going in lieu of unburdening \\nsuccess isn\\'t free; it is siphoned from the founders themselves. There\\'s a limit to how much you \\ncan take. If you get to the point where you can\\'t keep working anymore, it\\'s not the end of the \\nworld. Plenty of famous founders have had some failures along the way.\\n4. It Can Be Fun\\nThe good news is, the highs are also very high. Several founders said what surprised them \\nmost about doing a startup was how fun it was: I think you\\'ve left out just how fun it is to do a \\nstartup. I am more fulfilled in my work than pretty much any o', 'ral founders said what surprised them \\nmost about doing a startup was how fun it was: I think you\\'ve left out just how fun it is to do a \\nstartup. I am more fulfilled in my work than pretty much any of my friends who did not start \\ncompanies. What they like most is the freedom: I\\'m surprised by how much better it feels to be \\nworking on something that is challenging and creative, something I believe in, as opposed to \\nthe hired-gun stuff I was doing before. I knew it would feel better; what\\'s surprising is how much \\nbetter. Frankly, though, if I\\'ve misled people here, I\\'m not eager to fix that. I\\'d rather have \\neveryone think starting a startup is grim and hard than have founders go into it expecting it to \\nbe fun, and a few months later saying \"This is supposed to be fun? Are you kidding?\"\\nThe truth is, it wouldn\\'t be fun for most people. A lot of what we try to do in the application \\nprocess is to weed out the people who wouldn\\'t like it, both for our sake and theirs.\\nThe best way to', '\"\\nThe truth is, it wouldn\\'t be fun for most people. A lot of what we try to do in the application \\nprocess is to weed out the people who wouldn\\'t like it, both for our sake and theirs.\\nThe best way to put it might be that starting a startup is fun the way a survivalist training course \\nwould be fun, if you\\'re into that sort of thing. Which is to say, not at all, if you\\'re not.\\n5. Persistence Is the Key\\nA lot of founders were surprised how important persistence was in startups. It was both a \\nnegative and a positive surprise: they were surprised both by the degree of persistence \\nrequired Everyone said how determined and resilient you must be, but going through it made \\nme realize that the determination required was still understated. and also by the degree to \\nwhich persistence alone was able to dissolve obstacles: If you are persistent, even problems \\nthat seem out of your control (i.e. immigration) seem to work themselves out. Several founders \\nmentioned specifically how much more im', \"ble to dissolve obstacles: If you are persistent, even problems \\nthat seem out of your control (i.e. immigration) seem to work themselves out. Several founders \\nmentioned specifically how much more important persistence was than intelligence. I've been \\nsurprised again and again by just how much more important persistence is than raw \\nintelligence. This applies not just to intelligence but to ability in general, and that's why so many \\npeople said character was more important in choosing cofounders.\\n6. Think Long-Term\\nYou need persistence because everything takes longer than you expect. A lot of people were \\nsurprised by that. I'm continually surprised by how long everything can take. Assuming your \\nproduct doesn't experience the explosive growth that very few products do, everything from \\ndevelopment to dealmaking (especially dealmaking) seems to take 2-3x longer than I always \\nimagine. One reason founders are surprised is that because they work fast, they expect \\neveryone else to. Th\", '\\ndevelopment to dealmaking (especially dealmaking) seems to take 2-3x longer than I always \\nimagine. One reason founders are surprised is that because they work fast, they expect \\neveryone else to. There\\'s a shocking amount of shear stress at every point where a startup \\ntouches a more bureaucratic organization, like a big company or a VC fund. That\\'s why \\nfundraising and the enterprise market kill and maim so many startups. [2]\\nBut I think the reason most founders are surprised by how long it takes is that they\\'re \\noverconfident. They think they\\'re going to be an instant success, like YouTube or Facebook. You \\ntell them only 1 out of 100 successful startups has a trajectory like that, and they all think \"we\\'re \\ngoing to be that 1.\"\\nMaybe they\\'ll listen to one of the more successful founders: The top thing I didn\\'t understand \\nbefore going into it is that persistence is the name of the game. For the vast majority of startups \\nthat become successful, it\\'s going to be a really long journ', \"rs: The top thing I didn't understand \\nbefore going into it is that persistence is the name of the game. For the vast majority of startups \\nthat become successful, it's going to be a really long journey, at least 3 years and probably 5+. \\nThere is a positive side to thinking longer-term. It's not just that you have to resign yourself to \\neverything taking longer than it should. If you work patiently it's less stressful, and you can do \\nbetter work: Because we're relaxed, it's so much easier to have fun doing what we do. Gone is \\nthe awkward nervous energy fueled by the desperate need to not fail guiding our actions. We \\ncan concentrate on doing what's best for our company, product, employees and customers. \\nThat's why things get so much better when you hit ramen profitability. You can shift into a \\ndifferent mode of working.\\n7. Lots of Little Things\\nWe often emphasize how rarely startups win simply because they hit on some magic idea. I \\nthink founders have now gotten that into their h\", \"t into a \\ndifferent mode of working.\\n7. Lots of Little Things\\nWe often emphasize how rarely startups win simply because they hit on some magic idea. I \\nthink founders have now gotten that into their heads. But a lot were surprised to find this also \\napplies within startups. You have to do lots of different things: It's much more of a grind than \\nglamorous. A timeslice selected at random would more likely find me tracking down a weird DLL \\nloading bug on Swedish Windows, or tracking down a bug in the financial model Excel \\nspreadsheet the night before a board meeting, rather than having brilliant flashes of strategic \\ninsight. Most hacker-founders would like to spend all their time programming. You won't get to, \\nunless you fail. Which can be transformed into: If you spend all your time programming, you will \\nfail.\\nThe principle extends even into programming. There is rarely a single brilliant hack that ensures \\nsuccess: I learnt never to bet on any one feature or deal or anything to br\", \"gramming, you will \\nfail.\\nThe principle extends even into programming. There is rarely a single brilliant hack that ensures \\nsuccess: I learnt never to bet on any one feature or deal or anything to bring you success. It is \\nnever a single thing. Everything is just incremental and you just have to keep doing lots of those \\nthings until you strike something. Even in the rare cases where a clever hack makes your \\nfortune, you probably won't know till later: There is no such thing as a killer feature. Or at least \\nyou won't know what it is. So the best strategy is to try lots of different things. The reason not to \\nput all your eggs in one basket is not the usual one, which applies even when you know which \\nbasket is best. In a startup you don't even know that.\\n8. Start with Something Minimal\\nLots of founders mentioned how important it was to launch with the simplest possible thing. By \\nthis point everyone knows you should release fast and iterate. It's practically a mantra at YC. \\nBut eve\", 'Lots of founders mentioned how important it was to launch with the simplest possible thing. By \\nthis point everyone knows you should release fast and iterate. It\\'s practically a mantra at YC. \\nBut even so a lot of people seem to have been burned by not doing it: Build the absolute \\nsmallest thing that can be considered a complete application and ship it. Why do people take \\ntoo long on the first version? Pride, mostly. They hate to release something that could be better. \\nThey worry what people will say about them. But you have to overcome this: Doing something \\n\"simple\" at first glance does not mean you aren\\'t doing something meaningful, defensible, or \\nvaluable. Don\\'t worry what people will say. If your first version is so impressive that trolls don\\'t \\nmake fun of it, you waited too long to launch.

[3]\\nOne founder said this should be your approach to all programming, not just startups, and I tend \\nto agree. Now, when coding, I try to think \"How can I write this such that if people saw my code, \\nthey\\'d be amazed at how little there is and how little it does?\" Over-engineering is poison. It\\'s \\nnot like doing extra work for extra credit. It\\'s more like telling a lie that you then have to \\nremember so you don\\'t contradict it.\\n9. Engage Users\\nProduct development is a conversation with the user that doesn\\'t really start till you launch. \\nBefore you launch, you\\'re like a police artist before he\\'s shown the first version of his sketch to \\nthe witness.\\nIt\\'s so important to launch fast that it may be better to think of your initial version not as a \\nproduct, but as a trick for getting users to start talking to you. I learned to think about the initial \\nstages of a startup as a giant experiment. All products should be considered experiments, and \\nthose that have a market show pr', \"ing users to start talking to you. I learned to think about the initial \\nstages of a startup as a giant experiment. All products should be considered experiments, and \\nthose that have a market show promising results extremely quickly. Once you start talking to \\nusers, I guarantee you'll be surprised by what they tell you. When you let customers tell you \\nwhat they're after, they will often reveal amazing details about what they find valuable as well \\nwhat they're willing to pay for. The surprise is generally positive as well as negative. They won't \\nlike what you've built, but there will be other things they would like that would be trivially easy to \\nimplement. It's not till you start the conversation by launching the wrong thing that they can \\nexpress (or perhaps even realize) what they're looking for.\\n10. Change Your Idea\\nTo benefit from engaging with users you have to be willing to change your idea. We've always \\nencouraged founders to see a startup idea as a hypothesis rather than\", \"re looking for.\\n10. Change Your Idea\\nTo benefit from engaging with users you have to be willing to change your idea. We've always \\nencouraged founders to see a startup idea as a hypothesis rather than a blueprint. And yet \\nthey're still surprised how well it works to change the idea. Normally if you complain about \\nsomething being hard, the general advice is to work harder. With a startup, I think you should \\nfind a problem that's easy for you to solve. Optimizing in solution-space is familiar and \\nstraightforward, but you can make enormous gains playing around in problem-space. Whereas \\nmere determination, without flexibility, is a greedy algorithm that may get you nothing more than \\na mediocre local maximum: When someone is determined, there's still a danger that they'll \\nfollow a long, hard path that ultimately leads nowhere. You want to push forward, but at the \\nsame time twist and turn to find the most promising path. One founder put it very succinctly: \\nFast iteration is the key \", 'hard path that ultimately leads nowhere. You want to push forward, but at the \\nsame time twist and turn to find the most promising path. One founder put it very succinctly: \\nFast iteration is the key to success. One reason this advice is so hard to follow is that people \\ndon\\'t realize how hard it is to judge startup ideas, particularly their own. Experienced founders \\nlearn to keep an open mind: Now I don\\'t laugh at ideas anymore, because I realized how \\nterrible I was at knowing if they were good or not. You can never tell what will work. You just \\nhave to do whatever seems best at each point. We do this with YC itself. We still don\\'t know if it \\nwill work, but it seems like a decent hypothesis.\\n11. Don\\'t Worry about Competitors\\nWhen you think you\\'ve got a great idea, it\\'s sort of like having a guilty conscience about \\nsomething. All someone has to do is look at you funny, and you think \"Oh my God, they know.\"\\nThese alarms are almost always false: Companies that seemed like competitor', 'ving a guilty conscience about \\nsomething. All someone has to do is look at you funny, and you think \"Oh my God, they know.\"\\nThese alarms are almost always false: Companies that seemed like competitors and threats at \\nfirst glance usually never were when you really looked at it. Even if they were operating in the \\nsame area, they had a different goal. One reason people overreact to competitors is that they \\novervalue ideas. If ideas really were the key, a competitor with the same idea would be a real \\nthreat. But it\\'s usually execution that matters: All the scares induced by seeing a new competitor \\npop up are forgotten weeks later. It always comes down to your own product and approach to \\nthe market. This is generally true even if competitors get lots of attention. Competitors riding on \\nlots of good blogger perception aren\\'t really the winners and can disappear from the map \\nquickly. You need consumers after all. Hype doesn\\'t make satisfied users, at least not for \\nsomething as compl', 'lots of good blogger perception aren\\'t really the winners and can disappear from the map \\nquickly. You need consumers after all. Hype doesn\\'t make satisfied users, at least not for \\nsomething as complicated as technology.\\n12. It\\'s Hard to Get Users\\nA lot of founders complained about how hard it was to get users, though. I had no idea how \\nmuch time and effort needed to go into attaining users. This is a complicated topic. When you \\ncan\\'t get users, it\\'s hard to say whether the problem is lack of exposure, or whether the \\nproduct\\'s simply bad. Even good products can be blocked by switching or integration costs: \\nGetting people to use a new service is incredibly difficult. This is especially true for a service \\nthat other companies can use, because it requires their developers to do work. If you\\'re small, \\nthey don\\'t think it is urgent. [4] The sharpest criticism of YC came from a founder who said we \\ndidn\\'t focus enough on customer acquisition: YC preaches \"make something people want\" a', ' you\\'re small, \\nthey don\\'t think it is urgent. [4] The sharpest criticism of YC came from a founder who said we \\ndidn\\'t focus enough on customer acquisition: YC preaches \"make something people want\" as \\nan engineering task, a never ending stream of feature after feature until enough people are \\nhappy and the application takes off. There\\'s very little focus on the cost of customer acquisition. \\nThis may be true; this may be something we need to fix, especially for applications like games. \\nIf you make something where the challenges are mostly technical, you can rely on word of \\nmouth, like Google did. One founder was surprised by how well that worked for him: There is an \\nirrational fear that no one will buy your product. But if you work hard and incrementally make it \\nbetter, there is no need to worry. But with other types of startups you may win less by features \\nand more by deals and marketing.\\n13. Expect the Worst with Deals\\nDeals fall through. That\\'s a constant of the startup world', \"eed to worry. But with other types of startups you may win less by features \\nand more by deals and marketing.\\n13. Expect the Worst with Deals\\nDeals fall through. That's a constant of the startup world. Startups are powerless, and good \\nstartup ideas generally seem wrong. So everyone is nervous about closing deals with you, and \\nyou have no way to make them.\\nThis is particularly true with investors: In retrospect, it would have been much better if we had \\noperated under the assumption that we would never get any additional outside investment. That \\nwould have focused us on finding revenue streams early. My advice is generally pessimistic. \\nAssume you won't get money, and if someone does offer you any, assume you'll never get any \\nmore. If someone offers you money, take it. You say it a lot, but I think it needs even more \\nemphasizing. We had the opportunity to raise a lot more money than we did last year and I wish \\nwe had. Why do founders ignore me? Mostly because they're optimistic by\", \" but I think it needs even more \\nemphasizing. We had the opportunity to raise a lot more money than we did last year and I wish \\nwe had. Why do founders ignore me? Mostly because they're optimistic by nature. The mistake \\nis to be optimistic about things you can't control. By all means be optimistic about your ability to \\nmake something great. But you're asking for trouble if you're optimistic about big companies or \\ninvestors.\\n14. Investors Are Clueless\\nA lot of founders mentioned how surprised they were by the cluelessness of investors: They \\ndon't even know about the stuff they've invested in. I met some investors that had invested in a \\nhardware device and when I asked them to demo the device they had difficulty switching it on. \\nAngels are a bit better than VCs, because they usually have startup experience themselves: VC \\ninvestors don't know half the time what they are talking about and are years behind in their \\nthinking. A few were great, but 95% of the investors we dealt with \", \"ave startup experience themselves: VC \\ninvestors don't know half the time what they are talking about and are years behind in their \\nthinking. A few were great, but 95% of the investors we dealt with were unprofessional, didn't \\nseem to be very good at business or have any kind of creative vision. Angels were generally \\nmuch better to talk to. Why are founders surprised that VCs are clueless? I think it's because \\nthey seem so formidable.\\nThe reason VCs seem formidable is that it's their profession to. You get to be a VC by \\nconvincing asset managers to trust you with hundreds of millions of dollars. How do you do \\nthat? You have to seem confident, and you have to seem like you understand technology. [5]\\n15. You May Have to Play Games\\nBecause investors are so bad at judging you, you have to work harder than you should at \\nselling yourself. One founder said the thing that surprised him most was The degree to which \\nfeigning certitude impressed investors. This is the thing that has surpr\", \"o work harder than you should at \\nselling yourself. One founder said the thing that surprised him most was The degree to which \\nfeigning certitude impressed investors. This is the thing that has surprised me most about YC \\nfounders' experiences. This summer we invited some of the alumni to talk to the new startups \\nabout fundraising, and pretty much 100% of their advice was about investor psychology. I \\nthought I was cynical about VCs, but the founders were much more cynical. A lot of what \\nstartup founders do is just posturing. It works. VCs themselves have no idea of the extent to \\nwhich the startups they like are the ones that are best at selling themselves to VCs. [6] It's \\nexactly the same phenomenon we saw a step earlier. VCs get money by seeming confident to \\nLPs, and founders get money by seeming confident to VCs.\\n16. Luck Is a Big Factor\\nWith two such random linkages in the path between startups and money, it shouldn't be \\nsurprising that luck is a big factor in deals. And yet\", \"oney by seeming confident to VCs.\\n16. Luck Is a Big Factor\\nWith two such random linkages in the path between startups and money, it shouldn't be \\nsurprising that luck is a big factor in deals. And yet a lot of founders are surprised by it. I didn't \\nrealize how much of a role luck plays and how much is outside of our control. If you think about \\nfamous startups, it's pretty clear how big a role luck plays. Where would Microsoft be if IBM \\ninsisted on an exclusive license for DOS?\\nWhy are founders fooled by this? Business guys probably aren't, but hackers are used to a \\nworld where skill is paramount, and you get what you deserve. When we started our startup, I \\nhad bought the hype of the startup founder dream: that this is a game of skill. It is, in some \\nways. Having skill is valuable. So is being determined as all hell. But being lucky is the critical \\ningredient. Actually the best model would be to say that the outcome is the product of skill, \\ndetermination, and luck.

Actually the best model would be to say that the outcome is the product of skill, \\ndetermination, and luck. No matter how much skill and determination you have, if you roll a zero \\nfor luck, the outcome is zero.\\nThese quotes about luck are not from founders whose startups failed. Founders who fail quickly \\ntend to blame themselves. Founders who succeed quickly don't usually realize how lucky they \\nwere. It's the ones in the middle who see how important luck is.\\n17. The Value of Community\\nA surprising number of founders said what surprised them most about starting a startup was \\nthe value of community. Some meant the micro-community of YC founders: The immense value \\nof the peer group of YC companies, and facing similar obstacles at similar times. which \\nshouldn't be that surprising, because that's why it's structured that way. Others were surprised \\nat the value of the startup community in the larger sense: \", \"similar obstacles at similar times. which \\nshouldn't be that surprising, because that's why it's structured that way.

The specific thing that surprised them most was the general spirit \\nof benevolence: One of the most surprising things I saw was the willingness of people to help \\nus. Even people who had nothing to gain went out of their way to help our startup succeed. and \\nparticularly how it extended all the way to the top: The surprise for me was how accessible \\nimportant and interesting people are.

You Get No Respect\\nThere was one surprise founders mentioned that I\\'d forgotten about: that outside the startup \\nworld, startup founders get no respect. In social settings, I found that I got a lot more respect \\nwhen I said, \"I worked on Microsoft Office\" instead of \"I work at a small startup you\\'ve never \\nheard of called x.\" Partly this is because the rest of the world just doesn\\'t get startups, and \\npartly it\\'s yet another consequence of the fact that most good startup ideas seem bad: If you \\npitch your idea to a random person, 95% of the time you\\'ll find the person instinctively thinks the \\nidea will be a flop and you\\'re wasting your time (although they probably won\\'t say this directly). \\nUnfortunately this extends even to dating: It surprised me that being a startup founder does not \\nget you', \"will be a flop and you're wasting your time (although they probably won't say this directly). \\nUnfortunately this extends even to dating: It surprised me that being a startup founder does not \\nget you more admiration from women. I did know about that, but I'd forgotten.\\n19. Things Change as You Grow\\nThe last big surprise founders mentioned is how much things changed as they grew. The \\nbiggest change was that you got to program even less: Your job description as technical founder/\\nCEO is completely rewritten every 6-12 months. Less coding, more managing/planning/\\ncompany building, hiring, cleaning up messes, and generally getting things in place for what \\nneeds to happen a few months from now. In particular, you now have to deal with employees, \\nwho often have different motivations: I knew the founder equation and had been focused on it \\nsince I knew I wanted to start a startup as a 19 year old. The employee equation is quite \\ndifferent so it took me a while to get it down. Fortunately,\", \"the founder equation and had been focused on it \\nsince I knew I wanted to start a startup as a 19 year old. The employee equation is quite \\ndifferent so it took me a while to get it down. Fortunately, it can become a lot less stressful once \\nyou reach cruising altitude: I'd say 75% of the stress is gone now from when we first started. \\nRunning a business is so much more enjoyable now. We're more confident. We're more patient. \\nWe fight less. We sleep more. I wish I could say it was this way for every startup that \\nsucceeded, but 75% is probably on the high side.\\nThe Super-Pattern\\nThere were a few other patterns, but these were the biggest. One's first thought when looking at \\nthem all is to ask if there's a super-pattern, a pattern to the patterns.\\nI saw it immediately, and so did a YC founder I read the list to. These are supposed to be the \\nsurprises, the things I didn't tell people. What do they all have in common? They're all things I \\ntell people. If I wrote a new essay with the s\", \"nder I read the list to. These are supposed to be the \\nsurprises, the things I didn't tell people. What do they all have in common? They're all things I \\ntell people. If I wrote a new essay with the same outline as this that wasn't summarizing the \\nfounders' responses, everyone would say I'd run out of ideas and was just repeating myself.\\nWhat is going on here?\\nWhen I look at the responses, the common theme is that starting a startup was like I said, but \\nway more so. People just don't seem to get how different it is till they do it. Why? The key to that \\nmystery is to ask, how different from what? Once you phrase it that way, the answer is obvious: \\nfrom a job. Everyone's model of work is a job. It's completely pervasive. Even if you've never \\nhad a job, your parents probably did, along with practically every other adult you've met.\\nUnconsciously, everyone expects a startup to be like a job, and that explains most of the \\nsurprises. It explains why people are surprised how carefully y\", 'ith practically every other adult you\\'ve met.\\nUnconsciously, everyone expects a startup to be like a job, and that explains most of the \\nsurprises. It explains why people are surprised how carefully you have to choose cofounders \\nand how hard you have to work to maintain your relationship. You don\\'t have to do that with \\ncoworkers. It explains why the ups and downs are surprisingly extreme. In a job there is much \\nmore damping. But it also explains why the good times are surprisingly good: most people can\\'t \\nimagine such freedom. As you go down the list, almost all the surprises are surprising in how \\nmuch a startup differs from a job.\\nYou probably can\\'t overcome anything so pervasive as the model of work you grew up with. So \\nthe best solution is to be consciously aware of that. As you go into a startup, you\\'ll be thinking \\n\"everyone says it\\'s really extreme.\" Your next thought will probably be \"but I can\\'t believe it will \\nbe that bad.\" If you want to avoid being surprised, the next ', ' into a startup, you\\'ll be thinking \\n\"everyone says it\\'s really extreme.\" Your next thought will probably be \"but I can\\'t believe it will \\nbe that bad.\" If you want to avoid being surprised, the next thought after that should be: \"and \\nthe reason I can\\'t believe it will be that bad is that my model of work is a job.\"\\nNotes:\\n[1] Graduate students might understand it.

The ', \"nizers have a problem to explain: why are unions shrinking now? The best \\nthey can do is fall back on the default explanation of people living in fallen civilizations. Our \\nancestors were giants. The workers of the early twentieth century must have had a moral \\ncourage that's lacking today. Now here's the same paragraph rewritten to please instead of \\noffending them: Early union organizers made heroic sacrifices to improve conditions for \\nworkers. But though labor unions are shrinking now, it's not because present union leaders are \\nany less courageous. An employer couldn't get away with hiring thugs to beat up union leaders \\ntoday, but if they did, I see no reason to believe today's union leaders would shrink from the \\nchallenge. So I think it would be a mistake to attribute the decline of unions to some kind of \\ndecline in the people who run them. Early union leaders were heroic, certainly, but we should \\nnot suppose that if unions have declined, it's because present union leaders ar\", 'f unions to some kind of \\ndecline in the people who run them. Early union leaders were heroic, certainly, but we should \\nnot suppose that if unions have declined, it\\'s because present union leaders are somehow \\ninferior. The cause must be external.

That makes it more persuasive to people who like unions, because it \\nseems sympathetic to their cause.\\nI believe everything I wrote in the second version. Early union leaders did make heroic \\nsacrifices. And present union leaders probably would rise to the occasion if necessary.

Why offend \\npeople needlessly?\\nBecause I\\'d rather offend people than pander to them, and if you write about controversial \\ntopics you have to choose one or the other. The degree of courage of past or present union \\nleaders is beside the point; all that matters for the argument is that they\\'re the same.

At least, that's how they see it.\\nIn fact consumers never really were paying for content, and publishers weren't really selling it \\neither. If the content was what they were selling, why has the price of books or music or movies \\nalways depended mostly on the format? Why didn't better content cost more?

We can all imagine an \\nold-style editor getting a scoop and saying \"this will sell a lot of papers!\" Cross out that final S \\nand you\\'re describing their business model. The reason they make less money now is that \\npeople don\\'t need as much paper.\\nA few months ago I ran into a friend in a cafe.

But this time something new happened. I felt that sheepish feeling \\nyou get when you offer someone something worthless. \"Do you, er, want a printout of \\nyesterday\\'s news?\" I asked. (He didn\\'t.)\\nNow that the medium is evaporating, publishers have nothing left to sell. Some seem to think \\nthey\\'re going to sell content—that they were always in the content business, really. But they \\nweren\\'t, and it\\'s unclear whether anyone could be.\\nSelling\\nThere have always been people in the business of selling information, but that has historically \\nbeen a distinct business from publishing.

That's why they paid for \\nthose stock tip newsletters, and why companies pay now for Bloomberg terminals and \\nEconomist Intelligence Unit reports. But will people pay for information otherwise? History offers \\nlittle encouragement.\\nIf audiences were willing to pay more for better content, why wasn't anyone already selling it to \\nthem?

Well, not really. iTunes is \\nmore of a tollbooth than a store. Apple controls the default path onto the iPod. They offer a \\nconvenient list of songs, and whenever you choose one they ding your credit card for a small \\namount, just below the threshold of attention. Basically, iTunes makes money by taxing people, \\nnot selling them stuff. You can only do that if you own the channel, and even then you don't \\nmake much from it, because a toll has to be ignorable to work. Once a toll becomes painful, \\npeople start to find ways around it, and that's pretty easy with digital content.\\nThe situation is much the same with digital books.

Getting a book printed and distributed is a daunting prospect for a \\nwriter, but most can upload a file.\\nIs software a counterexample? People pay a lot for desktop software, and that's just \\ninformation. True, but I don't think publishers can learn much from software. Software \\ncompanies can charge a lot because (a) many of the customers are businesses, who get in \\ntrouble if they use pirated versions, and (b) though in form merely information, software is \\ntreated by both maker and purchaser as a different type of thing from a song or an article.

A \\nPhotoshop user needs Photoshop in a way that no one needs a particular song or article.\\nThat\\'s why there\\'s a separate word, \"content,\" for information that\\'s not software. Software is a \\ndifferent business. Software and content blur together in some of the most lightweight software, \\nlike casual games. But those are usually free. To make money the way software companies do, \\npublishers would have to become software companies, and being publishers gives them no \\nparticular head start in that domain. [2]\\nThe most promising countertrend is the premium cable channel. People still pay for those. But \\nbroadcasting isn\\'t publishing: you\\'re not selling a copy of something.

But there are limits to how well they'll be able to do that. Once publishing—giving \\npeople copies—becomes the most natural way of distributing your content, it probably doesn't \\nwork to stick to old forms of distribution just because you make more that way. If free copies of \\nyour content are available online, then you're competing with publishing's form of distribution, \\nand that's just as bad as being a publisher.\\nApparently some people in the music business hope to retroactively convert it away from \\npublishing, by getting listeners to pay for subscriptions.

Give music away and make money from \\nconcerts and t-shirts. Publish articles for free and make money from one of a dozen \\npermutations of advertising. Both publishers and investors are down on advertising at the \\nmoment, but it has more potential than they realize.\\nI'm not claiming that potential will be realized by the existing players.

If I have to give a talk and I haven't started it a few days beforehand, I'll \\nsometimes play it safe and make the talk a list of n things.\\nThe list of n things is easier for writers as well as readers. When you're writing a real essay, \\nthere's always a chance you'll hit a dead end. A real essay is a train of thought, and some trains \\nof thought just peter out. That's an alarming possibility when you have to give a talk in a few \\ndays. What if you run out of ideas?

So bang, \\nthere's the structure, and you just have to fill it in. As you think of more points, you just add them \\nto the end. Maybe you take out or rearrange or combine a few, but at every stage you have a \\nvalid (though initially low-res) list of n things. It's like the sort of programming where you write a \\nversion 1 very quickly and then gradually modify it, but at every point have working code—or \\nthe style of painting where you begin with a complete but very blurry sketch done in an hour, \\nthen spend a week cranking up the resolution.\\nBecause the list of n things is easier for writers\", \"code—or \\nthe style of painting where you begin with a complete but very blurry sketch done in an hour, \\nthen spend a week cranking up the resolution.\\nBecause the list of n things is easier for writers too, it's not always a damning sign when \\nreaders prefer it.

Get funded by Y Combinator. \\n September 2009\\nLike all investors, we spend a lot of time trying to learn how to predict which startups will \\nsucceed. We probably spend more time thinking about it than most, because we invest the \\nearliest. Prediction is usually all we have to rely on.\\nWe learned quickly that the most important predictor of success is determination. At first we \\nthought it might be intelligence. Everyone likes to believe that\\'s what makes startups succeed. It \\nmakes a better story that a company won because its founders were so smart. The PR people \\nand reporters who spread such stories probably believe them thems', \"eve that's what makes startups succeed. It \\nmakes a better story that a company won because its founders were so smart. The PR people \\nand reporters who spread such stories probably believe them themselves. But while it certainly \\nhelps to be smart, it's not the deciding factor. There are plenty of people as smart as Bill Gates \\nwho achieve nothing.\\nIn most domains, talent is overrated compared to determination—partly because it makes a \\nbetter story, partly because it gives onlookers an excuse for being lazy, and partly because after \\na while determination starts to look like talent.\\nI can't think of any field in which determination is overrated, but the relative importance of \\ndetermination and talent probably do vary somewhat. Talent probably matters more in types of \\nwork that are purer, in the sense that one is solving mostly a single type of problem instead of \\nmany different types. I suspect determination would not take you as far in math as it would in, \\nsay, organized crime.\\nI\", \"r, in the sense that one is solving mostly a single type of problem instead of \\nmany different types. I suspect determination would not take you as far in math as it would in, \\nsay, organized crime.\\nI don't mean to suggest by this comparison that types of work that depend more on talent are \\nalways more admirable. Most people would agree it's more admirable to be good at math than \\nmemorizing long strings of digits, even though the latter depends more on natural ability.\\nPerhaps one reason people believe startup founders win by being smarter is that intelligence \\ndoes matter more in technology startups than it used to in earlier types of companies. You \\nprobably do need to be a bit smarter to dominate Internet search than you had to be to \\ndominate railroads or hotels or newspapers. And that's probably an ongoing trend. But even in \\nthe highest of high tech industries, success still depends more on determination than brains.\\nIf determination is so important, can we isolate its componen\", \"at's probably an ongoing trend. But even in \\nthe highest of high tech industries, success still depends more on determination than brains.\\nIf determination is so important, can we isolate its components? Are some more important than \\nothers? Are there some you can cultivate?\\nThe simplest form of determination is sheer willfulness. When you want something, you must \\nhave it, no matter what.\\nA good deal of willfulness must be inborn, because it's common to see families where one \\nsibling has much more of it than another. Circumstances can alter it, but at the high end of the \\nscale, nature seems to be more important than nurture. Bad circumstances can break the spirit \\nof a strong-willed person, but I don't think there's much you can do to make a weak-willed \\nperson stronger-willed.\\nBeing strong-willed is not enough, however. You also have to be hard on yourself. Someone \\nwho was strong-willed but self-indulgent would not be called determined. Determination implies \\nyour willfulness is b\", \"rong-willed is not enough, however. You also have to be hard on yourself. Someone \\nwho was strong-willed but self-indulgent would not be called determined. Determination implies \\nyour willfulness is balanced by discipline.\\nThat word balance is a significant one. The more willful you are, the more disciplined you have \\nto be. The stronger your will, the less anyone will be able to argue with you except yourself. And \\nsomeone has to argue with you, because everyone has base impulses, and if you have more \\nwill than discipline you'll just give into them and end up on a local maximum like drug addiction.\\nWe can imagine will and discipline as two fingers squeezing a slippery melon seed. The harder \\nthey squeeze, the further the seed flies, but they must both squeeze equally or the seed spins \\noff sideways.\\nIf this is true it has interesting implications, because discipline can be cultivated, and in fact \\ndoes tend to vary quite a lot in the course of an individual's life. If determination i\", \"ff sideways.\\nIf this is true it has interesting implications, because discipline can be cultivated, and in fact \\ndoes tend to vary quite a lot in the course of an individual's life. If determination is effectively the \\nproduct of will and discipline, then you can become more determined by being more disciplined. \\n[1]\\nAnother consequence of the melon seed model is that the more willful you are, the more \\ndangerous it is to be undisciplined. There seem to be plenty of examples to confirm that. In \\nsome very energetic people's lives you see something like wing flutter, where they alternate \\nbetween doing great work and doing absolutely nothing. Externally this would look a lot like \\nbipolar disorder.\\nThe melon seed model is inaccurate in at least one respect, however: it's static. In fact the \\ndangers of indiscipline increase with temptation. Which means, interestingly, that determination \\ntends to erode itself. If you're sufficiently determined to achieve great things, this will probably\", \" \\ndangers of indiscipline increase with temptation. Which means, interestingly, that determination \\ntends to erode itself. If you're sufficiently determined to achieve great things, this will probably \\nincrease the number of temptations around you. Unless you become proportionally more \\ndisciplined, willfulness will then get the upper hand, and your achievement will revert to the \\nmean.\\nThat's why Shakespeare's Caesar thought thin men so dangerous. They weren't tempted by the \\nminor perquisites of power.\\nThe melon seed model implies it's possible to be too disciplined. Is it? I think there probably are \\npeople whose willfulness is crushed down by excessive discipline, and who would achieve more \\nif they weren't so hard on themselves. One reason the young sometimes succeed where the old \\nfail is that they don't realize how incompetent they are. This lets them do a kind of deficit \\nspending. When they first start working on something, they overrate their achievements. But \\nthat gives the\", \"il is that they don't realize how incompetent they are.

But \\nthat gives them confidence to keep working, and their performance improves. Whereas \\nsomeone clearer-eyed would see their initial incompetence for what it was, and perhaps be \\ndiscouraged from continuing.\\nThere's one other major component of determination: ambition. If willfulness and discipline are \\nwhat get you to your destination, ambition is how you choose it.\\nI don't know if it's exactly right to say that ambition is a component of determination, but they're \\nnot entirely orthogonal. It would seem a misnomer if someone said they were very determined \\nto do something trivially easy.\\nAnd fortunately ambition seems to be quite malleable; there's a lot you can do to increase it. \\nMost people don't know how ambitious to be, especially when they're young.

And this problem is exacerbated by having few peers. \\nAmbitious people are rare, so if everyone is mixed together randomly, as they tend to be early \\nin people's lives, then the ambitious ones won't have many ambitious peers. When you take \\npeople like this and put them together with other ambitious people, they bloom like dying plants \\ngiven water. Probably most ambitious people are starved for the sort of encouragement they'd \\nget from ambitious peers, whatever their age. [2]\\nAchievements also tend to increase your ambition. With each step you gain confidence to \\nstretch further next time.\\nSo here in sum is how determination seems to work: it consists of willfulness balanced with \\ndiscipline, aimed by ambition.

And fortunately at least two of these three qualities can be \\ncultivated. You may be able to increase your strength of will somewhat; you can definitely learn \\nself-discipline; and almost everyone is practically malnourished when it comes to ambition.\\nI feel like I understand determination a bit better now. But only a bit: willfulness, discipline, and \\nambition are all concepts almost as complicated as determination. [3]\\nNote too that determination and talent are not the whole story. There's a third factor in \\nachievement: how much you like the work. If you really love working on something, you don't \\nneed determination to drive you; it's what you'd do anyway.

What I'm claiming with the melon seed model is more like determination is proportionate to \\nwd^m - k|w - d|^n, where w is will and d discipline.\\n[2] Which means one of the best ways to help a society generally is to create events and institutions that bring \\nambitious people together.

The first alone yields \\nsomeone who's stubbornly inert. The second alone yields someone flighty. As willful people get older or otherwise \\nlose their energy, they tend to become merely stubborn.\\nThanks to Sam Altman, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.\\nWhat Kate Saw in Silicon Valley   - # 117\\nAugust 2009\\nKate Courteau is the architect who designed Y Combinator's office.

Though she'd \\nheard a lot about YC since the beginning, the last 9 months have been a total immersion.\\nI've been around the startup world for so long that it seems normal to me, so I was curious to \\nhear what had surprised her most about it. This was her list:\\n1. How many startups fail.\\nKate knew in principle that startups were very risky, but she was surprised to see how constant \\nthe threat of failure was — not just for the minnows, but even for the famous startups whose \\nfounders came to speak at YC dinners.\\n2. How much startups' ideas change.\\nAs usual, by Demo Day about half the startups were doing something significantly different than \\nthey started with. We encourage that. Starting a startup is like science in that you have to follow \\nthe truth wherever it leads. In the rest of the world, people don't start things till they're sure what \\nthey want to do, and once started they tend to continue on their initial p\", \" you have to follow \\nthe truth wherever it leads. In the rest of the world, people don't start things till they're sure what \\nthey want to do, and once started they tend to continue on their initial path even if it's mistaken.\\n3. How little money it can take to start a startup.\\nIn Kate's world, everything is still physical and expensive. You can barely renovate a bathroom \\nfor the cost of starting a startup.\\n4. How scrappy founders are.\\nThat was her actual word. I agree with her, but till she mentioned this it never occurred to me \\nhow little this quality is appreciated in most of the rest of the world. It wouldn't be a compliment \\nin most organizations to call someone scrappy.\\nWhat does it mean, exactly? It's basically the diminutive form of belligerent. Someone who's \\nscrappy manages to be both threatening and undignified at the same time. Which seems to me \\nexactly what one would want to be, in any kind of work. If you're not threatening, you're probably \\nnot doing anything new, and\", 'be both threatening and undignified at the same time. Which seems to me \\nexactly what one would want to be, in any kind of work. If you\\'re not threatening, you\\'re probably \\nnot doing anything new, and dignity is merely a sort of plaque.\\n5. How tech-saturated Silicon Valley is.\\n\"It seems like everybody here is in the industry.\" That isn\\'t literally true, but there is a qualitative \\ndifference between Silicon Valley and other places. You tend to keep your voice down, because \\nthere\\'s a good chance the person at the next table would know some of the people you\\'re \\ntalking about. I never felt that in Boston. The good news is, there\\'s also a good chance the \\nperson at the next table could help you in some way.\\n6.

I always worry the speakers will put us in an embarrassing \\nposition by contradicting what we tell the startups, but it happens surprisingly rarely.\\nWhen I asked her what specific things she remembered speakers always saying, she \\nmentioned: that the way to succeed was to launch something fast, listen to users, and then \\niterate; that startups required resilience because they were always an emotional rollercoaster; \\nand that most VCs were sheep.\\nI\\'ve been impressed by how consistently the speakers advocate launching fast and iterating. \\nThat was contrarian advice 10 years ago, but it\\'s clearly now the established practice.\\n7. How casual successful startup founders are.\\nMost of the famous founders in Silicon Valley are people you\\'d overlook on the street. It\\'s not \\nmerely that they don\\'t dress up. They don\\'t project any kind of aura of power either. \"They\\'re not \\ntrying to impress anyone.\"\\nInterestingly, while Kate said that she could never pick out successful founders, she c', 'ey don\\'t dress up. They don\\'t project any kind of aura of power either. \"They\\'re not \\ntrying to impress anyone.\"\\nInterestingly, while Kate said that she could never pick out successful founders, she could \\nrecognize VCs, both by the way they dressed and the way they carried themselves.\\n8. How important it is for founders to have people to ask for advice.\\n(I swear I didn\\'t prompt this one.) Without advice \"they\\'d just be sort of lost.\" Fortunately, there \\nare a lot of people to help them. There\\'s a strong tradition within YC of helping other YC-funded \\nstartups. But we didn\\'t invent that idea: it\\'s just a slightly more concentrated form of existing \\nValley culture.\\n9. What a solitary task startups are.\\nArchitects are constantly interacting face to face with other people, whereas doing a technology \\nstartup, at least, tends to require long stretches of uninterrupted time to work. \"You could do it in \\na box.\"\\nBy inverting this list, we can get a portrait of the \"normal\" world.

So startup culture may not merely be \\ndifferent in the way you\\'d expect any subculture to be, but a leading indicator.\\nThe Trouble with the Segway - # 116\\nJuly 2009\\nThe Segway hasn\\'t delivered on its initial promise, to put it mildly.

Get funded by Y Combinator. \\n July 2009\\nNow that the term \"ramen profitable\" has become widespread, I ought to explain precisely what \\nthe idea entails.\\nRamen profitable means a startup makes just enough to pay the founders\\' living expenses. This \\nis a different form of profitability than startups have traditionally aimed for. Traditional profitability \\nmeans a big bet is finally paying off, whereas the main importance of ramen profitability is that it \\nbuys you time. [1]\\nIn the past, a startup would usually become profitable only af', \"l profitability \\nmeans a big bet is finally paying off, whereas the main importance of ramen profitability is that it \\nbuys you time. [1]\\nIn the past, a startup would usually become profitable only after raising and spending quite a lot \\nof money. A company making computer hardware might not become profitable for 5 years, \\nduring which they spent $50 million. But when they did they might have revenues of $50 million \\na year. This kind of profitability means the startup has succeeded.\\nRamen profitability is the other extreme: a startup that becomes profitable after 2 months, even \\nthough its revenues are only $3000 a month, because the only employees are a couple 25 year \\nold founders who can live on practically nothing. Revenues of $3000 a month do not mean the \\ncompany has succeeded. But it does share something with the one that's profitable in the \\ntraditional way: they don't need to raise money to survive.\\nRamen profitability is an unfamiliar idea to most people because it only rece\", \"it does share something with the one that's profitable in the \\ntraditional way: they don't need to raise money to survive.\\nRamen profitability is an unfamiliar idea to most people because it only recently became \\nfeasible. It's still not feasible for a lot of startups; it would not be for most biotech startups, for \\nexample; but it is for many software startups because they're now so cheap. For many, the only \\nreal cost is the founders' living expenses.\\nThe main significance of this type of profitability is that you're no longer at the mercy of \\ninvestors. If you're still losing money, then eventually you'll either have to raise more or shut \\ndown. Once you're ramen profitable this painful choice goes away. You can still raise money, but \\nyou don't have to do it now.\\n* * *\\nThe most obvious advantage of not needing money is that you can get better terms. If investors \\nknow you need money, they'll sometimes take advantage of you. Some may even deliberately \\nstall, because they know that \", \" advantage of not needing money is that you can get better terms. If investors \\nknow you need money, they'll sometimes take advantage of you. Some may even deliberately \\nstall, because they know that as you run out of money you'll become increasingly pliable.\\nBut there are also three less obvious advantages of ramen profitability. One is that it makes you \\nmore attractive to investors. If you're already profitable, on however small a scale, it shows that \\n(a) you can get at least someone to pay you, (b) you're serious about building things people \\nwant, and (c) you're disciplined enough to keep expenses low.\\nThis is reassuring to investors, because you've addressed three of their biggest worries. It's \\ncommon for them to fund companies that have smart founders and a big market, and yet still \\nfail. When these companies fail, it's usually because (a) people wouldn't pay for what they \\nmade, e.g. because it was too hard to sell to them, or the market wasn't ready yet, (b) the \\nfounders s\", \"ll \\nfail.

A company tends to feel \\nrather theoretical when you first start it. It's legally a company, but you feel like you're lying when \\nyou call it one. When people start to pay you significant amounts, the company starts to feel \\nreal. And your own living expenses are the milestone you feel most, because at that point the \\nfuture flips state.

Startups are still very rare. Why don't more people do it? The \\nfinancial risk? Plenty of 25 year olds save nothing anyway. The long hours? Plenty of people \\nwork just as long hours in regular jobs. What keeps people from starting startups is the fear of \\nhaving so much responsibility.

I'm not sure of this, but there seems a decent chance it's true. People are \\ndramatically more productive as founders or early employees of startups—imagine how much \\nless Larry and Sergey would have achieved if they'd gone to work for a big company—and that \\nscale of improvement can change social customs.\\nThe second idea is that startups are a type of business that flourishes in certain places that \\nspecialize in it—that Silicon Valley specializes in startups in the same way Los Angeles \\nspecializes in movies, or New York in finance.

If startups end up being like \\nthe movie business, with just a handful of centers and one dominant one, that's going to have \\nnovel consequences.\\nThere are already signs that startups may not spread particularly well. The spread of startups \\nseems to be proceeding slower than the spread of the Industrial Revolution, despite the fact \\nthat communication is so much faster now.\\nWithin a few decades of the founding of Boulton & Watt there were steam engines scattered \\nover northern Europe and North America.

An individual mine or factory owner could decide to install a steam \\nengine, and within a few years he could probably find someone local to make him one. So \\nsteam engines spread fast. And they spread widely, because the locations of mines and \\nfactories were determined by features like rivers, harbors, and sources of raw materials. [2]\\nStartups don't seem to spread so well, partly because they're more a social than a technical \\nphenomenon, and partly because they're not tied to geography. An individual European \\nmanufacturer could import industrial techniques and they'd work fine.

An individual European \\nmanufacturer could import industrial techniques and they'd work fine.

Once railroads or electric power \\ngrids were invented, every region had to have them. An area without railroads or power was a \\nrich potential market. But this isn't true with startups. There's no need for a Microsoft of France \\nor Google of Germany.\\nGovernments may decide they want to encourage startups locally, but government policy can't \\ncall them into being the way a genuine need could.\\nHow will this all play out?

And such random factors will \\nincreasingly be outweighed by the pull of existing startup hubs.\\nSilicon Valley is where it is because William Shockley wanted to move back to Palo Alto, where \\nhe grew up, and the experts he lured west to work with him liked it so much they stayed. Seattle \\nowes much of its position as a tech center to the same cause: Gates and Allen wanted to move \\nhome. Otherwise Albuquerque might have Seattle's place in the rankings.

If you wanted to create a startup hub by reproducing the way existing ones happened, \\nthe way to do it would be to establish a first-rate research university in a place so nice that rich \\npeople wanted to live there. Then the town would be hospitable to both groups you need: both \\nfounders and investors. That's the combination that yielded Silicon Valley.

Once you had enough good \\nstartups in one place, it would create a self-sustaining chain reaction. Founders would start to \\nmove there without being paid, because that was where their peers were, and investors would \\nappear too, because that was where the deals were.\\nIn practice I doubt any government would have the balls to try this, or the brains to do it right.

Get funded by Y Combinator. \\n March 2009\\nA couple days ago I finally got being a good startup founder down to two words: relentlessly \\nresourceful.\\nTill then the best I'd managed was to get the opposite quality down to one: hapless. Most \\ndictionaries say hapless means unlucky. But the dictionaries are not doing a very good job. A \\nteam that outplays its opponents but loses because of a bad decision by the referee could be \\ncalled unlucky, but not hapless. Hapless implies passivity. To be hapless is to be battered by \\ncircumstances—to let the world have its way with you, instead of having your way with the \\nworld. [1]\\nUnfortunately there's no antony\", 'ss. Hapless implies passivity. To be hapless is to be battered by \\ncircumstances—to let the world have its way with you, instead of having your way with the \\nworld. [1]\\nUnfortunately there\\'s no antonym of hapless, which makes it difficult to tell founders what to aim \\nfor. \"Don\\'t be hapless\" is not much of rallying cry.\\nIt\\'s not hard to express the quality we\\'re looking for in metaphors. The best is probably a \\nrunning back. A good running back is not merely determined, but flexible as well. They want to \\nget downfield, but they adapt their plans on the fly.\\nUnfortunately this is just a metaphor, and not a useful one to most people outside the US. \"Be \\nlike a running back\" is no better than \"Don\\'t be hapless.\"\\nBut finally I\\'ve figured out how to express this quality directly. I was writing a talk for investors, \\nand I had to explain what to look for in founders. What would someone who was the opposite of \\nhapless be like? They\\'d be relentlessly resourceful. Not merely relentless. That\\'', \" a talk for investors, \\nand I had to explain what to look for in founders. What would someone who was the opposite of \\nhapless be like? They'd be relentlessly resourceful. Not merely relentless. That's not enough to \\nmake things go your way except in a few mostly uninteresting domains. In any interesting \\ndomain, the difficulties will be novel. Which means you can't simply plow through them, \\nbecause you don't know initially how hard they are; you don't know whether you're about to \\nplow through a block of foam or granite. So you have to be resourceful. You have to keep trying \\nnew things.\\nBe relentlessly resourceful.\\nThat sounds right, but is it simply a description of how to be successful in general? I don't think \\nso. This isn't the recipe for success in writing or painting, for example. In that kind of work the \\nrecipe is more to be actively curious. Resourceful implies the obstacles are external, which they \\ngenerally are in startups. But in writing and painting they're mostly int\", '. In that kind of work the \\nrecipe is more to be actively curious. Resourceful implies the obstacles are external, which they \\ngenerally are in startups. But in writing and painting they\\'re mostly internal; the obstacle is your \\nown obtuseness. [2]\\nThere probably are other fields where \"relentlessly resourceful\" is the recipe for success. But \\nthough other fields may share it, I think this is the best short description we\\'ll find of what makes \\na good startup founder. I doubt it could be made more precise.\\nNow that we know what we\\'re looking for, that leads to other questions. For example, can this \\nquality be taught? After four years of trying to teach it to people, I\\'d say that yes, surprisingly \\noften it can. Not to everyone, but to many people. [3] Some people are just constitutionally \\npassive, but others have a latent ability to be relentlessly resourceful that only needs to be \\nbrought out.\\nThis is particularly true of young people who have till now always been under the thumb o', \" \\npassive, but others have a latent ability to be relentlessly resourceful that only needs to be \\nbrought out.\\nThis is particularly true of young people who have till now always been under the thumb of \\nsome kind of authority. Being relentlessly resourceful is definitely not the recipe for success in \\nbig companies, or in most schools. I don't even want to think what the recipe is in big \\ncompanies, but it is certainly longer and messier, involving some combination of \\nresourcefulness, obedience, and building alliances.\\nIdentifying this quality also brings us closer to answering a question people often wonder about: \\nhow many startups there could be. There is not, as some people seem to think, any economic \\nupper bound on this number. There's no reason to believe there is any limit on the amount of \\nnewly created wealth consumers can absorb, any more than there is a limit on the number of \\ntheorems that can be proven. So probably the limiting factor on the number of startups is the \\npo\", 'amount of \\nnewly created wealth consumers can absorb, any more than there is a limit on the number of \\ntheorems that can be proven. So probably the limiting factor on the number of startups is the \\npool of potential founders. Some people would make good founders, and others wouldn\\'t. And \\nnow that we can say what makes a good founder, we know how to put an upper bound on the \\nsize of the pool.\\nThis test is also useful to individuals. If you want to know whether you\\'re the right sort of person \\nto start a startup, ask yourself whether you\\'re relentlessly resourceful. And if you want to know \\nwhether to recruit someone as a cofounder, ask if they are.\\nYou can even use it tactically. If I were running a startup, this would be the phrase I\\'d tape to the \\nmirror. \"Make something people want\" is the destination, but \"Be relentlessly resourceful\" is how \\nyou get there.\\nNotes:\\n[1] I think the reason the dictionaries are wrong is that the meaning of the word has shifted. No one writing a \\ndicti', ' the destination, but \"Be relentlessly resourceful\" is how \\nyou get there.\\nNotes:\\n[1] I think the reason the dictionaries are wrong is that the meaning of the word has shifted. No one writing a \\ndictionary from scratch today would say that hapless meant unlucky. But a couple hundred years ago they might \\nhave. People were more at the mercy of circumstances in the past, and as a result a lot of the words we use for good \\nand bad outcomes have origins in words about luck.\\nWhen I was living in Italy, I was once trying to tell someone that I hadn\\'t had much success in doing something, but I \\ncouldn\\'t think of the Italian word for success. I spent some time trying to describe the word I meant. Finally she said \\n\"Ah! Fortuna!\"\\n[2] There are aspects of startups where the recipe is to be actively curious.

Seven years \\nlater I still hadn't started. I put it off because it seemed mysterious and complicated. It turns out \\nto be easier than I expected, and also more interesting.\\nThe part I thought was hard, the mechanics of investing, really isn't. You give a startup money \\nand they give you stock. You'll probably get either preferred stock, which means stock with extra \\nrights like getting y\", 't was hard, the mechanics of investing, really isn\\'t. You give a startup money \\nand they give you stock. You\\'ll probably get either preferred stock, which means stock with extra \\nrights like getting your money back first in a sale, or convertible debt, which means (on paper) \\nyou\\'re lending the company money, and the debt converts to stock at the next sufficiently big \\nfunding round. [1]\\nThere are sometimes minor tactical advantages to using one or the other. The paperwork for \\nconvertible debt is simpler. But really it doesn\\'t matter much which you use. Don\\'t spend much \\ntime worrying about the details of deal terms, especially when you first start angel investing. \\nThat\\'s not how you win at this game. When you hear people talking about a successful angel \\ninvestor, they\\'re not saying \"He got a 4x liquidation preference.\" They\\'re saying \"He invested in \\nGoogle.\"\\nThat\\'s how you win: by investing in the right startups. That is so much more important than \\nanything else that I worry I\\'m ', ' got a 4x liquidation preference.\" They\\'re saying \"He invested in \\nGoogle.\"\\nThat\\'s how you win: by investing in the right startups. That is so much more important than \\nanything else that I worry I\\'m misleading you by even talking about other things.\\nMechanics\\nAngel investors often syndicate deals, which means they join together to invest on the same \\nterms. In a syndicate there is usually a \"lead\" investor who negotiates the terms with the \\nstartup. But not always: sometimes the startup cobbles together a syndicate of investors who \\napproach them independently, and the startup\\'s lawyer supplies the paperwork.\\nThe easiest way to get started in angel investing is to find a friend who already does it, and try \\nto get included in his syndicates. Then all you have to do is write checks.\\nDon\\'t feel like you have to join a syndicate, though. It\\'s not that hard to do it yourself. You can \\njust use the standard series AA documents Wilson Sonsini and Y Combinator published online. \\nYou should o', \"feel like you have to join a syndicate, though. It's not that hard to do it yourself. You can \\njust use the standard series AA documents Wilson Sonsini and Y Combinator published online. \\nYou should of course have your lawyer review everything. Both you and the startup should have \\nlawyers. But the lawyers don't have to create the agreement from scratch. [2]\\nWhen you negotiate terms with a startup, there are two numbers you care about: how much \\nmoney you're putting in, and the valuation of the company. The valuation determines how much \\nstock you get. If you put $50,000 into a company at a pre-money valuation of $1 million, then \\nthe post-money valuation is $1.05 million, and you get .05/1.05, or 4.76% of the company's \\nstock.\\nIf the company raises more money later, the new investor will take a chunk of the company \\naway from all the existing shareholders just as you did. If in the next round they sell 10% of the \\ncompany to a new investor, your 4.76% will be reduced to 4.28%.\\nThat's \", \"take a chunk of the company \\naway from all the existing shareholders just as you did. If in the next round they sell 10% of the \\ncompany to a new investor, your 4.76% will be reduced to 4.28%.\\nThat's ok. Dilution is normal. What saves you from being mistreated in future rounds, usually, is \\nthat you're in the same boat as the founders. They can't dilute you without diluting themselves \\njust as much. And they won't dilute themselves unless they end up net ahead. So in theory, \\neach further round of investment leaves you with a smaller share of an even more valuable \\ncompany, till after several more rounds you end up with .5% of the company at the point where \\nit IPOs, and you are very happy because your $50,000 has become $5 million. [3]\\nThe agreement by which you invest should have provisions that let you contribute to future \\nrounds to maintain your percentage. So it's your choice whether you get diluted. [4] If the \\ncompany does really well, you eventually will, because eventually th\", \"ons that let you contribute to future \\nrounds to maintain your percentage. So it's your choice whether you get diluted. [4] If the \\ncompany does really well, you eventually will, because eventually the valuations will get so high \\nit's not worth it for you.\\nHow much does an angel invest? That varies enormously, from $10,000 to hundreds of \\nthousands or in rare cases even millions. The upper bound is obviously the total amount the \\nfounders want to raise. The lower bound is 5-10% of the total or $10,000, whichever is greater. \\nA typical angel round these days might be $150,000 raised from 5 people.\\nValuations don't vary as much. For angel rounds it's rare to see a valuation lower than half a \\nmillion or higher than 4 or 5 million. 4 million is starting to be VC territory.\\nHow do you decide what valuation to offer? If you're part of a round led by someone else, that \\nproblem is solved for you. But what if you're investing by yourself? There's no real answer. \\nThere is no rational way to \", \"what valuation to offer? If you're part of a round led by someone else, that \\nproblem is solved for you. But what if you're investing by yourself? There's no real answer. \\nThere is no rational way to value an early stage startup. The valuation reflects nothing more \\nthan the strength of the company's bargaining position. If they really want you, either because \\nthey desperately need money, or you're someone who can help them a lot, they'll let you invest \\nat a low valuation. If they don't need you, it will be higher. So guess. The startup may not have \\nany more idea what the number should be than you do. [5]\\nUltimately it doesn't matter much. When angels make a lot of money from a deal, it's not \\nbecause they invested at a valuation of $1.5 million instead of $3 million. It's because the \\ncompany was really successful.\\nI can't emphasize that too much. Don't get hung up on mechanics or deal terms. What you \\nshould spend your time thinking about is whether the company is good.\\n(Similarly\", \"company was really successful.\\nI can't emphasize that too much. Don't get hung up on mechanics or deal terms. What you \\nshould spend your time thinking about is whether the company is good.\\n(Similarly, founders also should not get hung up on deal terms, but should spend their time \\nthinking about how to make the company good.)\\nThere's a second less obvious component of an angel investment: how much you're expected \\nto help the startup. Like the amount you invest, this can vary a lot. You don't have to do anything \\nif you don't want to; you could simply be a source of money. Or you can become a de facto \\nemployee of the company. Just make sure that you and the startup agree in advance about \\nroughly how much you'll do for them.\\nReally hot companies sometimes have high standards for angels. The ones everyone wants to \\ninvest in practically audition investors, and only take money from people who are famous and/or \\nwill work hard for them. But don't feel like you have to put in a lot of ti\", \"The ones everyone wants to \\ninvest in practically audition investors, and only take money from people who are famous and/or \\nwill work hard for them. But don't feel like you have to put in a lot of time or you won't get to \\ninvest in any good startups. There is a surprising lack of correlation between how hot a deal a \\nstartup is and how well it ends up doing. Lots of hot startups will end up failing, and lots of \\nstartups no one likes will end up succeeding. And the latter are so desperate for money that \\nthey'll take it from anyone at a low valuation. [6]\\nPicking Winners\\nIt would be nice to be able to pick those out, wouldn't it? The part of angel investing that has \\nmost effect on your returns, picking the right companies, is also the hardest. So you should \\npractically ignore (or more precisely, archive, in the Gmail sense) everything I've told you so far. \\nYou may need to refer to it at some point, but it is not the central issue.\\nThe central issue is picking the right startups. W\", 'precisely, archive, in the Gmail sense) everything I\\'ve told you so far. \\nYou may need to refer to it at some point, but it is not the central issue.\\nThe central issue is picking the right startups. What \"Make something people want\" is for \\nstartups, \"Pick the right startups\" is for investors. Combined they yield \"Pick the startups that \\nwill make something people want.\"\\nHow do you do that? It\\'s not as simple as picking startups that are already making something \\nwildly popular. By then it\\'s too late for angels. VCs will already be onto them. As an angel, you \\nhave to pick startups before they\\'ve got a hit—either because they\\'ve made something great but \\nusers don\\'t realize it yet, like Google early on, or because they\\'re still an iteration or two away \\nfrom the big hit, like Paypal when they were making software for transferring money between \\nPDAs.\\nTo be a good angel investor, you have to be a good judge of potential. That\\'s what it comes \\ndown to. VCs can be fast followers. Most of ', 'hey were making software for transferring money between \\nPDAs.\\nTo be a good angel investor, you have to be a good judge of potential. That\\'s what it comes \\ndown to. VCs can be fast followers. Most of them don\\'t try to predict what will win. They just try \\nto notice quickly when something already is winning. But angels have to be able to predict. [7]\\nOne interesting consequence of this fact is that there are a lot of people out there who have \\nnever even made an angel investment and yet are already better angel investors than they \\nrealize. Someone who doesn\\'t know the first thing about the mechanics of venture funding but \\nknows what a successful startup founder looks like is actually far ahead of someone who knows \\ntermsheets inside out, but thinks \"hacker\" means someone who breaks into computers.

[8]\\nPaul Buchheit, for example, started angel investing about a year after me, and he was pretty \\nmuch immediately as good as me at picking startups. My extra year of experience was rounding \\nerror compared to our ability to empathize with founders.\\nWhat makes a good founder? If there were a word that meant the opposite of hapless, that \\nwould be the one. Bad founders seem hapless. They may be smart, or not, but somehow events \\noverwhelm them and they get discouraged and give up. Good founders make things happen the \\nway they want.

But they are relentlessly resourceful. That's the \\nclosest I can get to the opposite of hapless. You want to fund people who are relentlessly \\nresourceful.\\nNotice we started out talking about things, and now we're talking about people. There is an \\nongoing debate between investors which is more important, the people, or the idea—or more \\nprecisely, the market. Some, like Ron Conway, say it's the people—that the idea will change, but \\nthe people are the foundation of the company. Whereas Marc Andreessen says he'd back ok \\nfounders in a hot market over great founders in a bad one. [9]\\nThese two positions are not so far apart as they seem, because good people find good \\nmarkets. Bill Gates would probably have ended up pretty rich even if IBM hadn't happened to \\ndrop the PC standard in his lap.\\nI've thought a lot about the disagreement between the investors who prefer to bet on people \\nand those who prefer to bet on markets.

The three most prominent people I know who favor \\nmarkets are Marc, Jawed Karim, and Joe Kraus. And all three of them, in their own startups, \\nbasically flew into a thermal: they hit a market growing so fast that it was all they could do to \\nkeep up with it. That kind of experience is hard to ignore. Plus I think they underestimate \\nthemselves: they think back to how easy it felt to ride that huge thermal upward, and they think \\n\"anyone could have done it.\" But that isn\\'t true; they are not ordinary people.\\nSo as an angel investor I think you want to go with Ron Conway and bet on people.

How do you find them? This is yet another problem that gets solved for you by \\nsyndicates. If you tag along on a friend's investments, you don't have to find startups.\\nThe problem is not finding startups, exactly, but finding a stream of reasonably high quality \\nones. The traditional way to do this is through contacts. If you're friends with a lot of investors \\nand founders, they'll send deals your way. The Valley basically runs on referrals. And once you \\nstart to become known as reliable, useful investor, people will refer lots of deals to you. I \\ncertainly will.\\nThere's al\", \"'ll send deals your way. The Valley basically runs on referrals. And once you \\nstart to become known as reliable, useful investor, people will refer lots of deals to you.

We have two \\nDemo Days a year, one in March and one in August. These are basically mass referrals.\\nBut events like Demo Day only account for a fraction of matches between startups and \\ninvestors. The personal referral is still the most common route. So if you want to hear about new \\nstartups, the best way to do it is to get lots of referrals.\\nThe best way to get lots of referrals is to invest in startups. No matter how smart and nice you \\nseem, insiders will be reluctant to send you referrals until you've proven yourself by doing a \\ncouple investments.

At the extreme, for someone like Ron Conway, it is basically \\nidentical with the deal flow of the whole Valley.\\nSo if you want to invest seriously, the way to get started is to bootstrap yourself off your existing \\nconnections, be a good investor in the startups you meet that way, and eventually you'll start a \\nchain reaction. Good investors are rare, even in Silicon Valley.

The first thing you need is to be decisive. When we talk \\nto founders about good and bad investors, one of the ways we describe the good ones is to say \\n\"he writes checks.\" That doesn\\'t mean the investor says yes to everyone. Far from it. It means \\nhe makes up his mind quickly, and follows through. You may be thinking, how hard could that \\nbe? You\\'ll see when you try it.

You come across a startup founded by a couple grad students. They say \\nthey\\'re going to work on Internet search. There are already a bunch of big public companies \\ndoing search. How can these grad students possibly compete with them? And does search \\neven matter anyway? All the search engines are trying to get people to start calling them \\n\"portals\" instead.

[1]\\nThe third reason computers won is piracy. Users prefer it not just because it\\'s free, but because \\nit\\'s more convenient.

That is wildly oversimplified, of course, but probably as close to the truth as \\nyou can get in three words.\\n___\\nThe TV networks already seem, grudgingly, to see where things are going, and have responded \\nby putting their stuff, grudgingly, online.

Instead of delivering what viewers want, they're trying to \\nforce them to change their habits to suit the networks' obsolete business model.

[4]\\n___\\nNow would be a good time to start any company that competes with TV networks. That's what a \\nlot of Internet startups are, though they may not have had this as an explicit goal.

That\\'s how Silicon Valley happened. But could you shortcut the process by funding \\nstartups?\\nPossibly. Let\\'s consider what it would take.\\nThe first thing to understand is that encouraging startups is a different problem from \\nencouraging startups in a particular city. The latter is much more expensive.\\nPeople sometimes think they could improve the startup scene in their town by starting \\nsomething like Y Combinator there, but in fact it will have near zero effect. I know because Y \\nCombinator itself had near zero effect on Boston when we were based there half the year. The \\npeople we funded came from all over the country (indeed, the world) and afterward they went \\nwherever they could get more funding—which generally meant Silicon Valley.\\nThe seed funding business is not a regional business, because at that stage startups are \\nmobile. They\\'re just a', \"d they went \\nwherever they could get more funding—which generally meant Silicon Valley.\\nThe seed funding business is not a regional business, because at that stage startups are \\nmobile. They're just a couple founders with laptops. [1]\\nIf you want to encourage startups in a particular city, you have to fund startups that won't leave. \\nThere are two ways to do that: have rules preventing them from leaving, or fund them at the \\npoint in their life when they naturally take root. The first approach is a mistake, because it \\nbecomes a filter for selecting bad startups. If your terms force startups to do things they don't \\nwant to, only the desperate ones will take your money.\\nGood startups will move to another city as a condition of funding. What they won't do is agree \\nnot to move the next time they need funding. So the only way to get them to stay is to give them \\nenough that they never need to leave.\\n___\\nHow much would that take? If you want to keep startups from leaving your town, you ha\", \" they need funding. So the only way to get them to stay is to give them \\nenough that they never need to leave.\\n___\\nHow much would that take? If you want to keep startups from leaving your town, you have to \\ngive them enough that they're not tempted by an offer from Silicon Valley VCs that requires \\nthem to move. A startup would be able to refuse such an offer if they had grown to the point \\nwhere they were (a) rooted in your town and/or (b) so successful that VCs would fund them \\neven if they didn't move.\\nHow much would it cost to grow a startup to that point? A minimum of several hundred \\nthousand dollars. Wufoo seem to have rooted themselves in Tampa on $118k, but they're an \\nextreme case. On average it would take at least half a million.\\nSo if it seems too good to be true to think you could grow a local silicon valley by giving startups \\n$15-20k each like Y Combinator, that's because it is. To make them stick around you'd have to \\ngive them at least 20 times that much.\\nHowever, even\", \"ould grow a local silicon valley by giving startups \\n$15-20k each like Y Combinator, that's because it is. To make them stick around you'd have to \\ngive them at least 20 times that much.\\nHowever, even that is an interesting prospect. Suppose to be on the safe side it would cost a \\nmillion dollars per startup. If you could get startups to stick to your town for a million apiece, \\nthen for a billion dollars you could bring in a thousand startups. That probably wouldn't push you \\npast Silicon Valley itself, but it might get you second place.\\nFor the price of a football stadium, any town that was decent to live in could make itself one of \\nthe biggest startup hubs in the world.\\nWhat's more, it wouldn't take very long. You could probably do it in five years. During the term of \\none mayor. And it would get easier over time, because the more startups you had in town, the \\nless it would take to get new ones to move there. By the time you had a thousand startups in \\ntown, the VCs wouldn't be tr\", \"t would get easier over time, because the more startups you had in town, the \\nless it would take to get new ones to move there. By the time you had a thousand startups in \\ntown, the VCs wouldn't be trying so hard to get them to move to Silicon Valley; instead they'd be \\nopening local offices. Then you'd really be in good shape. You'd have started a self-sustaining \\nchain reaction like the one that drives the Valley.\\n___\\nBut now comes the hard part. You have to pick the startups. How do you do that? Picking \\nstartups is a rare and valuable skill, and the handful of people who have it are not readily \\nhireable. And this skill is so hard to measure that if a government did try to hire people with it, \\nthey'd almost certainly get the wrong ones.\\nFor example, a city could give money to a VC fund to establish a local branch, and let them \\nmake the choices. But only a bad VC fund would take that deal. They wouldn't seem bad to the \\ncity officials. They'd seem very impressive. But they'd be ba\", \"d to establish a local branch, and let them \\nmake the choices. But only a bad VC fund would take that deal. They wouldn't seem bad to the \\ncity officials. They'd seem very impressive. But they'd be bad at picking startups. That's the \\ncharacteristic failure mode of VCs. All VCs look impressive to limited partners. The difference \\nbetween the good ones and the bad ones only becomes visible in the other half of their jobs: \\nchoosing and advising startups. [2]\\nWhat you really want is a pool of local angel investors—people investing money they made \\nfrom their own startups. But unfortunately you run into a chicken and egg problem here. If your \\ncity isn't already a startup hub, there won't be people there who got rich from startups. And \\nthere is no way I can think of that a city could attract angels from outside. By definition they're \\nrich. There's no incentive that would make them move. [3]\\nHowever, a city could select startups by piggybacking on the expertise of investors who weren't \\n\", \" angels from outside. By definition they're \\nrich. There's no incentive that would make them move. [3]\\nHowever, a city could select startups by piggybacking on the expertise of investors who weren't \\nlocal. It would be pretty straightforward to make a list of the most eminent Silicon Valley angels \\nand from that to generate a list of all the startups they'd invested in. If a city offered these \\ncompanies a million dollars each to move, a lot of the earlier stage ones would probably take it.\\nPreposterous as this plan sounds, it's probably the most efficient way a city could select good \\nstartups.\\nIt would hurt the startups somewhat to be separated from their original investors. On the other \\nhand, the extra million dollars would give them a lot more runway.\\n___\\nWould the transplanted startups survive? Quite possibly. The only way to find out would be to \\ntry it. It would be a pretty cheap experiment, as civil expenditures go. Pick 30 startups that \\neminent angels have recently invested \", 'ps survive? Quite possibly. The only way to find out would be to \\ntry it. It would be a pretty cheap experiment, as civil expenditures go. Pick 30 startups that \\neminent angels have recently invested in, give them each a million dollars if they\\'ll relocate to \\nyour city, and see what happens after a year. If they seem to be thriving, you can try importing \\nstartups on a larger scale.\\nDon\\'t be too legalistic about the conditions under which they\\'re allowed to leave. Just have a \\ngentlemen\\'s agreement.\\nDon\\'t try to do it on the cheap and pick only 10 for the initial experiment. If you do this on too \\nsmall a scale you\\'ll just guarantee failure. Startups need to be around other startups. 30 would \\nbe enough to feel like a community.\\nDon\\'t try to make them all work in some renovated warehouse you\\'ve made into an \"incubator.\" \\nReal startups prefer to work in their own spaces.\\nIn fact, don\\'t impose any restrictions on the startups at all. Startup founders are mostly hackers, \\nand hackers are', 'you\\'ve made into an \"incubator.\" \\nReal startups prefer to work in their own spaces.\\nIn fact, don\\'t impose any restrictions on the startups at all. Startup founders are mostly hackers, \\nand hackers are much more constrained by gentlemen\\'s agreements than regulations. If they \\nshake your hand on a promise, they\\'ll keep it. But show them a lock and their first thought is \\nhow to pick it.\\nInterestingly, the 30-startup experiment could be done by any sufficiently rich private citizen. \\nAnd what pressure it would put on the city if it worked. [4]\\n___\\nShould the city take stock in return for the money? In principle they\\'re entitled to, but how would \\nthey choose valuations for the startups? You couldn\\'t just give them all the same valuation: that \\nwould be too low for some (who\\'d turn you down) and too high for others (because it might \\nmake their next round a \"down round\"). And since we\\'re assuming we\\'re doing this without \\nbeing able to pick startups, we also have to assume we can\\'t value t', 'nd too high for others (because it might \\nmake their next round a \"down round\"). And since we\\'re assuming we\\'re doing this without \\nbeing able to pick startups, we also have to assume we can\\'t value them, since that\\'s practically \\nthe same thing.\\nAnother reason not to take stock in the startups is that startups are often involved in \\ndisreputable things. So are established companies, but they don\\'t get blamed for it. If someone \\ngets murdered by someone they met on Facebook, the press will treat the story as if it were \\nabout Facebook. If someone gets murdered by someone they met at a supermarket, the press \\nwill just treat it as a story about a murder. So understand that if you invest in startups, they \\nmight build things that get used for pornography, or file-sharing, or the expression of \\nunfashionable opinions. You should probably sponsor this project jointly with your political \\nopponents, so they can\\'t use whatever the startups do as a club to beat you with.\\nIt would be too much ', 'f \\nunfashionable opinions. You should probably sponsor this project jointly with your political \\nopponents, so they can\\'t use whatever the startups do as a club to beat you with.\\nIt would be too much of a political liability just to give the startups the money, though. So the \\nbest plan would be to make it convertible debt, but which didn\\'t convert except in a really big \\nround, like $20 million.\\n___\\nHow well this scheme worked would depend on the city. There are some towns, like Portland, \\nthat would be easy to turn into startup hubs, and others, like Detroit, where it would really be an \\nuphill battle. So be honest with yourself about the sort of town you have before you try this.\\nIt will be easier in proportion to how much your town resembles San Francisco. Do you have \\ngood weather? Do people live downtown, or have they abandoned the center for the suburbs? \\nWould the city be described as \"hip\" and \"tolerant,\" or as reflecting \"traditional values?\" Are \\nthere good universities near', ' people live downtown, or have they abandoned the center for the suburbs? \\nWould the city be described as \"hip\" and \"tolerant,\" or as reflecting \"traditional values?\" Are \\nthere good universities nearby? Are there walkable neighborhoods? Would nerds feel at home? \\nIf you answered yes to all these questions, you might be able not only to pull off this scheme, \\nbut to do it for less than a million per startup.\\nI realize the chance of any city having the political will to carry out this plan is microscopically \\nsmall. I just wanted to explore what it would take if one did. How hard would it be to jumpstart a \\nsilicon valley? It\\'s fascinating to think this prize might be within the reach of so many cities. So \\neven though they\\'ll all still spend the money on the stadium, at least now someone can ask \\nthem: why did you choose to do that instead of becoming a serious rival to Silicon Valley?\\nNotes:\\n[1] What people who start these supposedly local seed firms always find is that (a) their appl', \"an ask \\nthem: why did you choose to do that instead of becoming a serious rival to Silicon Valley?\\nNotes:\\n[1] What people who start these supposedly local seed firms always find is that (a) their applicants come from all \\nover, not just the local area, and (b) the local startups also apply to the other seed firms. So what ends up happening \\nis that the applicant pool gets partitioned by quality rather than geography.\\n[2] Interestingly, the bad VCs fail by choosing startups run by people like them—people who are good presenters, but \\nhave no real substance.

Initially it was supposed to be a side project—an \\napplication to sharpen Arc on, and a place for current and future Y Combinator founders to \\nexchange news. It's grown bigger and taken up more time than I expected, but I don't regret that \\nbecause I've learned so much from working on it.\\nGrowth\\nWhen we launched in February 2007, weekday traffic was around 1600 daily uniques. It's since \\ngrown to around 22,000. This growth rate is a bit higher than I'd like. I'd like the site to grow, \\nsince a site that isn't growing at least slowly is probably dead. But I wouldn't want it to grow as \\nlarge as Digg or Reddit—mainly because that would dilute th\", \"n I'd like. I'd like the site to grow, \\nsince a site that isn't growing at least slowly is probably dead. But I wouldn't want it to grow as \\nlarge as Digg or Reddit—mainly because that would dilute the character of the site, but also \\nbecause I don't want to spend all my time dealing with scaling.\\nI already have problems enough with that. Remember, the original motivation for HN was to test \\na new programming language, and moreover one that's focused on experimenting with \\nlanguage design, not performance. Every time the site gets slow, I fortify myself by recalling \\nMcIlroy and Bentley's famous quote The key to performance is elegance, not battalions of \\nspecial cases. and look for the bottleneck I can remove with least code. So far I've been able to \\nkeep up, in the sense that performance has remained consistently mediocre despite 14x \\ngrowth. I don't know what I'll do next, but I'll probably think of something.\\nThis is my attitude to the site generally. Hacker News is an experiment,\", 'e has remained consistently mediocre despite 14x \\ngrowth. I don\\'t know what I\\'ll do next, but I\\'ll probably think of something.\\nThis is my attitude to the site generally. Hacker News is an experiment, and an experiment in a \\nvery young field. Sites of this type are only a few years old. Internet conversation generally is \\nonly a few decades old. So we\\'ve probably only discovered a fraction of what we eventually will.\\nThat\\'s why I\\'m so optimistic about HN. When a technology is this young, the existing solutions \\nare usually terrible; which means it must be possible to do much better; which means many \\nproblems that seem insoluble aren\\'t. Including, I hope, the problem that has afflicted so many \\nprevious communities: being ruined by growth.\\nDilution\\nUsers have worried about that since the site was a few months old. So far these alarms have \\nbeen false, but they may not always be. Dilution is a hard problem. But probably soluble; it \\ndoesn\\'t mean much that open conversations have \"always', 'ite was a few months old. So far these alarms have \\nbeen false, but they may not always be. Dilution is a hard problem. But probably soluble; it \\ndoesn\\'t mean much that open conversations have \"always\" been destroyed by growth when \\n\"always\" equals 20 instances.\\nBut it\\'s important to remember we\\'re trying to solve a new problem, because that means we\\'re \\ngoing to have to try new things, most of which probably won\\'t work. A couple weeks ago I tried \\ndisplaying the names of users with the highest average comment scores in orange. [1] That was \\na mistake. Suddenly a culture that had been more or less united was divided into haves and \\nhave-nots. I didn\\'t realize how united the culture had been till I saw it divided. It was painful to \\nwatch. [2]\\nSo orange usernames won\\'t be back. (Sorry about that.) But there will be other equally broken-\\nseeming ideas in the future, and the ones that turn out to work will probably seem just as \\nbroken as those that don\\'t.\\nProbably the most important thin', \" that.) But there will be other equally broken-\\nseeming ideas in the future, and the ones that turn out to work will probably seem just as \\nbroken as those that don't.\\nProbably the most important thing I've learned about dilution is that it's measured more in \\nbehavior than users. It's bad behavior you want to keep out more than bad people. User \\nbehavior turns out to be surprisingly malleable. If people are expected to behave well, they tend \\nto; and vice versa.\\nThough of course forbidding bad behavior does tend to keep away bad people, because they \\nfeel uncomfortably constrained in a place where they have to behave well. But this way of \\nkeeping them out is gentler and probably also more effective than overt barriers.\\nIt's pretty clear now that the broken windows theory applies to community sites as well. The \\ntheory is that minor forms of bad behavior encourage worse ones: that a neighborhood with lots \\nof graffiti and broken windows becomes one where robberies occur. I was living \", \"nity sites as well. The \\ntheory is that minor forms of bad behavior encourage worse ones: that a neighborhood with lots \\nof graffiti and broken windows becomes one where robberies occur. I was living in New York \\nwhen Giuliani introduced the reforms that made the broken windows theory famous, and the \\ntransformation was miraculous. And I was a Reddit user when the opposite happened there, \\nand the transformation was equally dramatic.\\nI'm not criticizing Steve and Alexis. What happened to Reddit didn't happen out of neglect. From \\nthe start they had a policy of censoring nothing except spam. Plus Reddit had different goals \\nfrom Hacker News. Reddit was a startup, not a side project; its goal was to grow as fast as \\npossible. Combine rapid growth and zero censorship, and the result is a free for all. But I don't \\nthink they'd do much differently if they were doing it again. Measured by traffic, Reddit is much \\nmore successful than Hacker News.\\nBut what happened to Reddit won't inevitably\", \" for all. But I don't \\nthink they'd do much differently if they were doing it again. Measured by traffic, Reddit is much \\nmore successful than Hacker News.\\nBut what happened to Reddit won't inevitably happen to HN. There are several local maxima. \\nThere can be places that are free for alls and places that are more thoughtful, just as there are \\nin the real world; and people will behave differently depending on which they're in, just as they \\ndo in the real world.\\nI've observed this in the wild. I've seen people cross-posting on Reddit and Hacker News who \\nactually took the trouble to write two versions, a flame for Reddit and a more subdued version \\nfor HN.\\nSubmissions\\nThere are two major types of problems a site like Hacker News needs to avoid: bad stories and \\nbad comments. So far the danger of bad stories seems smaller. The stories on the frontpage \\nnow are still roughly the ones that would have been there when HN started.\\nI once thought I'd have to weight votes to keep crap off the\", \"nger of bad stories seems smaller. The stories on the frontpage \\nnow are still roughly the ones that would have been there when HN started.\\nI once thought I'd have to weight votes to keep crap off the frontpage, but I haven't had to yet. I \\nwouldn't have predicted the frontpage would hold up so well, and I'm not sure why it has. \\nPerhaps only the more thoughtful users care enough to submit and upvote links, so the \\nmarginal cost of one random new user approaches zero. Or perhaps the frontpage protects \\nitself, by advertising what type of submission is expected.\\nThe most dangerous thing for the frontpage is stuff that's too easy to upvote. If someone proves \\na new theorem, it takes some work by the reader to decide whether or not to upvote it. An \\namusing cartoon takes less. A rant with a rallying cry as the title takes zero, because people \\nvote it up without even reading it.\\nHence what I call the Fluff Principle: on a user-voted news site, the links that are easiest to \\njudge will tak\", \"allying cry as the title takes zero, because people \\nvote it up without even reading it.\\nHence what I call the Fluff Principle: on a user-voted news site, the links that are easiest to \\njudge will take over unless you take specific measures to prevent it.\\nHacker News has two kinds of protections against fluff. The most common types of fluff links \\nare banned as off-topic. Pictures of kittens, political diatribes, and so on are explicitly banned. \\nThis keeps out most fluff, but not all of it. Some links are both fluff, in the sense of being very \\nshort, and also on topic.\\nThere's no single solution to that. If a link is just an empty rant, editors will sometimes kill it even \\nif it's on topic in the sense of being about hacking, because it's not on topic by the real \\nstandard, which is to engage one's intellectual curiosity. If the posts on a site are \\ncharacteristically of this type I sometimes ban it, which means new stuff at that url is auto-killed. \\nIf a post has a linkbait title, e\", 'ngage one\\'s intellectual curiosity. If the posts on a site are \\ncharacteristically of this type I sometimes ban it, which means new stuff at that url is auto-killed. \\nIf a post has a linkbait title, editors sometimes rephrase it to be more matter-of-fact. This is \\nespecially necessary with links whose titles are rallying cries, because otherwise they become \\nimplicit \"vote up if you believe such-and-such\" posts, which are the most extreme form of fluff.\\nThe techniques for dealing with links have to evolve, because the links do. The existence of \\naggregators has already affected what they aggregate. Writers now deliberately write things to \\ndraw traffic from aggregators—sometimes even specific ones. (No, the irony of this statement is \\nnot lost on me.) Then there are the more sinister mutations, like linkjacking—posting a \\nparaphrase of someone else\\'s article and submitting that instead of the original. These can get \\na lot of upvotes, because a lot of what\\'s good in an article often su', \"ions, like linkjacking—posting a \\nparaphrase of someone else's article and submitting that instead of the original. These can get \\na lot of upvotes, because a lot of what's good in an article often survives; indeed, the closer the \\nparaphrase is to plagiarism, the more survives. [3]\\nI think it's important that a site that kills submissions provide a way for users to see what got \\nkilled if they want to. That keeps editors honest, and just as importantly, makes users confident \\nthey'd know if the editors stopped being honest. HN users can do this by flipping a switch called \\nshowdead in their profile. [4]\\nComments\\nBad comments seem to be a harder problem than bad submissions. While the quality of links \\non the frontpage of HN hasn't changed much, the quality of the median comment may have \\ndecreased somewhat.\\nThere are two main kinds of badness in comments: meanness and stupidity. There is a lot of \\noverlap between the two—mean comments are disproportionately likely also to be dumb—but \", \"decreased somewhat.\\nThere are two main kinds of badness in comments: meanness and stupidity. There is a lot of \\noverlap between the two—mean comments are disproportionately likely also to be dumb—but \\nthe strategies for dealing with them are different. Meanness is easier to control. You can have \\nrules saying one shouldn't be mean, and if you enforce them it seems possible to keep a lid on \\nmeanness.\\nKeeping a lid on stupidity is harder, perhaps because stupidity is not so easily distinguishable. \\nMean people are more likely to know they're being mean than stupid people are to know they're \\nbeing stupid.\\nThe most dangerous form of stupid comment is not the long but mistaken argument, but the \\ndumb joke. Long but mistaken arguments are actually quite rare. There is a strong correlation \\nbetween comment quality and length; if you wanted to compare the quality of comments on \\ncommunity sites, average length would be a good predictor. Probably the cause is human \\nnature rather than anythin\", \"ween comment quality and length; if you wanted to compare the quality of comments on \\ncommunity sites, average length would be a good predictor. Probably the cause is human \\nnature rather than anything specific to comment threads. Probably it's simply that stupidity more \\noften takes the form of having few ideas than wrong ones.\\nWhatever the cause, stupid comments tend to be short. And since it's hard to write a short \\ncomment that's distinguished for the amount of information it conveys, people try to distinguish \\nthem instead by being funny. The most tempting format for stupid comments is the supposedly \\nwitty put-down, probably because put-downs are the easiest form of humor. [5] So one \\nadvantage of forbidding meanness is that it also cuts down on these.\\nBad comments are like kudzu: they take over rapidly. Comments have much more effect on new \\ncomments than submissions have on new submissions. If someone submits a lame article, the \\nother submissions don't all become lame. But if \", \"ey take over rapidly. Comments have much more effect on new \\ncomments than submissions have on new submissions. If someone submits a lame article, the \\nother submissions don't all become lame. But if someone posts a stupid comment on a thread, \\nthat sets the tone for the region around it. People reply to dumb jokes with dumb jokes.\\nMaybe the solution is to add a delay before people can respond to a comment, and make the \\nlength of the delay inversely proportional to some prediction of its quality. Then dumb threads \\nwould grow slower. [6]\\nPeople\\nI notice most of the techniques I've described are conservative: they're aimed at preserving the \\ncharacter of the site rather than enhancing it. I don't think that's a bias of mine. It's due to the \\nshape of the problem. Hacker News had the good fortune to start out good, so in this case it's \\nliterally a matter of preservation. But I think this principle would also apply to sites with different \\norigins.\\nThe good things in a community site co\", \"ortune to start out good, so in this case it's \\nliterally a matter of preservation. But I think this principle would also apply to sites with different \\norigins.\\nThe good things in a community site come from people more than technology; it's mainly in the \\nprevention of bad things that technology comes into play. Technology certainly can enhance \\ndiscussion. Nested comments do, for example. But I'd rather use a site with primitive features \\nand smart, nice users than a more advanced one whose users were idiots or trolls.\\nSo the most important thing a community site can do is attract the kind of people it wants. A site \\ntrying to be as big as possible wants to attract everyone. But a site aiming at a particular subset \\nof users has to attract just those—and just as importantly, repel everyone else. I've made a \\nconscious effort to do this on HN. The graphic design is as plain as possible, and the site rules \\ndiscourage dramatic link titles.

The graphic design is as plain as possible, and the site rules \\ndiscourage dramatic link titles. The goal is that the only thing to interest someone arriving at HN \\nfor the first time should be the ideas expressed there.\\nThe downside of tuning a site to attract certain people is that, to those people, it can be too \\nattractive. I'm all too aware how addictive Hacker News can be. For me, as for many users, it's a \\nkind of virtual town square. When I want to take a break from working, I walk into the square, \\njust as I might into Harvard Square or University Ave in the physical world. [7] But an online \\nsquare is more dangerous than a physical one. If I spent half the day loitering on University Ave, \\nI'd notice.

Someone is wrong on the Internet, and you're \\nfixing the problem.\\nHacker News is definitely useful. I've learned a lot from things I've read on HN. I've written \\nseveral essays that began as comments there. So I wouldn't want the site to go away. But I \\nwould like to be sure it's not a net drag on productivity. What a disaster that would be, to attract \\nthousands of smart people to a site that caused them to waste lots of time. I wish I could be \\n100% sure that's not a description of HN.\\nI feel like the addictiveness of games and social applications is still a mostly unsolved problem. \\nThe situation now is like it was with crack in the 1980s: we've invented terribly addictive new \\nthings, and we haven't yet evolved ways to protect ourselves from them.

Median may be the more accurate predictor of low quality though.\\n[2] Another thing I learned from this experiment is that if you're going to distinguish between people, you better be \\nsure you do it right. This is one problem where rapid prototyping doesn't work.\\nIndeed, that's the intellectually honest argument for not discriminating between various types of people.

The root of the problem is not that the guys running Digg are \\nespecially sneaky, but that they use the wrong algorithm for generating their frontpage. Instead of bubbling up from \\nthe bottom as they get more votes, as on Reddit, stories start at the top and get pushed down by new arrivals.\\nThe reason for the difference is that Digg is derived from Slashdot, while Reddit is derived from Delicious/popular. \\nDigg is Slashdot with voting instead of editors, and Reddit is Delicious/popular with voting instead of bookmarking. \\n(You can still see fossils of their origins in their graphic design.)\\nDigg's algorithm is very vulnerable to gaming, because any story that makes it onto the frontpage i\", 'oting instead of bookmarking. \\n(You can still see fossils of their origins in their graphic design.)\\nDigg\\'s algorithm is very vulnerable to gaming, because any story that makes it onto the frontpage is the new top \\nstory.

Then I \\nthought: what would the other 9 be?\\nWhen I made the list there turned out to be 13: 1. Pick good cofounders.\\nCofounders are for a startup what location is for real estate. You can change anything about a \\nhouse except where it is. In a startup you can change your idea easily, but changing your \\ncofounders is hard.

Let your idea evolve.\\nThis is the second half of launching fast. Launch fast and iterate. It's a big mistake to treat a \\nstartup as if it were merely a matter of implementing some brilliant initial idea. As in an essay, \\nmost of the ideas appear in the implementing.\\n4. Understand your users.\\nYou can envision the wealth created by a startup as a rectangle, where one side is the number \\nof users and the other is how much you improve their lives. [2] The second dimension is the one \\nyou have most control over. And indeed, the growth in the first will be driven by how well you do \\nin the \", \"users and the other is how much you improve their lives. [2] The second dimension is the one \\nyou have most control over. And indeed, the growth in the first will be driven by how well you do \\nin the second. As in science, the hard part is not answering questions but asking them: the hard \\npart is seeing something new that users lack. The better you understand them the better the \\nodds of doing that. That's why so many successful startups make something the founders \\nneeded.\\n5. Better to make a few users love you than a lot ambivalent.\\nIdeally you want to make large numbers of users love you, but you can't expect to hit that right \\naway. Initially you have to choose between satisfying all the needs of a subset of potential \\nusers, or satisfying a subset of the needs of all potential users. Take the first. It's easier to \\nexpand userwise than satisfactionwise. And perhaps more importantly, it's harder to lie to \\nyourself.

Whereas it's easy to know how many users you have.\\n6. Offer surprisingly good customer service.\\nCustomers are used to being maltreated. Most of the companies they deal with are quasi-\\nmonopolies that get away with atrocious customer service. Your own ideas about what's \\npossible have been unconsciously lowered by such experiences. Try making your customer \\nservice not merely good, but surprisingly good. Go out of your way to make people happy. \\nThey'll be overwhelmed; you'll see. In the earliest stages of a startup, it pays to offer customer \\nservice on a level that wouldn't scale, because it's a way of learning about your users.\\n7. You make what you measure.\\nI learned this one from Joe Kraus.

You make what you measure.\\nI learned this one from Joe Kraus. [3] Merely measuring something has an uncanny tendency to \\nimprove it.

You\\'ll be delighted when it goes up and disappointed \\nwhen it goes down. Pretty soon you\\'ll start noticing what makes the number go up, and you\\'ll \\nstart to do more of that. Corollary: be careful what you measure.\\n8. Spend little.\\nI can\\'t emphasize enough how important it is for a startup to be cheap. Most startups fail before \\nthey make something people want, and the most common form of failure is running out of \\nmoney. So being cheap is (almost) interchangeable with iterating rapidly. [4] But it\\'s more than \\nthat. A culture of cheapness keeps companies young in something like the way exercise keeps \\npeople young.\\n9.

It\\'s \\nnot rapid prototyping for business models (though it can be), but more a way of hacking the \\ninvestment process. Once you cross over into ramen profitable, it completely changes your \\nrelationship with investors. It\\'s also great for morale.\\n10.

Paradoxically, \\nfundraising is this type of distraction, so try to minimize that too.\\n11. Don't get demoralized.\\nThough the immediate cause of death in a startup tends to be running out of money, the \\nunderlying cause is usually lack of focus. Either the company is run by stupid people (which \\ncan't be fixed with advice) or the people are smart but got demoralized. Starting a startup is a \\nhuge moral weight. Understand this and make a conscious effort not to be ground down by it, \\njust as you'd be careful to bend at the knees when picking up a heavy box.\\n12. Don't give up.\\nEven if you get demoralized, don't give up. You can get surprisingly far by just not giving up. \\nThis isn't true in all fields. There are a lot of people who couldn't become good mathematicians \\nno matter how long they persisted. But startups aren't like that.

But startups aren't like that. Sheer effort is usually enough, \\nso long as you keep morphing your idea.\\n13. Deals fall through.\\nOne of the most useful skills we learned from Viaweb was not getting our hopes up. We \\nprobably had 20 deals of various types fall through. After the first 10 or so we learned to treat \\ndeals as background processes that we should ignore till they terminated. It's very dangerous to \\nmorale to start to depend on deals closing, not just because they so often don't, but because it \\nmakes them less likely to. Having gotten it down to 13 sentences, I asked myself which I'd \\nchoose if I could only keep one.\\nUnderstand your users. That's the key. The essential task in a startup is to create wealth; the \\ndimension of wealth you have most control over is how much you improve users' lives; and the \\nhardest part of that is knowing what to make for them.

That's the reason to launch \\nearly, to understand your users. Evolving your idea is the embodiment of understanding your \\nusers. Understanding your users well will tend to push you toward making something that \\nmakes a few people deeply happy. The most important reason for having surprisingly good \\ncustomer service is that it helps you understand your users. And understanding your users will \\neven ensure your morale, because when everything else is collapsing around you, having just \\nten users who love you will keep you going.\\nNotes:\\n[1] Strictly speaking it's impossible without a time machine.\\n[2] In practice it's more like a ragged comb.\\n[3] Joe thinks one of the founders of Hewlett Packard said it first, but he doesn't r\", \"Notes:\\n[1] Strictly speaking it's impossible without a time machine.\\n[2] In practice it's more like a ragged comb.\\n[3] Joe thinks one of the founders of Hewlett Packard said it first, but he doesn't remember which.\\n[4] They'd be interchangeable if markets stood still.

There are certainly some political questions that have definite answers, like \\nhow much a new government policy will cost. But the more precise political questions suffer the \\nsame fate as the vaguer ones.\\nI think what religion and politics have in common is that they become part of people's identity, \\nand people can never have a fruitful argument about something that's part of their identity. By \\ndefinition they're partisan.\\nWhich topics engage people's identity depends on the people, not the topic. For example, a \\ndiscussion about a battle that included citizens of one or more of the countries involved would \\nprobably degenerate into a political argument. But a discussion today about a battle that took \\nplace in the Bronze Age probably wouldn't. No one would know what side to be on. So it's not \\npolitics that's the source of the trouble, but identity. When people say a discussion has \\ndegenerated into a religious war,\", \"e Age probably wouldn't.

[1]\\nBecause the point at which this happens depends on the people rather than the topic, it's a \\nmistake to conclude that because a question tends to provoke religious wars, it must have no \\nanswer. For example, the question of the relative merits of programming languages often \\ndegenerates into a religious war, because so many programmers identify as X programmers or \\nY programmers. This sometimes leads people to conclude the question must be unanswerable\\n—that all languages are equally good. Obviously that's false: anything else people make can be \\nwell or badly designed; why should this be uniquely impossible for programming languages? \\nAnd indeed, you can have a fruitful discussion about the rela\", \"that's false: anything else people make can be \\nwell or badly designed; why should this be uniquely impossible for programming languages? \\nAnd indeed, you can have a fruitful discussion about the relative merits of programming \\nlanguages, so long as you exclude people who respond from identity.\\nMore generally, you can have a fruitful discussion about a topic only if it doesn't engage the \\nidentities of any of the participants. What makes politics and religion such minefields is that they \\nengage so many people's identities. But you could in principle have a useful conversation about \\nthem with some people. And there are other topics that might seem harmless, like the relative \\nmerits of Ford and Chevy pickup trucks, that you couldn't safely talk about with others.\\nThe most intriguing thing about this theory, if it's right, is that it explains not merely which kinds \\nof discussions to avoid, but how to have better ideas.

It's a fine thing for parents \\nto help their children indirectly—for example, by helping them to become smarter or more \\ndisciplined, which then makes them more successful. The problem comes when parents use \\ndirect methods: when they are able to use their own wealth or power as a substitute for their \\nchildren's qualities.\\nParents will tend to do this when they can.

But a bunch of small organizations in a market can come \\nclose. A market takes every organization and keeps just the good ones.

In the culture of a large organization, an elite \\npedigree becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.\\nThis doesn't work in small companies.

And if they do, they may not \\nreconverge once the economy gets better.\\nThe reason startups no longer depend so much on VCs is one that everyone in the startup \\nbusiness knows by now: it has gotten much cheaper to start a startup. There are four main \\nreasons: Moore's law has made hardware cheap; open source has made software free; the web \\nhas made marketing and distribution free; and more powerful programming languages mean \\ndevelopment teams can be smaller.

In a lot of startups—probaby most startups funded by Y Combinator—the \\nbiggest expense is simply the founders\\' living expenses. We\\'ve had startups that were profitable \\non revenues of $3000 a month.\\n$3000 is insignificant as revenues go. Why should anyone care about a startup making $3000 a \\nmonth? Because, although insignificant as revenue, this amount of money can change a \\nstartup\\'s funding situation completely.\\nSomeone running a startup is always calculating in the back of their mind how much \"runway\" \\nthey have—how long they have till the money in the bank runs out and they either have to be \\nprofitable, raise more money, or go out of business.

It's a qualitative change, like the stars turning into \\nlines and disappearing when the Enterprise accelerates to warp speed. Once you're profitable \\nyou don't need investors' money. And because Internet startups have become so cheap to run, \\nthe threshold of profitability can be trivially low. Which means many Internet startups don't need \\nVC-scale investments anymore. For many startups, VC funding has, in the language of VCs, \\ngone from a must-have to a nice-to-have.\\nThis change happened while no one was looking, and its effects have been largely masked so \\nfar. It was during the trough after the Internet Bubble that it became trivially cheap to start a \\nstartup, but few realized it because startups were so out of fashion.

As long as VCs were writing checks, founders \\nwere never forced to explore the limits of how little they needed them. There were a few \\nstartups who hit these limits accidentally because of their unusual circumstances—most \\nfamously 37signals, which hit the limit because they crossed into startup land from the other \\ndirection: they started as a consulting firm, so they had revenue before they had a product.\\nVCs and founders are like two components that used to be bolted together.

A sharp impact \\nwould make them fly apart. And the present recession could be that impact.\\nBecause of Y Combinator's position at the extreme end of the spectrum, we'd be the first to see \\nsigns of a separation between founders and investors, and we are in fact seeing it. For example, \\nthough the stock market crash does seem to have made investors more cautious, it doesn't \\nseem to have had any effect on the number of people who want to start startups.

That's different from the way \\nthings felt in 2001. Then there was a widespread feeling among potential founders that startups \\nwere over, and that one should just go to grad school. That isn't happening this time, and part of \\nthe reason is that even in a bad economy it's not that hard to build something that makes $3000 \\na month.

So I asked them if they wanted me to introduce them to more investors. \\nTo my surprise, they said no—that they\\'d just spent four months dealing with investors, and they \\nwere actually a lot happier now that they didn\\'t have to.

An ambitious kid \\ngraduating from college in 1960 wanted to work in the huge, gleaming offices of Ford, or \\nGeneral Electric, or NASA. Small meant small-time. Small in 1960 didn\\'t mean a cool little \\nstartup. It meant uncle Sid\\'s shoe store.\\nWhen I grew up in the 1970s, the idea of the \"corporate ladder\" was still very much alive. The \\nstandard plan was to try to get into a good college, from which one would be drafted into some \\norganization and then rise to positions of gradually increasing responsibility. The more \\nambitious merely hoped to climb the same ladder faster. [1]\\nBut in the late twentieth century something changed. It turned out that economies of scale were \\nnot the only force at work. Particularly in technology, the increase in speed one could get from \\nsmaller groups started to trump the advantages of size.\\nThe future turned out to be different from the one we were expecting in 1970.

The domed cities \\nand flying cars we expected have failed to materialize. But fortunately so have the jumpsuits \\nwith badges indicating our specialty and rank. Instead of being dominated by a few, giant tree-\\nstructured organizations, it\\'s now looking like the economy of the future will be a fluid network of \\nsmaller, independent units.\\nIt\\'s not so much that large organizations stopped working. There\\'s no evidence that famously \\nsuccessful organizations like the Roman army or the British East India Company were any less \\nafflicted by protocol and politics than organizations of the same size today. But they were \\ncompeting against opponents who couldn\\'t change the rules on the fly by discovering new \\ntechnology.

Now it turns out the rule \"large and disciplined organizations win\" needs to have a \\nqualification appended: \"at games that change slowly.\" No one knew till change reached a \\nsufficient speed.\\nLarge organizations will start to do worse now, though, because for the first time in history \\nthey\\'re no longer getting the best people. An ambitious kid graduating from college now doesn\\'t \\nwant to work for a big company. They want to work for the hot startup that\\'s rapidly growing into \\none. If they\\'re really ambitious, they want to start it. [2]\\nThis doesn\\'t mean big companies will disappear. To say that startups will succeed implies that \\nbig companies will exist, because startups that succeed either become big companies or are \\nacquired by them. [3] But large organizations will probably never again play the leading role \\nthey did up till the last quarter of the twentieth century.\\nIt\\'s kind of surp', \"ecome big companies or are \\nacquired by them. [3] But large organizations will probably never again play the leading role \\nthey did up till the last quarter of the twentieth century.\\nIt's kind of surprising that a trend that lasted so long would ever run out. How often does it \\nhappen that a rule works for thousands of years, then switches polarity?\\nThe millennia-long run of bigger-is-better left us with a lot of traditions that are now obsolete, \\nbut extremely deeply rooted. Which means the ambitious can now do arbitrage on them. It will \\nbe very valuable to understand precisely which ideas to keep and which can now be discarded.\\nThe place to look is where the spread of smallness began: in the world of startups.\\nThere have always been occasional cases, particularly in the US, of ambitious people who grew \\nthe ladder under them instead of climbing it.

That was a social step \\nno one with a college education would take if they could avoid it. Till the rise of technology \\nstartups, and in particular, Internet startups, it was very unusual for educated people to start \\ntheir own businesses.\\nThe eight men who left Shockley Semiconductor to found Fairchild Semiconductor, the original \\nSilicon Valley startup, weren't even trying to start a company at first. They were just looking for \\na company willing to hire them as a group.

Then one of their parents introduced them to a small \\ninvestment bank that offered to find funding for them to start their own, so they did. But starting \\na company was an alien idea to them; it was something they backed into. [4]\\nNow I would guess that practically every Stanford or Berkeley undergrad who knows how to \\nprogram has at least considered the idea of starting a startup. East Coast universities are not \\nfar behind, and British universities only a little behind them. This pattern suggests that attitudes \\nat Stanford and Berkeley are not an anomaly, but a leading indicator. This is the way the world \\nis going.\\nOf course, Internet startups are still only a fraction of the world's economy. Could a trend based \\non them be that powerful?\\nI think so.

But his work led to more work till that \\nsliver had expanded into something bigger than the whole economy of which it had initially \\nbeen a part.\\nThe same thing could happen with the Internet. If Internet startups offer the best opportunity for \\nambitious people, then a lot of ambitious people will start them, and this bit of the economy will \\nballoon in the usual fractal way.\\nEven if Internet-related applications only become a tenth of the world's economy, this \\ncomponent will set the tone for the rest.

Within a generation of its birth in England, the Industrial Revolution had spread to \\ncontinental Europe and North America. But it didn't spread everywhere.

The techniques for building integrated circuits spread rapidly to other countries. \\nBut the techniques for building startups didn't. Fifty years later, startups are ubiquitous in Silicon \\nValley and common in a handful of other US cities, but they're still an anomaly in most of the \\nworld.\\nPart of the reason—possibly the main reason—that startups have not spread as broadly as the \\nIndustrial Revolution did is their social disruptiveness.

Joel Spolsky recently spoke at Y \\nCombinator about selling software to corporate customers.

If large organizations started to ask questions like that, they'd \\nlearn some frightening things.\\nI think the cost of checks may actually be increasing.

But that's nothing new: startups always have to adapt to the whims \\nof investors. Ask any founder in any economy if they'd describe investors as fickle, and watch \\nthe face they make.

The most important thing is not to let fundraising get you down. Startups \\nlive or die on morale. If you let the difficulty of raising money destroy your morale, it will become \\na self-fulfilling prophecy.\\nBootstrapping (= Consulting)\\nSome would-be founders may by now be thinking, why deal with investors at all?

It\\'s a fine idea in principle to \\nfinance your startup with its own revenues, but you can\\'t create instant customers. Whatever \\nyou make, you have to sell a certain amount to break even. It will take time to grow your sales to \\nthat point, and it\\'s hard to predict, till you try, how long it will take.\\nWe could not have bootstrapped Viaweb, for example. We charged quite a lot for our software—\\nabout $140 per user per month—but it was at least a year before our revenues would have \\ncovered even our paltry costs. We didn\\'t have enough saved to live on for a year.\\nIf you factor out the \"bootstrapped\" companies that were actually funded by their founders \\nthrough savings or a day job, the remainder either (a) got really lucky, which is hard to do on \\ndemand, or (b) began life as consulting companies and gradually transformed themselves into \\nproduct companies.\\nConsulting is the only option you can coun', \"(a) got really lucky, which is hard to do on \\ndemand, or (b) began life as consulting companies and gradually transformed themselves into \\nproduct companies.\\nConsulting is the only option you can count on. But consulting is far from free money. It's not as \\npainful as raising money from investors, perhaps, but the pain is spread over a longer period. \\nYears, probably. And for many types of startup, that delay could be fatal. If you're working on \\nsomething so unusual that no one else is likely to think of it, you can take your time. Joshua \\nSchachter gradually built Delicious on the side while working on Wall Street. He got away with it \\nbecause no one else realized it was a good idea. But if you were building something as \\nobviously necessary as online store software at about the same time as Viaweb, and you were \\nworking on it on the side while spending most of your time on client work, you were not in a \\ngood position.\\nBootstrapping sounds great in principle, but this apparently ver\", \"e as Viaweb, and you were \\nworking on it on the side while spending most of your time on client work, you were not in a \\ngood position.\\nBootstrapping sounds great in principle, but this apparently verdant territory is one from which \\nfew startups emerge alive. The mere fact that bootstrapped startups tend to be famous on that \\naccount should set off alarm bells. If it worked so well, it would be the norm. [3]\\nBootstrapping may get easier, because starting a company is getting cheaper. But I don't think \\nwe'll ever reach the point where most startups can do without outside funding. Technology \\ntends to get dramatically cheaper, but living expenses don't.\\nThe upshot is, you can choose your pain: either the short, sharp pain of raising money, or the \\nchronic ache of consulting. For a given total amount of pain, raising money is the better choice, \\nbecause new technology is usually more valuable now than later.\\nBut although for most startups raising money will be the lesser evil, it's stil\", \"tal amount of pain, raising money is the better choice, \\nbecause new technology is usually more valuable now than later.\\nBut although for most startups raising money will be the lesser evil, it's still a pretty big evil—so \\nbig that it can easily kill you. Not merely in the obvious sense that if you fail to raise money you \\nmight have to shut the company down, but because the process of raising money itself can kill \\nyou.\\nTo survive it you need a set of techniques mostly orthogonal to the ones used in convincing \\ninvestors, just as mountain climbers need to know survival techniques that are mostly \\northogonal to those used in physically getting up and down mountains.\\n1. Have low expectations.\\nThe reason raising money destroys so many startups' morale is not simply that it's hard, but \\nthat it's so much harder than they expected. What kills you is the disappointment. And the lower \\nyour expectations, the harder it is to be disappointed.\\nStartup founders tend to be optimistic. This can w\", ' it\\'s so much harder than they expected. What kills you is the disappointment. And the lower \\nyour expectations, the harder it is to be disappointed.\\nStartup founders tend to be optimistic. This can work well in technology, at least some of the \\ntime, but it\\'s the wrong way to approach raising money. Better to assume investors will always \\nlet you down. Acquirers too, while we\\'re at it. At YC one of our secondary mantras is \"Deals fall \\nthrough.\" No matter what deal you have going on, assume it will fall through. The predictive \\npower of this simple rule is amazing.\\nThere will be a tendency, as a deal progresses, to start to believe it will happen, and then to \\ndepend on it happening. You must resist this. Tie yourself to the mast. This is what kills you. \\nDeals do not have a trajectory like most other human interactions, where shared plans solidify \\nlinearly over time.

Deals often fall through at the last moment. Often the other party doesn't \\nreally think about what they want till the last moment. So you can't use your everyday intuitions \\nabout shared plans as a guide. When it comes to deals, you have to consciously turn them off \\nand become pathologically cynical.\\nThis is harder to do than it sounds. It's very flattering when eminent investors seem interested \\nin funding you. It's easy to start to believe that raising money will be quick and straightforward. \\nBut it hardly ever is.\\n2. Keep working on your startup.\\nIt sounds obvious to say that you should keep working on your startup while raising money. \\nActually this is hard to do. Most startups don't manage to.\\nRaising money has a mysterious capacity to suck up all your attention. Even if you only have \\none meeting a day with investors, somehow that one meeting will burn up your whole day. It \\ncosts not just the t\", \"g money has a mysterious capacity to suck up all your attention. Even if you only have \\none meeting a day with investors, somehow that one meeting will burn up your whole day. It \\ncosts not just the time of the actual meeting, but the time getting there and back, and the time \\npreparing for it beforehand and thinking about it afterward.\\nThe best way to survive the distraction of meeting with investors is probably to partition the \\ncompany: to pick one founder to deal with investors while the others keep the company going. \\nThis works better when a startup has 3 founders than 2, and better when the leader of the \\ncompany is not also the lead developer. In the best case, the company keeps moving forward at \\nabout half speed.\\nThat's the best case, though. More often than not the company comes to a standstill while \\nraising money. And that is dangerous for so many reasons. Raising money always takes longer \\nthan you expect. What seems like it's going to be a 2 week interruption turns into \", \" to a standstill while \\nraising money. And that is dangerous for so many reasons. Raising money always takes longer \\nthan you expect. What seems like it's going to be a 2 week interruption turns into a 4 month \\ninterruption. That can be very demoralizing. And worse still, it can make you less attractive to \\ninvestors. They want to invest in companies that are dynamic. A company that hasn't done \\nanything new in 4 months doesn't seem dynamic, so they start to lose interest. Investors rarely \\ngrasp this, but much of what they're responding to when they lose interest in a startup is the \\ndamage done by their own indecision.\\nThe solution: put the startup first. Fit meetings with investors into the spare moments in your \\ndevelopment schedule, rather than doing development in the spare moments between meetings \\nwith investors. If you keep the company moving forward—releasing new features, increasing \\ntraffic, doing deals, getting written about—those investor meetings are more likely to be \\np\", \"etween meetings \\nwith investors. If you keep the company moving forward—releasing new features, increasing \\ntraffic, doing deals, getting written about—those investor meetings are more likely to be \\nproductive. Not just because your startup will seem more alive, but also because it will be better \\nfor your own morale, which is one of the main ways investors judge you.\\n3. Be conservative.\\nAs conditions get worse, the optimal strategy becomes more conservative. When things go well \\nyou can take risks; when things are bad you want to play it safe.\\nI advise approaching fundraising as if it were always going badly. The reason is that between \\nyour ability to delude yourself and the wildly unstable nature of the system you're dealing with, \\nthings probably either already are or could easily become much worse than they seem.\\nWhat I tell most startups we fund is that if someone reputable offers you funding on reasonable \\nterms, take it.

But in the same \\nposition I'd give the same advice again. Who knows how many bullets were in the gun they \\nwere playing Russian roulette with?\\nCorollary: if an investor seems interested, don't just let them sit. You can't assume someone \\ninterested in investing will stay interested. In fact, you can't even tell (they can't even tell) if \\nthey're really interested till you try to convert that interest into money. So if you have hot \\nprospect, either close them now or write them off. And unless you already have enough funding, \\nthat reduces to: close them now.\\nStartups don't win by getting great funding rounds, but by making great products. So finish \\nraising money and get back to work.\\n4\", 'ss you already have enough funding, \\nthat reduces to: close them now.\\nStartups don\\'t win by getting great funding rounds, but by making great products. So finish \\nraising money and get back to work.\\n4. Be flexible.\\nThere are two questions VCs ask that you shouldn\\'t answer: \"Who else are you talking to?\" and \\n\"How much are you trying to raise?\"\\nVCs don\\'t expect you to answer the first question. They ask it just in case. [4] They do seem to \\nexpect an answer to the second. But I don\\'t think you should just tell them a number. Not as a \\nway to play games with them, but because you shouldn\\'t have a fixed amount you need to raise.\\nThe custom of a startup needing a fixed amount of funding is an obsolete one left over from the \\ndays when startups were more expensive. A company that needed to build a factory or hire 50 \\npeople obviously needed to raise a certain minimum amount. But few technology startups are in \\nthat position today.\\nWe advise startups to tell investors there are several diffe', 'd a factory or hire 50 \\npeople obviously needed to raise a certain minimum amount. But few technology startups are in \\nthat position today.\\nWe advise startups to tell investors there are several different routes they could take depending \\non how much they raised. As little as $50k could pay for food and rent for the founders for a \\nyear. A couple hundred thousand would let them get office space and hire some smart people \\nthey know from school. A couple million would let them really blow this thing out. The message \\n(and not just the message, but the fact) should be: we\\'re going to succeed no matter what. \\nRaising more money just lets us do it faster.\\nIf you\\'re raising an angel round, the size of the round can even change on the fly. In fact, it\\'s just \\nas well to make the round small initially, then expand as needed, rather than trying to raise a \\nlarge round and risk losing the investors you already have if you can\\'t raise the full amount. You \\nmay even want to do a \"rolling close,\" ', 'ially, then expand as needed, rather than trying to raise a \\nlarge round and risk losing the investors you already have if you can\\'t raise the full amount.

That helps break deadlocks, because \\nyou can start as soon as the first one is ready to buy. [5]\\n5. Be independent.\\nA startup with a couple founders in their early twenties can have expenses so low that they \\ncould be profitable on as little as $2000 per month. That\\'s negligible as corporate revenues go, \\nbut the effect on your morale and your bargaining position is anything but. At YC we use the \\nphrase \"ramen profitable\" to describe the situation where you\\'re making just enough to pay your \\nliving expenses. Once you cross into ramen profitable, everything changes.

I myself don't. But if you don't, you can let the numbers speak for you.\\n6. Don't take rejection personally.\\nGetting rejected by investors can make you start to doubt yourself. After all, they're more \\nexperienced than you. If they think your startup is lame, aren't they probably right?\\nMaybe, maybe not. The way to handle rejection is with precision. You shouldn't simply ignore \\nrejection. It might mean something. But you shouldn't automatically get demoralized either.\", \"robably right?\\nMaybe, maybe not. The way to handle rejection is with precision. You shouldn't simply ignore \\nrejection. It might mean something. But you shouldn't automatically get demoralized either.\\nTo understand what rejection means, you have to understand first of all how common it is. \\nStatistically, the average VC is a rejection machine. David Hornik, a partner at August, told me: \\nThe numbers for me ended up being something like 500 to 800 plans received and read, \\nsomewhere between 50 and 100 initial 1 hour meetings held, about 20 companies that I got \\ninterested in, about 5 that I got serious about and did a bunch of work, 1 to 2 deals done in a \\nyear. So the odds are against you. You may be a great entrepreneur, working on interesting \\nstuff, etc. but it is still incredibly unlikely that you get funded. This is less true with angels, but \\nVCs reject practically everyone. The structure of their business means a partner does at most 2 \\nnew investments a year, no matter how many\", \"ely that you get funded. This is less true with angels, but \\nVCs reject practically everyone. The structure of their business means a partner does at most 2 \\nnew investments a year, no matter how many good startups approach him.\\nIn addition to the odds being terrible, the average investor is, as I mentioned, a pretty bad judge \\nof startups. It's harder to judge startups than most other things, because great startup ideas \\ntend to seem wrong. A good startup idea has to be not just good but novel. And to be both good \\nand novel, an idea probably has to seem bad to most people, or someone would already be \\ndoing it and it wouldn't be novel.\\nThat makes judging startups harder than most other things one judges. You have to be an \\nintellectual contrarian to be a good startup investor. That's a problem for VCs, most of whom \\nare not particularly imaginative. VCs are mostly money guys, not people who make things.

VCs are mostly money guys, not people who make things. [7] \\nAngels are better at appreciating novel ideas, because most were founders themselves.\\nSo when you get a rejection, use the data that\\'s in it, and not what\\'s not. If an investor gives you \\nspecific reasons for not investing, look at your startup and ask if they\\'re right. If they\\'re real \\nproblems, fix them. But don\\'t just take their word for it. You\\'re supposed to be the domain expert; \\nyou have to decide.\\nThough a rejection doesn\\'t necessarily tell you anything about your startup, it does suggest \\nyour pitch could be improved. Figure out what\\'s not working and change it. Don\\'t just think \\n\"investors are stupid.\" Often they are, but figure out precisely where you lose them.\\nDon\\'t let rejections pile up as a depressing, undifferentiated heap. Sort them and analyze them, \\nand then instead of thinking \"no one likes us,\" you\\'ll know precisely how big a problem you \\nhav', 'them.\\nDon\\'t let rejections pile up as a depressing, undifferentiated heap. Sort them and analyze them, \\nand then instead of thinking \"no one likes us,\" you\\'ll know precisely how big a problem you \\nhave, and what to do about it.\\n7. Be able to downshift into consulting (if appropriate).\\nConsulting, as I mentioned, is a dangerous way to finance a startup. But it\\'s better than dying. \\nIt\\'s a bit like anaerobic respiration: not the optimum solution for the long term, but it can save \\nyou from an immediate threat. If you\\'re having trouble raising money from investors at all, it \\ncould save you to be able to shift toward consulting.\\nThis works better for some startups than others. It wouldn\\'t have been a natural fit for, say, \\nGoogle, but if your company was making software for building web sites, you could degrade \\nfairly gracefully into consulting by building sites for clients with it.\\nSo long as you were careful not to get sucked permanently into consulting, this could even have \\nadvantage', \", you could degrade \\nfairly gracefully into consulting by building sites for clients with it.\\nSo long as you were careful not to get sucked permanently into consulting, this could even have \\nadvantages. You'd understand your users well if you were using the software for them. Plus as a \\nconsulting company you might be able to get big-name users using your software that you \\nwouldn't have gotten as a product company.\\nAt Viaweb we were forced to operate like a consulting company initially, because we were so \\ndesperate for users that we'd offer to build merchants' sites for them if they'd sign up. But we \\nnever charged for such work, because we didn't want them to start treating us like actual \\nconsultants, and calling us every time they wanted something changed on their site. We knew \\nwe had to stay a product company, because only that scales.\\n8.

Raising $20,000 from a \\nfirst-time angel investor can be as much work as raising $2 million from a VC fund.\\nTheir lawyers are generally inexperienced too. But while the investors can admit they don't \\nknow what they're doing, their lawyers can't. One YC startup negotiated terms for a tiny round \\nwith an angel, only to receive a 70-page agreement from his lawyer. And since the lawyer could \\nnever admit, in front of his client, that he'd screwed up, he instead had to insist on retaining all \\nthe draconian terms in it, so the deal fell through.\\nOf course, someone has to take money from novice investors, or there would never be any \\nexperienced ones.

Know where you stand.\\nThe most dangerous thing about investors is their indecisiveness. The worst case scenario is \\nthe long no, the no that comes after months of meetings. Rejections from investors are like \\ndesign flaws: inevitable, but much less costly if you discover them early.\\nSo while you're talking to investors, constantly look for signs of where you stand. How likely are \\nthey to offer you a term sheet? What do they have to be convinced of first? You shouldn't \\nnecessarily always be asking these questions outright—that could get annoying—but you \\nshould always be collecting data about them.\\nInvestors tend to resist committing except to the extent you push them to.

If you get through several obstacles and they \\nkeep raising new ones, assume that ultimately they're going to flake.\\nYou have to be disciplined when collecting data about investors' intentions.

Put the most weight on \\nthe second factor. Partly because the most important quality in an investor is simply investing. \\nBut also because, as I mentioned, the biggest factor in investors' opinion of you is other \\ninvestors' opinion of you. If you're talking to several investors and you manage to get one over \\nthe threshold of saying yes, it will make the others much more interested. So you're not \\nsacrificing the lukewarm investors if you focus on the hot ones; convincing the hot investors is \\nthe best way to convince the lukewarm ones.\\nFuture\\nI'm hopeful things won't always be so awkward.

Then you don't depend on any one person.\\nIf you own rental property, there are companies you can hire to manage it for you. Some will do \\neverything, from finding tenants to fixing leaks.

If company management companies existed, there would be an \\nadditional service they could offer clients: they could let them insure their returns by pooling \\ntheir risk.

The simplest way \\nwould be to have a new kind of stock representing the total pool of companies they were \\nmanaging. When you signed up, you'd trade your company's stock for shares of this pool, in \\nproportion to an estimate of your company's value that you'd both agreed upon. Then you'd \\nautomatically get your share of the returns of the whole pool.\\nThe catch is that because this kind of trade would be hard to undo, you couldn't switch \\nmanagement companies.

What I\\'ve just described is an acquisition by a public company.\\n_____\\nUnfortunately, though public acquirers are structurally identical to pooled-risk company \\nmanagement companies, they don\\'t think of themselves that way.

You can sense it when you walk around one. In a hundred \\nsubtle ways, the city sends you a message: you could do more; you should try harder.\\nThe surprising thing is how different these messages can be. New York tells you, above all: you \\nshould make more money. There are other messages too, of course. You should be hipper. You \\nshould be better looking. But the clearest message is that you should be richer.\\nWhat I like about Boston (or rather Cambrid\", \" money. There are other messages too, of course. You should be hipper.

You really should get around to reading all those books you've been meaning to.\\nWhen you ask what message a city sends, you sometimes get surprising answers. As much as \\nthey respect brains in Silicon Valley, the message the Valley sends is: you should be more \\npowerful.\\nThat's not quite the same message New York sends. Power matters in New York too of course, \\nbut New York is pretty impressed by a billion dollars even if you merely inherited it. In Silicon \\nValley no one would care except a few real estate agents. What matters in Silicon Valley is how \\nmuch effect you have on the world.

The reason people there care about Larry and Sergey is not \\ntheir wealth but the fact that they control Google, which affects practically everyone.\\n_____\\nHow much does it matter what message a city sends? Empirically, the answer seems to be: a \\nlot. You might think that if you had enough strength of mind to do great things, you'd be able to \\ntranscend your environment. Where you live should make at most a couple percent difference. \\nBut if you look at the historical evidence, it seems to matter more than that. Most people who \\ndid great things were clumped together in a few places where that sort of thing was done at the \\ntime.\\nYou can see how powerful cities are from something I wrote about earlier: the case of the \\nMilanese Leonardo.

I'm fairly stubborn, but I wouldn't try to fight this force. I'd rather use it. So I've thought a \\nlot about where to live.\\nI'd always imagined Berkeley would be the ideal place — that it would basically be Cambridge \\nwith good weather. But when I finally tried living there a couple years ago, it turned out not to \\nbe. The message Berkeley sends is: you should live better. Life in Berkeley is very civilized.

It's expensive and somewhat grubby, and the weather's often bad. So \\nthe kind of people you find in Cambridge are the kind of people who want to live where the \\nsmartest people are, even if that means living in an expensive, grubby place with bad weather.\\nAs of this writing, Cambridge seems to be the intellectual capital of the world.

The Bay Area has a lot of \\nsmart people too, but again, diluted; there are two great universities, but they're far apart. \\nHarvard and MIT are practically adjacent by West Coast standards, and they're surrounded by \\nabout 20 other colleges and universities. [1]\\nCambridge as a result feels like a town whose main industry is ideas, while New York's is \\nfinance and Silicon Valley's is startups.\\n_____\\nWhen you talk about cities in the sense we are, what you're really talking about is collections of \\npeople.

It's \\njust 178 square miles at one end of it.)\\nMaybe the Internet will change things further. Maybe one day the most important community \\nyou belong to will be a virtual one, and it won't matter where you live physically. But I wouldn't \\nbet on it.

Palo Alto was probably much like Cambridge in 1960, but you'd never \\nguess now that there was a university nearby. Now it's just one of the richer neighborhoods in \\nSilicon Valley. [2]\\nA city speaks to you mostly by accident — in things you see through windows, in conversations \\nyou overhear. It's not something you have to seek out, but something you can't turn off. One of \\nthe occupational hazards of living in Cambridge is overhearing the conversations of people who \\nuse interrogative intonation in declarative sentences.

Now I understand what she meant. The \\nconversations you overhear tell you what sort of people you're among.\\n_____\\nNo matter how determined you are, it's hard not to be influenced by the people around you. It's \\nnot so much that you do whatever a city expects of you, but that you get discouraged when no \\none around you cares about the same things you do.\\nThere's an imbalance between encouragement and discouragement like that between gaining \\nand losing money.

The reason Cambridge is the intellectual capital is \\nnot just that there's a concentration of smart people there, but that there's nothing else people \\nthere care about more.

[3] There's already something else people in New York admire more.\\nIn the long term, that could be a bad thing for New York. The power of an important new \\ntechnology does eventually convert to money. So by caring more about money and less about \\npower than Silicon Valley, New York is recognizing the same thing, but slower.

Only those that are centers for some type of ambition do. And it \\ncan be hard to tell exactly what message a city sends without living there. I understand the \\nmessages of New York, Cambridge, and Silicon Valley because I've lived for several years in \\neach of them. DC and LA seem to send messages too, but I haven't spent long enough in either \\nto say for sure what they are.\\nThe big thing in LA seems to be fame. There's an A List of people who are most in demand \\nright now, and what's most admired is to be on it, or friends with those who are.

And even that \\nis not that different.\\nAt the moment, San Francisco's message seems to be the same as Berkeley's: you should live \\nbetter. But this will change if enough startups choose SF over the Valley. During the Bubble that \\nwas a predictor of failure — a self-indulgent choice, like buying expensive office furniture. Even \\nnow I'm suspicious when startups choose SF.

The message Paris sends now is: do things with style. I \\nliked that, actually. Paris is the only city I've lived in where people genuinely cared about art. In \\nAmerica only a few rich people buy original art, and even the more sophisticated ones rarely \\nget past judging it by the brand name of the artist.

It would have been strong \\n100 years ago, but now I probably wouldn't have picked it up at all if I hadn't deliberately tuned \\nin to that wavelength to see if there was any signal left.\\n_____\\nSo far the complete list of messages I've picked up from cities is: wealth, style, hipness, \\nphysical attractiveness, fame, political power, economic power, intelligence, social class, and \\nquality of life.\\nMy immediate reaction to this list is that it makes me slightly queasy.

It used to mean the control of vast human and material resources.

The new breed are themselves those people.\\nAs this force gets more attention, another is dropping off the list: social class. I think the two \\nchanges are related. Economic power, wealth, and social class are just names for the same \\nthing at different stages in its life: economic power converts to wealth, and wealth to social \\nclass. So the focus of admiration is simply shifting upstream.\\n_____\\nDoes anyone who wants to do great work have to live in a great city?

Most people find it uncomfortable just to sit and do \\nnothing; you avoid work by doing something else.\\nSo one way to beat procrastination is to starve it of distractions. But that's not as straightforward \\nas it sounds, because there are people working hard to distract you. Distraction is not a static \\nobstacle that you avoid like you might avoid a rock in the road. Distraction seeks you out.\\nChesterfield described dirt as matter out of place. Distracting is, similarly, desirable at the wrong \\ntime. And technology is continually being refined to produce more and more desirable things. \\nWhich means that as we learn to avoid one class of distractions, new ones constantly appear,\", \"at the wrong \\ntime. And technology is continually being refined to produce more and more desirable things. \\nWhich means that as we learn to avoid one class of distractions, new ones constantly appear, \\nlike drug-resistant bacteria.\\nTelevision, for example, has after 50 years of refinement reached the point where it's like visual \\ncrack. I realized when I was 13 that TV was addictive, so I stopped watching it. But I read \\nrecently that the average American watches 4 hours of TV a day. A quarter of their life.\\nTV is in decline now, but only because people have found even more addictive ways of wasting \\ntime. And what's especially dangerous is that many happen at your computer. This is no \\naccident. An ever larger percentage of office workers sit in front of computers connected to the \\nInternet, and distractions always evolve toward the procrastinators.\\nI remember when computers were, for me at least, exclusively for work. I might occasionally dial \\nup a server to get mail or ftp files, b\", \"et, and distractions always evolve toward the procrastinators.\\nI remember when computers were, for me at least, exclusively for work. I might occasionally dial \\nup a server to get mail or ftp files, but most of the time I was offline. All I could do was write and \\nprogram. Now I feel as if someone snuck a television onto my desk. Terribly addictive things are \\njust a click away. Run into an obstacle in what you're working on? Hmm, I wonder what's new \\nonline. Better check.\\nAfter years of carefully avoiding classic time sinks like TV, games, and Usenet, I still managed \\nto fall prey to distraction, because I didn't realize that it evolves. Something that used to be safe, \\nusing the Internet, gradually became more and more dangerous. Some days I'd wake up, get a \\ncup of tea and check the news, then check email, then check the news again, then answer a \\nfew emails, then suddenly notice it was almost lunchtime and I hadn't gotten any real work \\ndone. And this started to happen more and mor\", \"s, then check email, then check the news again, then answer a \\nfew emails, then suddenly notice it was almost lunchtime and I hadn't gotten any real work \\ndone. And this started to happen more and more often.\\nIt took me surprisingly long to realize how distracting the Internet had become, because the \\nproblem was intermittent. I ignored it the way you let yourself ignore a bug that only appears \\nintermittently. When I was in the middle of a project, distractions weren't really a problem. It was \\nwhen I'd finished one project and was deciding what to do next that they always bit me.\\nAnother reason it was hard to notice the danger of this new type of distraction was that social \\ncustoms hadn't yet caught up with it. If I'd spent a whole morning sitting on a sofa watching TV, \\nI'd have noticed very quickly. That's a known danger sign, like drinking alone. But using the \\nInternet still looked and felt a lot like work.\\nEventually, though, it became clear that the Internet had become so much\", \"d very quickly. That's a known danger sign, like drinking alone. But using the \\nInternet still looked and felt a lot like work.\\nEventually, though, it became clear that the Internet had become so much more distracting that \\nI had to start treating it differently. Basically, I had to add a new application to my list of known \\ntime sinks: Firefox.\\n* * *\\nThe problem is a hard one to solve because most people still need the Internet for some things. \\nIf you drink too much, you can solve that problem by stopping entirely. But you can't solve the \\nproblem of overeating by stopping eating. I couldn't simply avoid the Internet entirely, as I'd \\ndone with previous time sinks.\\nAt first I tried rules. For example, I'd tell myself I was only going to use the Internet twice a day. \\nBut these schemes never worked for long. Eventually something would come up that required \\nme to use it more than that. And then I'd gradually slip back into my old ways.\\nAddictive things have to be treated as if they we\", \"ver worked for long.

So you have \\nto make it so that you can't merely slip into doing the thing you're trying to avoid. It has to set off \\nalarms.\\nMaybe in the long term the right answer for dealing with Internet distractions will be software \\nthat watches and controls them. But in the meantime I've found a more drastic solution that \\ndefinitely works: to set up a separate computer for using the Internet.\\nI now leave wifi turned off on my main computer except when I need to transfer a file or edit a \\nweb page, and I have a s\", \" that \\ndefinitely works: to set up a separate computer for using the Internet.\\nI now leave wifi turned off on my main computer except when I need to transfer a file or edit a \\nweb page, and I have a separate laptop on the other side of the room that I use to check mail or \\nbrowse the web.

When Steve \\nand Alexis auctioned off their old laptops for charity, I bought them for the Y Combinator \\nmuseum.)\\nMy rule is that I can spend as much time online as I want, as long as I do it on that computer. \\nAnd this turns out to be enough.

I'm not saying we should stop, but I think we should at least \\nexamine which lies we tell and why.\\nThere may also be a benefit to us. We were all lied to as kids, and some of the lies we were told \\nstill affect us. So by studying the ways adults\", ' should at least \\nexamine which lies we tell and why.\\nThere may also be a benefit to us. We were all lied to as kids, and some of the lies we were told \\nstill affect us. So by studying the ways adults lie to kids, we may be able to clear our heads of \\nlies we were told.\\nI\\'m using the word \"lie\" in a very general sense: not just overt falsehoods, but also all the more \\nsubtle ways we mislead kids. Though \"lie\" has negative connotations, I don\\'t mean to suggest \\nwe should never do this—just that we should pay attention when we do. [1]\\nOne of the most remarkable things about the way we lie to kids is how broad the conspiracy is. \\nAll adults know what their culture lies to kids about: they\\'re the questions you answer \"Ask your \\nparents.\" If a kid asked who won the World Series in 1982 or what the atomic weight of carbon \\nwas, you could just tell him. But if a kid asks you \"Is there a God?\" or \"What\\'s a prostitute?\" \\nyou\\'ll probably say \"Ask your parents.\"\\nSince we all agree, kids see few c', 'the atomic weight of carbon \\nwas, you could just tell him. But if a kid asks you \"Is there a God?\" or \"What\\'s a prostitute?\" \\nyou\\'ll probably say \"Ask your parents.\"\\nSince we all agree, kids see few cracks in the view of the world presented to them. The biggest \\ndisagreements are between parents and schools, but even those are small. Schools are careful \\nwhat they say about controversial topics, and if they do contradict what parents want their kids \\nto believe, parents either pressure the school into keeping quiet or move their kids to a new \\nschool.\\nThe conspiracy is so thorough that most kids who discover it do so only by discovering internal \\ncontradictions in what they\\'re told. It can be traumatic for the ones who wake up during the \\noperation. Here\\'s what happened to Einstein: Through the reading of popular scientific books I \\nsoon reached the conviction that much in the stories of the Bible could not be true. The \\nconsequence was a positively fanatic freethinking coupled with th', \"h the reading of popular scientific books I \\nsoon reached the conviction that much in the stories of the Bible could not be true. The \\nconsequence was a positively fanatic freethinking coupled with the impression that youth is \\nintentionally being deceived by the state through lies: it was a crushing impression. [2] I \\nremember that feeling. By 15 I was convinced the world was corrupt from end to end. That's \\nwhy movies like The Matrix have such resonance. Every kid grows up in a fake world. In a way it \\nwould be easier if the forces behind it were as clearly differentiated as a bunch of evil \\nmachines, and one could make a clean break just by taking a pill.\\nProtection\\nIf you ask adults why they lie to kids, the most common reason they give is to protect them. And \\nkids do need protecting. The environment you want to create for a newborn child will be quite \\nunlike the streets of a big city.\\nThat seems so obvious it seems wrong to call it a lie. It's certainly not a bad lie to tell, to\", \" The environment you want to create for a newborn child will be quite \\nunlike the streets of a big city.\\nThat seems so obvious it seems wrong to call it a lie. It's certainly not a bad lie to tell, to give a \\nbaby the impression the world is quiet and warm and safe. But this harmless type of lie can turn \\nsour if left unexamined.\\nImagine if you tried to keep someone in as protected an environment as a newborn till age 18. \\nTo mislead someone so grossly about the world would seem not protection but abuse. That's an \\nextreme example, of course; when parents do that sort of thing it becomes national news. But \\nyou see the same problem on a smaller scale in the malaise teenagers feel in suburbia.\\nThe main purpose of suburbia is to provide a protected environment for children to grow up in. \\nAnd it seems great for 10 year olds. I liked living in suburbia when I was 10. I didn't notice how \\nsterile it was. My whole world was no bigger than a few friends' houses I bicycled to and some \\nwoods \", 'd it seems great for 10 year olds. I liked living in suburbia when I was 10. I didn\\'t notice how \\nsterile it was. My whole world was no bigger than a few friends\\' houses I bicycled to and some \\nwoods I ran around in. On a log scale I was midway between crib and globe. A suburban street \\nwas just the right size. But as I grew older, suburbia started to feel suffocatingly fake.\\nLife can be pretty good at 10 or 20, but it\\'s often frustrating at 15. This is too big a problem to \\nsolve here, but certainly one reason life sucks at 15 is that kids are trapped in a world designed \\nfor 10 year olds.\\nWhat do parents hope to protect their children from by raising them in suburbia? A friend who \\nmoved out of Manhattan said merely that her 3 year old daughter \"saw too much.\" Off the top of \\nmy head, that might include: people who are high or drunk, poverty, madness, gruesome \\nmedical conditions, sexual behavior of various degrees of oddness, and violent anger.\\nI think it\\'s the anger that would worr', \"at might include: people who are high or drunk, poverty, madness, gruesome \\nmedical conditions, sexual behavior of various degrees of oddness, and violent anger.\\nI think it's the anger that would worry me most if I had a 3 year old. I was 29 when I moved to \\nNew York and I was surprised even then. I wouldn't want a 3 year old to see some of the \\ndisputes I saw. It would be too frightening. A lot of the things adults conceal from smaller \\nchildren, they conceal because they'd be frightening, not because they want to conceal the \\nexistence of such things. Misleading the child is just a byproduct.\\nThis seems one of the most justifiable types of lying adults do to kids. But because the lies are \\nindirect we don't keep a very strict accounting of them. Parents know they've concealed the \\nfacts about sex, and many at some point sit their kids down and explain more. But few tell their \\nkids about the differences between the real world and the cocoon they grew up in. Combine this \\nwith the con\", \"about sex, and many at some point sit their kids down and explain more. But few tell their \\nkids about the differences between the real world and the cocoon they grew up in. Combine this \\nwith the confidence parents try to instill in their kids, and every year you get a new crop of 18 \\nyear olds who think they know how to run the world.\\nDon't all 18 year olds think they know how to run the world? Actually this seems to be a recent \\ninnovation, no more than about 100 years old. In preindustrial times teenage kids were junior \\nmembers of the adult world and comparatively well aware of their shortcomings. They could see \\nthey weren't as strong or skillful as the village smith. In past times people lied to kids about \\nsome things more than we do now, but the lies implicit in an artificial, protected environment are \\na recent invention. Like a lot of new inventions, the rich got this first. Children of kings and great \\nmagnates were the first to grow up out of touch with the world. Suburbia\", \"tected environment are \\na recent invention. Like a lot of new inventions, the rich got this first. Children of kings and great \\nmagnates were the first to grow up out of touch with the world. Suburbia means half the \\npopulation can live like kings in that respect.\\nSex (and Drugs)\\nI'd have different worries about raising teenage kids in New York. I'd worry less about what \\nthey'd see, and more about what they'd do. I went to college with a lot of kids who grew up in \\nManhattan, and as a rule they seemed pretty jaded. They seemed to have lost their virginity at \\nan average of about 14 and by college had tried more drugs than I'd even heard of.\\nThe reasons parents don't want their teenage kids having sex are complex. There are some \\nobvious dangers: pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. But those aren't the only \\nreasons parents don't want their kids having sex. The average parents of a 14 year old girl \\nwould hate the idea of her having sex even if there were zero risk of pregnanc\", \". But those aren't the only \\nreasons parents don't want their kids having sex. The average parents of a 14 year old girl \\nwould hate the idea of her having sex even if there were zero risk of pregnancy or sexually \\ntransmitted diseases.\\nKids can probably sense they aren't being told the whole story. After all, pregnancy and sexually \\ntransmitted diseases are just as much a problem for adults, and they have sex.\\nWhat really bothers parents about their teenage kids having sex? Their dislike of the idea is so \\nvisceral it's probably inborn. But if it's inborn it should be universal, and there are plenty of \\nsocieties where parents don't mind if their teenage kids have sex—indeed, where it's normal for \\n14 year olds to become mothers. So what's going on? There does seem to be a universal taboo \\nagainst sex with prepubescent children. One can imagine evolutionary reasons for that. And I \\nthink this is the main reason parents in industrialized societies dislike teenage kids having sex. \\nThey\", \" \\nagainst sex with prepubescent children. One can imagine evolutionary reasons for that. And I \\nthink this is the main reason parents in industrialized societies dislike teenage kids having sex. \\nThey still think of them as children, even though biologically they're not, so the taboo against \\nchild sex still has force.\\nOne thing adults conceal about sex they also conceal about drugs: that it can cause great \\npleasure. That's what makes sex and drugs so dangerous. The desire for them can cloud one's \\njudgement—which is especially frightening when the judgement being clouded is the already \\nwretched judgement of a teenage kid.\\nHere parents' desires conflict. Older societies told kids they had bad judgement, but modern \\nparents want their children to be confident. This may well be a better plan than the old one of \\nputting them in their place, but it has the side effect that after having implicitly lied to kids about \\nhow good their judgement is, we then have to lie again about all the th\", \"an than the old one of \\nputting them in their place, but it has the side effect that after having implicitly lied to kids about \\nhow good their judgement is, we then have to lie again about all the things they might get into \\ntrouble with if they believed us.\\nIf parents told their kids the truth about sex and drugs, it would be: the reason you should avoid \\nthese things is that you have lousy judgement. People with twice your experience still get \\nburned by them. But this may be one of those cases where the truth wouldn't be convincing, \\nbecause one of the symptoms of bad judgement is believing you have good judgement. When \\nyou're too weak to lift something, you can tell, but when you're making a decision impetuously, \\nyou're all the more sure of it.\\nInnocence\\nAnother reason parents don't want their kids having sex is that they want to keep them \\ninnocent. Adults have a certain model of how kids are supposed to behave, and it's different \\nfrom what they expect of other adults.\\nOne of \", \" want their kids having sex is that they want to keep them \\ninnocent. Adults have a certain model of how kids are supposed to behave, and it's different \\nfrom what they expect of other adults.\\nOne of the most obvious differences is the words kids are allowed to use. Most parents use \\nwords when talking to other adults that they wouldn't want their kids using. They try to hide even \\nthe existence of these words for as long as they can. And this is another of those conspiracies \\neveryone participates in: everyone knows you're not supposed to swear in front of kids.\\nI've never heard more different explanations for anything parents tell kids than why they \\nshouldn't swear. Every parent I know forbids their children to swear, and yet no two of them \\nhave the same justification. It's clear most start with not wanting kids to swear, then make up \\nthe reason afterward.\\nSo my theory about what's going on is that the function of swearwords is to mark the speaker \\nas an adult. There's no differen\", 'start with not wanting kids to swear, then make up \\nthe reason afterward.\\nSo my theory about what\\'s going on is that the function of swearwords is to mark the speaker \\nas an adult. There\\'s no difference in the meaning of \"shit\" and \"poopoo.\" So why should one be \\nok for kids to say and one forbidden? The only explanation is: by definition. [3]\\nWhy does it bother adults so much when kids do things reserved for adults? The idea of a foul-\\nmouthed, cynical 10 year old leaning against a lamppost with a cigarette hanging out of the \\ncorner of his mouth is very disconcerting. But why?\\nOne reason we want kids to be innocent is that we\\'re programmed to like certain kinds of \\nhelplessness. I\\'ve several times heard mothers say they deliberately refrained from correcting \\ntheir young children\\'s mispronunciations because they were so cute. And if you think about it, \\ncuteness is helplessness. Toys and cartoon characters meant to be cute always have clueless \\nexpressions and stubby, ineffectual lim', \"onunciations because they were so cute. And if you think about it, \\ncuteness is helplessness. Toys and cartoon characters meant to be cute always have clueless \\nexpressions and stubby, ineffectual limbs.\\nIt's not surprising we'd have an inborn desire to love and protect helpless creatures, considering \\nhuman offspring are so helpless for so long. Without the helplessness that makes kids cute, \\nthey'd be very annoying. They'd merely seem like incompetent adults. But there's more to it than \\nthat. The reason our hypothetical jaded 10 year old bothers me so much is not just that he'd be \\nannoying, but that he'd have cut off his prospects for growth so early. To be jaded you have to \\nthink you know how the world works, and any theory a 10 year old had about that would \\nprobably be a pretty narrow one.\\nInnocence is also open-mindedness. We want kids to be innocent so they can continue to learn. \\nParadoxical as it sounds, there are some kinds of knowledge that get in the way of other kinds \\n\", \"row one.\\nInnocence is also open-mindedness. We want kids to be innocent so they can continue to learn. \\nParadoxical as it sounds, there are some kinds of knowledge that get in the way of other kinds \\nof knowledge. If you're going to learn that the world is a brutal place full of people trying to take \\nadvantage of one another, you're better off learning it last. Otherwise you won't bother learning \\nmuch more.\\nVery smart adults often seem unusually innocent, and I don't think this is a coincidence. I think \\nthey've deliberately avoided learning about certain things. Certainly I do. I used to think I wanted \\nto know everything. Now I know I don't.\\nDeath\\nAfter sex, death is the topic adults lie most conspicuously about to kids. Sex I believe they \\nconceal because of deep taboos. But why do we conceal death from kids? Probably because \\nsmall children are particularly horrified by it. They want to feel safe, and death is the ultimate \\nthreat.\\nOne of the most spectacular lies our parents tol\", ' conceal death from kids? Probably because \\nsmall children are particularly horrified by it. They want to feel safe, and death is the ultimate \\nthreat.\\nOne of the most spectacular lies our parents told us was about the death of our first cat. Over \\nthe years, as we asked for more details, they were compelled to invent more, so the story grew \\nquite elaborate. The cat had died at the vet\\'s office. Of what? Of the anaesthesia itself. Why was \\nthe cat at the vet\\'s office? To be fixed. And why had such a routine operation killed it? It wasn\\'t \\nthe vet\\'s fault; the cat had a congenitally weak heart; the anaesthesia was too much for it; but \\nthere was no way anyone could have known this in advance. It was not till we were in our \\ntwenties that the truth came out: my sister, then about three, had accidentally stepped on the \\ncat and broken its back.\\nThey didn\\'t feel the need to tell us the cat was now happily in cat heaven. My parents never \\nclaimed that people or animals who died had \"gone t', ' accidentally stepped on the \\ncat and broken its back.\\nThey didn\\'t feel the need to tell us the cat was now happily in cat heaven. My parents never \\nclaimed that people or animals who died had \"gone to a better place,\" or that we\\'d meet them \\nagain. It didn\\'t seem to harm us.\\nMy grandmother told us an edited version of the death of my grandfather. She said they\\'d been \\nsitting reading one day, and when she said something to him, he didn\\'t answer. He seemed to \\nbe asleep, but when she tried to rouse him, she couldn\\'t. \"He was gone.\" Having a heart attack \\nsounded like falling asleep. Later I learned it hadn\\'t been so neat, and the heart attack had \\ntaken most of a day to kill him.\\nAlong with such outright lies, there must have been a lot of changing the subject when death \\ncame up. I can\\'t remember that, of course, but I can infer it from the fact that I didn\\'t really grasp \\nI was going to die till I was about 19. How could I have missed something so obvious for so \\nlong? Now that I\\'ve ', \"remember that, of course, but I can infer it from the fact that I didn't really grasp \\nI was going to die till I was about 19. How could I have missed something so obvious for so \\nlong? Now that I've seen parents managing the subject, I can see how: questions about death \\nare gently but firmly turned aside.\\nOn this topic, especially, they're met half-way by kids. Kids often want to be lied to. They want to \\nbelieve they're living in a comfortable, safe world as much as their parents want them to believe \\nit. [4]\\nIdentity\\nSome parents feel a strong adherence to an ethnic or religious group and want their kids to feel \\nit too. This usually requires two different kinds of lying: the first is to tell the child that he or she \\nis an X, and the second is whatever specific lies Xes differentiate themselves by believing. [5]\\nTelling a child they have a particular ethnic or religious identity is one of the stickiest things you \\ncan tell them. Almost anything else you tell a kid, they can change\", 'themselves by believing. [5]\\nTelling a child they have a particular ethnic or religious identity is one of the stickiest things you \\ncan tell them. Almost anything else you tell a kid, they can change their mind about later when \\nthey start to think for themselves. But if you tell a kid they\\'re a member of a certain group, that \\nseems nearly impossible to shake.\\nThis despite the fact that it can be one of the most premeditated lies parents tell. When parents \\nare of different religions, they\\'ll often agree between themselves that their children will be \\n\"raised as Xes.\" And it works. The kids obligingly grow up considering themselves as Xes, \\ndespite the fact that if their parents had chosen the other way, they\\'d have grown up considering \\nthemselves as Ys.\\nOne reason this works so well is the second kind of lie involved. The truth is common property. \\nYou can\\'t distinguish your group by doing things that are rational, and believing things that are \\ntrue. If you want to set yourself ap', ' the second kind of lie involved. The truth is common property. \\nYou can\\'t distinguish your group by doing things that are rational, and believing things that are \\ntrue. If you want to set yourself apart from other people, you have to do things that are arbitrary, \\nand believe things that are false. And after having spent their whole lives doing things that are \\narbitrary and believing things that are false, and being regarded as odd by \"outsiders\" on that \\naccount, the cognitive dissonance pushing children to regard themselves as Xes must be \\nenormous. If they aren\\'t an X, why are they attached to all these arbitrary beliefs and customs? \\nIf they aren\\'t an X, why do all the non-Xes call them one?\\nThis form of lie is not without its uses. You can use it to carry a payload of beneficial beliefs, and \\nthey will also become part of the child\\'s identity. You can tell the child that in addition to never \\nwearing the color yellow, believing the world was created by a giant rabbit, and always', \"iefs, and \\nthey will also become part of the child's identity. You can tell the child that in addition to never \\nwearing the color yellow, believing the world was created by a giant rabbit, and always snapping \\ntheir fingers before eating fish, Xes are also particularly honest and industrious. Then X children \\nwill grow up feeling it's part of their identity to be honest and industrious.\\nThis probably accounts for a lot of the spread of modern religions, and explains why their \\ndoctrines are a combination of the useful and the bizarre. The bizarre half is what makes the \\nreligion stick, and the useful half is the payload. [6]\\nAuthority\\nOne of the least excusable reasons adults lie to kids is to maintain power over them. \\nSometimes these lies are truly sinister, like a child molester telling his victims they'll get in \\ntrouble if they tell anyone what happened to them. Others seem more innocent; it depends how \\nbadly adults lie to maintain their power, and what they use it for.\\nMost adu\", 'g his victims they\\'ll get in \\ntrouble if they tell anyone what happened to them. Others seem more innocent; it depends how \\nbadly adults lie to maintain their power, and what they use it for.\\nMost adults make some effort to conceal their flaws from children. Usually their motives are \\nmixed. For example, a father who has an affair generally conceals it from his children. His \\nmotive is partly that it would worry them, partly that this would introduce the topic of sex, and \\npartly (a larger part than he would admit) that he doesn\\'t want to tarnish himself in their eyes.\\nIf you want to learn what lies are told to kids, read almost any book written to teach them about \\n\"issues.\" [7] Peter Mayle wrote one called Why Are We Getting a Divorce? It begins with the \\nthree most important things to remember about divorce, one of which is: You shouldn\\'t put the \\nblame on one parent, because divorce is never only one person\\'s fault. [8] Really? When a man \\nruns off with his secretary, is it always ', 'emember about divorce, one of which is: You shouldn\\'t put the \\nblame on one parent, because divorce is never only one person\\'s fault. [8] Really? When a man \\nruns off with his secretary, is it always partly his wife\\'s fault? But I can see why Mayle might \\nhave said this. Maybe it\\'s more important for kids to respect their parents than to know the truth \\nabout them.\\nBut because adults conceal their flaws, and at the same time insist on high standards of \\nbehavior for kids, a lot of kids grow up feeling they fall hopelessly short.

When I protested that the teacher had said the \\nopposite, my father replied that the guy had no idea what he was talking about—that he was \\njust an elementary school teacher, after all.\\nJust a teacher?

The most excusable are those told to \\nsimplify ideas to make them easy to learn. The problem is, a lot of propaganda gets slipped into \\nthe curriculum in the name of simplification.\\nPublic school textbooks represent a compromise between what various powerful groups want \\nkids to be told.

By the time you got to politics and recent \\nhistory, what we were taught was pretty much pure propaganda. For example, we were taught \\nto regard political leaders as saints—especially the recently martyred Kennedy and King. It was \\nastonishing to learn later that they'd both been serial womanizers, and that Kennedy was a \\nspeed freak to boot. (By the time King's plagiarism emerged, I'd lost the ability to be surprised \\nby the misdeeds of famous people.)\\nI doubt you could teach kids recent history without teaching them lies, because practically \\neveryone who has anything to say about it has some kind of spin to put on it.

Kids, almost by definition, lack self-control. They react violently to things—\\nand so they get lied to a lot.

And that (phew) was the \\nend of that.\\nWhenever we lie to kids to protect them, we're usually also lying to keep the peace.\\nOne consequence of this sort of calming lie is that we grow up thinking horrible things are \\nnormal. It's hard for us to feel a sense of urgency as adults over something we've literally been \\ntrained not to worry about.

These range from \"make-believe,\" which is not \\nreally a lie because it\\'s told with a wink, to the frightening lies told by older siblings.

In fact the less \\neducated parents seem closer to the truth.\\n[4] As a friend with small children pointed out, it\\'s easy for small children to consider themselves immortal, because \\ntime seems to pass so slowly for them.

We've learned a lot since then, but if I were choosing now \\nthat's still the one I'd pick.\\nAnother thing we tell founders is not to worry too much about the business model, at least at \\nfirst. Not because making money is unimportant, but because it's so much easier than building \\nsomething great.\\nA couple weeks ago I realized that if you\", \"oo much about the business model, at least at \\nfirst.

What \\nyou've got is a description of a charity.\\nWhen you get an unexpected result like this, it could either be a bug or a new discovery. Either \\nbusinesses aren't supposed to be like charities, and we've proven by reductio ad absurdum that \\none or both of the principles we began with is false. Or we have a new idea.\\nI suspect it's the latter, because as soon as this thought occurred to me, a whole bunch of other \\nthings fell into place.\\nExamples\\nFor example, Craigslist. It's not a charity, but they run it like one. And they're astoundingly \\nsuccessful.

If you're \\nupwind, you decide when and if to engage the other ship. Craigslist is effectively upwind of \\nenormous revenues. They'd face some challenges if they wanted to make more, but not the sort \\nyou face when you're tacking upwind, trying to force a crappy product on ambivalent users by \\nspending ten times as much on sales as on development. [1]\\nI'm not saying startups should aim to end up like Craigslist. They're a product of unusual \\ncircumstances. But they're a good model for the early phases.\\nGoogle looked a lot like a charity in the beginning. They didn't have ads for over a year.\", \" like Craigslist.

At year \\n1, Google was indistinguishable from a nonprofit. If a nonprofit or government organization had \\nstarted a project to index the web, Google at year 1 is the limit of what they'd have produced.\\nBack when I was working on spam filters I thought it would be a good idea to have a web-based \\nemail service with good spam filtering. I wasn't thinking of it as a company. I just wanted to keep \\npeople from getting spammed. But as I thought more about this project, I realized it would \\nprobably have to be a company. It would cost something to run, and it would be a pain to fund \\nwith grants and donations.\\nThat was a surprising realization.

But if someone had, they'd probably be \\nquite rich now. There was a window of about two years when spam was increasing rapidly but \\nall the big email services had terrible filters. If someone had launched a new, spam-free mail \\nservice, users would have flocked to it.\\nNotice the pattern here? From either direction we get to the same spot. If you start from \\nsuccessful startups, you find they often behaved like nonprofits. And if you start from ideas for \\nnonprofits, you find they'd often make good startups.\\nPower\\nHow wide is this territory? Would all good nonprofits be good companies? Possibly not.

Possibly not. What \\nmakes Google so valuable is that their users have money. If you make people with money love \\nyou, you can probably get some of it. But could you also base a successful startup on behaving \\nlike a nonprofit to people who don't have money? Could you, for example, grow a successful \\nstartup out of curing an unfashionable but deadly disease like malaria?\\nI'm not sure, but I suspect that if you pushed this idea, you'd be surprised how far it would go. \\nFor example, people who apply to Y Combinator don't generally have much money, and yet we \\ncan profit by helping them, because with our help they could make money. Maybe the situation \\nis similar with malaria. Maybe an organization that helped lift its weight off a country could \\nbenefit from the resulting growth.\\nI'm not proposing this is a serious idea.

I don't know anything about malaria. But I've been \\nkicking ideas around long enough to know when I come across a powerful one.\\nOne way to guess how far an idea extends is to ask yourself at what point you'd bet against it. \\nThe thought of betting against benevolence is alarming in the same way as saying that \\nsomething is technically impossible. You're just asking to be made a fool of, because these are \\nsuch powerful forces. [2]\\nFor example, initially I thought maybe this principle only applied to Internet startups. Obviously it \\nworked for Google, but what about Microsoft? Surely Microsoft isn't benevolent? But when I \\nthink back to the beginning, they were. Compared to IBM they were like Robin Hood.

It's the sort of thing you'd expect Google to do.\\nMicrosoft isn't so benevolent now. Now when one thinks of what Microsoft does to users, all the \\nverbs that come to mind begin with F.

Could \\nthere be a connection?\\nYou can see how there would be. When you're small, you can't bully customers, so you have to \\ncharm them.

So \\n\"Don\\'t be evil\" may be the most valuable thing Paul Buchheit made for Google, because it may \\nturn out to be an elixir of corporate youth. I\\'m sure they find it constraining, but think how \\nvaluable it will be if it saves them from lapsing into the fatal laziness that afflicted Microsoft and \\nIBM.\\nThe curious thing is, this elixir is freely available to any other company. Anyone can adopt \"Don\\'t \\nbe evil.\" The catch is that people will hold you to it. So I don\\'t think you\\'re going to see record \\nlabels or tobacco companies using this discovery.\\nMorale\\nThere\\'s a lot of external evidence that benevolence works. But how does it work?

But how does it work? One \\nadvantage of investing in a large number of startups is that you get a lot of data about how they \\nwork. From what we've seen, being good seems to help startups in three ways: it improves their \\nmorale, it makes other people want to help them, and above all, it helps them be decisive.\\nMorale is tremendously important to a startup—so important that morale alone is almost \\nenough to determine success. Startups are often described as emotional roller-coasters. One \\nminute you're going to take over the world, and the next you're doomed. The problem with \\nfeeling you're doomed is not just that it makes you unhappy, but that it makes you stop working. \\nSo the downhills of the roller-coaster are more of a self fulfilling prophecy than the uphills. If \\nfeeling you're going to succeed makes you work harder, that probably improves your chances of \\nsucceeding, but if feeling you're going to f\", \"are more of a self fulfilling prophecy than the uphills. If \\nfeeling you're going to succeed makes you work harder, that probably improves your chances of \\nsucceeding, but if feeling you're going to fail makes you stop working, that practically \\nguarantees you'll fail.\\nHere's where benevolence comes in. If you feel you're really helping people, you'll keep working \\neven when it seems like your startup is doomed. Most of us have some amount of natural \\nbenevolence. The mere fact that someone needs you makes you want to help them. So if you \\nstart the kind of startup where users come back each day, you've basically built yourself a giant \\ntamagotchi. You've made something you need to take care of.\\nBlogger is a famous example of a startup that went through really low lows and survived. At one \\npoint they ran out of money and everyone left. Evan Williams came in to work the next day, and \\nthere was no one but him. What kept him going? Partly that users needed him. He was hosting \\nthousands\", \" \\npoint they ran out of money and everyone left. Evan Williams came in to work the next day, and \\nthere was no one but him. What kept him going? Partly that users needed him. He was hosting \\nthousands of people's blogs. He couldn't just let the site die.\\nThere are many advantages of launching quickly, but the most important may be that once you \\nhave users, the tamagotchi effect kicks in. Once you have users to take care of, you're forced to \\nfigure out what will make them happy, and that's actually very valuable information.\\nThe added confidence that comes from trying to help people can also help you with investors. \\nOne of the founders of Chatterous told me recently that he and his cofounder had decided that \\nthis service was something the world needed, so they were going to keep working on it no \\nmatter what, even if they had to move back to Canada and live in their parents' basements.\\nOnce they realized this, they stopped caring so much what investors thought about them. They \\nstil\", \" on it no \\nmatter what, even if they had to move back to Canada and live in their parents' basements.\\nOnce they realized this, they stopped caring so much what investors thought about them. They \\nstill met with them, but they weren't going to die if they didn't get their money. And you know \\nwhat? The investors got a lot more interested. They could sense that the Chatterouses were \\ngoing to do this startup with or without them.\\nIf you're really committed and your startup is cheap to run, you become very hard to kill. And \\npractically all startups, even the most successful, come close to death at some point. So if \\ndoing good for people gives you a sense of mission that makes you harder to kill, that alone \\nmore than compensates for whatever you lose by not choosing a more selfish project.\\nHelp\\nAnother advantage of being good is that it makes other people want to help you.

They can work wherever they \\nwant. So most want to work on things that will make the world better.\\nCompass\\nBut the most important advantage of being good is that it acts as a compass.

If you're a good salesman, you could try to just talk them into it. But the more \\nreliable route is to convince them through your users: if you make something users love enough \\nto tell their friends, you grow exponentially, and that will convince any investor.\\nBeing good is a particularly useful strategy for making decisions in complex situations because \\nit's stateless. It's like telling the truth. The trouble with lying is that you have to remember \\neverything you've said in the past to make sure you don't contradict yourself. If you tell the truth \\nyou don't have to remember anything, and that's a really useful property in domains where \\nthings happen fast.\\nFor example, Y Combinator ha\", \"e sure you don't contradict yourself. If you tell the truth \\nyou don't have to remember anything, and that's a really useful property in domains where \\nthings happen fast.\\nFor example, Y Combinator has now invested in 80 startups, 57 of which are still alive. (The rest \\nhave died or merged or been acquired.) When you're trying to advise 57 startups, it turns out \\nyou have to have a stateless algorithm. You can't have ulterior motives when you have 57 things \\ngoing on at once, because you can't remember them. So our rule is just to do whatever's best \\nfor the founders. Not because we're particularly benevolent, but because it's the only algorithm \\nthat works on that scale.\\nWhen you write something telling people to be good, you seem to be claiming to be good \\nyourself.

They would have sold, but Yahoo blew it by offering too little.\\nTip for acquirers: when a startup turns you down, consider raising your offer, because there's a \\ngood chance the outrageous price they want will later seem a bargain. [1]\\nFrom the evidence I've seen so far, startups that turn down acquisition offers usually end up \\ndoing better. Not always, but usually there's a bigger offer coming, or perhaps even an IPO.\\nOf course, the reason startups do better when they turn down acquisition offers is not \\nnecessarily that all such offers undervalue startups.

Curiously enough, it's the same reason \\nGoogle and Facebook have remained independent: money guys undervalue the most \\ninnovative startups.\\nThe reason there aren't more Googles is not that investors encourage innovative startups to sell \\nout, but that they won't even fund them. I've learned a lot about VCs during the 3 years we've \\nbeen doing Y Combinator, because we often have to work quite closely with them. The most \\nsurprising thing I've learned is how conservative they are. VC firms present an image of boldly \\nencouraging innovation. Only a handful actually do, and even they are more conservative in \\nreality than you'd guess from reading their sites.\\nI used to think of VCs as piratical: bold but unscrupulous. On closer acquaintance they turn out \\nto be more like bureaucrats. They're more upstanding than I used to think (the good ones, at \\nleast), but less bold. Maybe the VC industry has changed.

The low cost of starting a startup \\nmeans the average good bet is a riskier one, but most existing VC firms still operate as if they \\nwere investing in hardware startups in 1985.\\nHoward Aiken said \"Don\\'t worry about people stealing your ideas. If your ideas are any good, \\nyou\\'ll have to ram them down people\\'s throats.\" I have a similar feeling when I\\'m trying to \\nconvince VCs to invest in startups Y Combinator has funded. They\\'re terrified of really novel \\nideas, unless the founders are good enough salesmen to compensate.\\nBut it\\'s the bold ideas that generate the biggest returns. Any really good new idea will seem bad \\nto most people; otherwise someone would already be doing it. And yet most VCs are driven by \\nconsensus, not just within their firms, but wit', 'he biggest returns. Any really good new idea will seem bad \\nto most people; otherwise someone would already be doing it. And yet most VCs are driven by \\nconsensus, not just within their firms, but within the VC community. The biggest factor \\ndetermining how a VC will feel about your startup is how other VCs feel about it. I doubt they \\nrealize it, but this algorithm guarantees they\\'ll miss all the very best ideas. The more people \\nwho have to like a new idea, the more outliers you lose.\\nWhoever the next Google is, they\\'re probably being told right now by VCs to come back when \\nthey have more \"traction.\"\\nWhy are VCs so conservative? It\\'s probably a combination of factors. The large size of their \\ninvestments makes them conservative. Plus they\\'re investing other people\\'s money, which \\nmakes them worry they\\'ll get in trouble if they do something risky and it fails.

Plus most of them \\nare money guys rather than technical guys, so they don't understand what the startups they're \\ninvesting in do.\\nWhat's Next\\nThe exciting thing about market economies is that stupidity equals opportunity. And so it is in \\nthis case. There is a huge, unexploited opportunity in startup investing. Y Combinator funds \\nstartups at the very beginning. VCs will fund them once they're already starting to succeed. But \\nbetween the two there is a substantial gap.\\nThere are companies that will give $20k to a startup that has nothing more than the founders, \\nand there are companies that will give $2 million to a startup that's already taking off, but there \\naren't enough investors who will give $200k to a startup that seems very promising but still has \\nsome things to figure out.

This territory is occupied mostly by individual angel investors—people \\nlike Andy Bechtolsheim, who gave Google $100k when they seemed promising but still had \\nsome things to figure out. I like angels, but there just aren't enough of them, and investing is for \\nmost of them a part time job.\\nAnd yet as it gets cheaper to start startups, this sparsely occupied territory is becoming more \\nand more valuable. Nowadays a lot of startups don't want to raise multi-million dollar series A \\nrounds. They don't need that much money, and they don't want the hassles that come with it. \\nThe median startup coming out of Y Combinator wants to raise $250-500k. When they go to VC \\nfirms they have to ask for more because they know VCs aren't interested in such small deals.\\nVCs are money managers. They're looking for ways to put large sums to work.

That means they want less money, but also that there are more \\nof them. So you can still get large returns on large amounts of money; you just have to spread it \\nmore broadly.\\nI've tried to explain this to VC firms. Instead of making one $2 million investment, make five \\n$400k investments. Would that mean sitting on too many boards? Don't sit on their boards. \\nWould that mean too much due diligence? Do less. If you're investing at a tenth the valuation, \\nyou only have to be a tenth as sure.\\nIt seems obvious.

Either VCs \\nwill evolve down into this gap or, more likely, new investors will appear to fill it.

Twenty years ago, writers wrote and readers \\nread. The web lets readers respond, and increasingly they do—in comment threads, on forums, \\nand in their own blog posts.\\nMany who respond to something disagree with it. That's to be expected. Agreeing tends to \\nmotivate people less than disagreeing. And when you agree there's less to say. You could \\nexpand on something the author said, but he has probably already explored the most \\ninteresting implications. When you disagree you're entering territory he may not have explored.\\nThe result is there's a lot more disagreeing going on, especially measured by the word. That \\ndoesn't mean people are getting angrier. The structural change in the way we communicate is \\nenough to account for it. But though it's not anger that's driving the increase in disagreement, \\nthere's a danger that the increase in disagreement will make people angrier. Particularly online, \\nwhe\", 'enough to account for it. But though it\\'s not anger that\\'s driving the increase in disagreement, \\nthere\\'s a danger that the increase in disagreement will make people angrier. Particularly online, \\nwhere it\\'s easy to say things you\\'d never say face to face.\\nIf we\\'re all going to be disagreeing more, we should be careful to do it well. What does it mean \\nto disagree well? Most readers can tell the difference between mere name-calling and a \\ncarefully reasoned refutation, but I think it would help to put names on the intermediate stages. \\nSo here\\'s an attempt at a disagreement hierarchy:\\nDH0. Name-calling.\\nThis is the lowest form of disagreement, and probably also the most common. We\\'ve all seen \\ncomments like this: u r a fag!!!!!!!!!! But it\\'s important to realize that more articulate name-calling \\nhas just as little weight. A comment like The author is a self-important dilettante. is really \\nnothing more than a pretentious version of \"u r a fag.\"\\nDH1. Ad Hominem.\\nAn ad hominem attack is', 'alling \\nhas just as little weight. A comment like The author is a self-important dilettante. is really \\nnothing more than a pretentious version of \"u r a fag.\"\\nDH1. Ad Hominem.\\nAn ad hominem attack is not quite as weak as mere name-calling. It might actually carry some \\nweight. For example, if a senator wrote an article saying senators\\' salaries should be increased, \\none could respond: Of course he would say that. He\\'s a senator. This wouldn\\'t refute the \\nauthor\\'s argument, but it may at least be relevant to the case. It\\'s still a very weak form of \\ndisagreement, though. If there\\'s something wrong with the senator\\'s argument, you should say \\nwhat it is; and if there isn\\'t, what difference does it make that he\\'s a senator?\\nSaying that an author lacks the authority to write about a topic is a variant of ad hominem—and \\na particularly useless sort, because good ideas often come from outsiders. The question is \\nwhether the author is correct or not. If his lack of authority caused him to ma', \"a variant of ad hominem—and \\na particularly useless sort, because good ideas often come from outsiders. The question is \\nwhether the author is correct or not. If his lack of authority caused him to make mistakes, point \\nthose out. And if it didn't, it's not a problem.\\nDH2. Responding to Tone.\\nThe next level up we start to see responses to the writing, rather than the writer. The lowest \\nform of these is to disagree with the author's tone. E.g. I can't believe the author dismisses \\nintelligent design in such a cavalier fashion. Though better than attacking the author, this is still \\na weak form of disagreement. It matters much more whether the author is wrong or right than \\nwhat his tone is. Especially since tone is so hard to judge. Someone who has a chip on their \\nshoulder about some topic might be offended by a tone that to other readers seemed neutral.\\nSo if the worst thing you can say about something is to criticize its tone, you're not saying much. \\nIs the author flippant, but cor\", \"c might be offended by a tone that to other readers seemed neutral.\\nSo if the worst thing you can say about something is to criticize its tone, you're not saying much. \\nIs the author flippant, but correct? Better that than grave and wrong. And if the author is \\nincorrect somewhere, say where.\\nDH3. Contradiction.\\nIn this stage we finally get responses to what was said, rather than how or by whom. The lowest \\nform of response to an argument is simply to state the opposing case, with little or no \\nsupporting evidence.\\nThis is often combined with DH2 statements, as in: I can't believe the author dismisses \\nintelligent design in such a cavalier fashion. Intelligent design is a legitimate scientific theory. \\nContradiction can sometimes have some weight. Sometimes merely seeing the opposing case \\nstated explicitly is enough to see that it's right. But usually evidence will help.\\nDH4. Counterargument.\\nAt level 4 we reach the first form of convincing disagreement: counterargument. Forms up to \\n\", \"\\nstated explicitly is enough to see that it's right. But usually evidence will help.\\nDH4. Counterargument.\\nAt level 4 we reach the first form of convincing disagreement: counterargument. Forms up to \\nthis point can usually be ignored as proving nothing. Counterargument might prove something. \\nThe problem is, it's hard to say exactly what.\\nCounterargument is contradiction plus reasoning and/or evidence. When aimed squarely at the \\noriginal argument, it can be convincing. But unfortunately it's common for counterarguments to \\nbe aimed at something slightly different. More often than not, two people arguing passionately \\nabout something are actually arguing about two different things. Sometimes they even agree \\nwith one another, but are so caught up in their squabble they don't realize it.\\nThere could be a legitimate reason for arguing against something slightly different from what \\nthe original author said: when you feel they missed the heart of the matter. But when you do \\nthat, you sho\", 'ere could be a legitimate reason for arguing against something slightly different from what \\nthe original author said: when you feel they missed the heart of the matter. But when you do \\nthat, you should say explicitly you\\'re doing it.\\nDH5. Refutation.\\nThe most convincing form of disagreement is refutation. It\\'s also the rarest, because it\\'s the \\nmost work. Indeed, the disagreement hierarchy forms a kind of pyramid, in the sense that the \\nhigher you go the fewer instances you find.\\nTo refute someone you probably have to quote them. You have to find a \"smoking gun,\" a \\npassage in whatever you disagree with that you feel is mistaken, and then explain why it\\'s \\nmistaken. If you can\\'t find an actual quote to disagree with, you may be arguing with a straw \\nman.\\nWhile refutation generally entails quoting, quoting doesn\\'t necessarily imply refutation. Some \\nwriters quote parts of things they disagree with to give the appearance of legitimate refutation, \\nthen follow with a response as low as ', \"s quoting, quoting doesn't necessarily imply refutation. Some \\nwriters quote parts of things they disagree with to give the appearance of legitimate refutation, \\nthen follow with a response as low as DH3 or even DH0.\\nDH6. Refuting the Central Point.\\nThe force of a refutation depends on what you refute. The most powerful form of disagreement \\nis to refute someone's central point.\\nEven as high as DH5 we still sometimes see deliberate dishonesty, as when someone picks out \\nminor points of an argument and refutes those. Sometimes the spirit in which this is done \\nmakes it more of a sophisticated form of ad hominem than actual refutation. For example, \\ncorrecting someone's grammar, or harping on minor mistakes in names or numbers. Unless the \\nopposing argument actually depends on such things, the only purpose of correcting them is to \\ndiscredit one's opponent.\\nTruly refuting something requires one to refute its central point, or at least one of them. And that \\nmeans one has to commit explic\", \"he only purpose of correcting them is to \\ndiscredit one's opponent.\\nTruly refuting something requires one to refute its central point, or at least one of them. And that \\nmeans one has to commit explicitly to what the central point is. So a truly effective refutation \\nwould look like: The author's main point seems to be x. As he says: <quotation> But this is \\nwrong for the following reasons... The quotation you point out as mistaken need not be the \\nactual statement of the author's main point. It's enough to refute something it depends upon.\\nWhat It Means\\nNow we have a way of classifying forms of disagreement. What good is it? One thing the \\ndisagreement hierarchy doesn't give us is a way of picking a winner. DH levels merely describe \\nthe form of a statement, not whether it's correct. A DH6 response could still be completely \\nmistaken.\\nBut while DH levels don't set a lower bound on the convincingness of a reply, they do set an \\nupper bound. A DH6 response might be unconvincing, but a D\", \"6 response could still be completely \\nmistaken.\\nBut while DH levels don't set a lower bound on the convincingness of a reply, they do set an \\nupper bound. A DH6 response might be unconvincing, but a DH2 or lower response is always \\nunconvincing.\\nThe most obvious advantage of classifying the forms of disagreement is that it will help people \\nto evaluate what they read. In particular, it will help them to see through intellectually dishonest \\narguments. An eloquent speaker or writer can give the impression of vanquishing an opponent \\nmerely by using forceful words. In fact that is probably the defining quality of a demagogue. By \\ngiving names to the different forms of disagreement, we give critical readers a pin for popping \\nsuch balloons.\\nSuch labels may help writers too. Most intellectual dishonesty is unintentional. Someone \\narguing against the tone of something he disagrees with may believe he's really saying \\nsomething. Zooming out and seeing his current position on the disagreement\", \"dishonesty is unintentional. Someone \\narguing against the tone of something he disagrees with may believe he's really saying \\nsomething. Zooming out and seeing his current position on the disagreement hierarchy may \\ninspire him to try moving up to counterargument or refutation.\\nBut the greatest benefit of disagreeing well is not just that it will make conversations better, but \\nthat it will make the people who have them happier. If you study conversations, you find there is \\na lot more meanness down in DH1 than up in DH6. You don't have to be mean when you have \\na real point to make. In fact, you don't want to. If you have something real to say, being mean \\njust gets in the way.\\nIf moving up the disagreement hierarchy makes people less mean, that will make most of them \\nhappier. Most people don't really enjoy being mean; they do it because they can't help it.\\nThanks to Trevor Blackwell and Jessica Livingston for reading drafts of this.\\nRelated:\\nYou Weren-t Meant to Have a Boss - # 88\\n \", \"e don't really enjoy being mean; they do it because they can't help it.\\nThanks to Trevor Blackwell and Jessica Livingston for reading drafts of this.\\nRelated:\\nYou Weren-t Meant to Have a Boss - # 88\\n Want to start a startup?

I've now \\nworked with over 200 of them, and I've noticed a definite difference between programmers \\nworking on their own startups and those working for large organizations.

It \\nwas remarkable how different they seemed. Particularly lions. Lions in the wild seem about ten \\ntimes more alive. They're like different animals. I suspect that working for oneself feels better to \\nhumans in much the same way that living in the wild must feel better to a wide-ranging predator \\nlike a lion. Life in a zoo is easier, but it isn't the life they were designed for.\\nTrees\\nWhat's so unnatural about working for a big company?

The root of the problem is that humans \\nweren't meant to work in such large groups.\\nAnother thing you notice when you see animals in the wild is that each species thrives in \\ngroups of a certain size. A herd of impalas might have 100 adults; baboons maybe 20; lions \\nrarely 10. Humans also seem designed to work in groups, and what I've read about hunter-\\ngatherers accords with research on organizations and my own experience to suggest roughly \\nwhat the ideal size is: groups of 8 work well; by 20 they're getting hard to manage; and a group \\nof 50 is really unwieldy.

But when you use this trick for dividing a large group into smaller \\nones, something strange happens that I've never heard anyone mention explicitly. In the group \\none level up from yours, your boss represents your entire group. A group of 10 managers is not \\nmerely a group of 10 people working together in the usual way. It's really a group of groups. \\nWhich means for a group of 10 managers to work together as if they were simply a group of 10 \\nindividuals, the group working for each manager would hav\", \"n the usual way.

But in a large \\norganization divided into groups in this way, the pressure is always in that direction. Each group \\ntries its best to work as if it were the small group of individuals that humans were designed to \\nwork in. That was the point of creating it. And when you propagate that constraint, the result is \\nthat each person gets freedom of action in inverse proportion to the size of the entire tree.

The number of people \\nyou interact with is about right. But something is missing: individual initiative. Tribes of hunter-\\ngatherers have much more freedom. The leaders have a little more power than other members \\nof the tribe, but they don't generally tell them what to do and when the way a boss can.\\nIt's not your boss's fault. The real problem is that in the group above you in the hierarchy, your \\nentire group is one virtual person. Your boss is just the way that constraint is imparted to you.\\nSo working in a group of 10 people within a large organization feels both right and wrong at the \\nsame time.

Well, food shows that pretty clearly. If you were dropped at a random point \\nin America today, nearly all the food around you would be bad for you.

There are two main reasons. One is that \\nit has more immediate appeal. You may feel lousy an hour after eating that pizza, but eating the \\nfirst couple bites feels great. The other is economies of scale. Producing junk food scales; \\nproducing fresh vegetables doesn\\'t.

The average MIT graduate wants to work at Google or Microsoft, \\nbecause it's a recognized brand, it's safe, and they'll get paid a good salary right away. It's the \\njob equivalent of the pizza they had for lunch. The drawbacks will only become apparent later, \\nand then only in a vague sense of malaise.\\nAnd founders and early employees of startups, meanwhile, are like the Birkenstock-wearing \\nweirdos of Berkeley: though a tiny minority of the population, they're the ones living as humans \\nare meant to.

So a programmer working as programmers are meant to \\nis always making new things.

We started Viaweb with $10,000 in seed money from our friend Julian. He was a \\nlawyer and arranged all our paperwork, so we could just code.

I just don\\'t \\nunderstand why people troll like they do. I\\'ve thought a lot over the last couple years about the \\nproblem of trolls. It\\'s an old one, as old as forums, but we\\'re still just learning what the causes \\nare and how to address them.\\nThere are two senses of the word \"troll.\" In the original sense it meant someone, usually an \\noutsider, who deliberately stirred up fights in a forum by saying controversial things. [1] For \\nexample, someone who didn\\'t use a certain programming language might go to a forum for \\nusers of that language and mak', \"eliberately stirred up fights in a forum by saying controversial things. [1] For \\nexample, someone who didn't use a certain programming language might go to a forum for \\nusers of that language and make disparaging remarks about it, then sit back and watch as \\npeople rose to the bait. This sort of trolling was in the nature of a practical joke, like letting a bat \\nloose in a room full of people.\\nThe definition then spread to people who behaved like assholes in forums, whether intentionally \\nor not. Now when people talk about trolls they usually mean this broader sense of the word. \\nThough in a sense this is historically inaccurate, it is in other ways more accurate, because \\nwhen someone is being an asshole it's usually uncertain even in their own mind how much is \\ndeliberate. That is arguably one of the defining qualities of an asshole.\\nI think trolling in the broader sense has four causes. The most important is distance. People will \\nsay things in anonymous forums that they'd never da\", 'bly one of the defining qualities of an asshole.\\nI think trolling in the broader sense has four causes. The most important is distance. People will \\nsay things in anonymous forums that they\\'d never dare say to someone\\'s face, just as they\\'ll do \\nthings in cars that they\\'d never do as pedestrians ÿý like tailgate people, or honk at them, or cut \\nthem off.\\nTrolling tends to be particularly bad in forums related to computers, and I think that\\'s due to the \\nkind of people you find there. Most of them (myself included) are more comfortable dealing with \\nabstract ideas than with people. Hackers can be abrupt even in person. Put them on an \\nanonymous forum, and the problem gets worse.\\nThe third cause of trolling is incompetence. If you disagree with something, it\\'s easier to say \\n\"you suck\" than to figure out and explain exactly what you disagree with. You\\'re also safe that \\nway from refutation. In this respect trolling is a lot like graffiti. Graffiti happens at the intersection \\nof ambition', \"to figure out and explain exactly what you disagree with. You're also safe that \\nway from refutation. In this respect trolling is a lot like graffiti. Graffiti happens at the intersection \\nof ambition and incompetence: people want to make their mark on the world, but have no other \\nway to do it than literally making a mark on the world. [2]\\nThe final contributing factor is the culture of the forum. Trolls are like children (many are \\nchildren) in that they're capable of a wide range of behavior depending on what they think will \\nbe tolerated. In a place where rudeness isn't tolerated, most can be polite. But vice versa as \\nwell.\\nThere's a sort of Gresham's Law of trolls: trolls are willing to use a forum with a lot of thoughtful \\npeople in it, but thoughtful people aren't willing to use a forum with a lot of trolls in it. Which \\nmeans that once trolling takes hold, it tends to become the dominant culture.

That had already \\nhappened to Slashdot and Digg by the time I paid attention to comment threads there, but I \\nwatched it happen to Reddit.\\nNews.YC is, among other things, an experiment to see if this fate can be avoided. The sites's \\nguidelines explicitly ask people not to say things they wouldn't say face to face. If someone \\nstarts being rude, other users will step in and tell them to stop. And when people seem to be \\ndeliberately trolling, we ban them ruthlessly.\\nTechnical tweaks may also help. On Reddit, votes on your comments don't affect your karma \\nscore, but they do on News.YC. And it does seem to influence people when they can see their \\nreputation in the eyes of their peers drain away after making an asshole remark. Often users \\nhave second thoughts and delete such comments.\\nOne might worry this would prevent people from expressing controversial ideas, but em\", \"their peers drain away after making an asshole remark.

When people say something substantial that gets \\nmodded down, they stubbornly leave it up. What people delete are wisecracks, because they \\nhave less invested in them.\\nSo far the experiment seems to be working. The level of conversation on News.YC is as high as \\non any forum I've seen. But we still only have about 8,000 uniques a day. The conversations on \\nReddit were good when it was that small. The challenge is whether we can keep things this way.\\nI'm optimistic we will. We're not depending just on technical tricks.

Though simple solutions are better, they \\ndon't seem as impressive as complex ones. Overlooked problems are by definition problems \\nthat most people think don't matter.

That never happened before. I only heard the first few sentences, but that was enough \\nto tell what I said that upset him: that startups would do better if they moved to Silicon Valley.\\nThis conference was in London, and most of the audience seemed to be from the UK. So \\nsaying startups should move to Silicon Valley seemed like a nationalistic remark: an obnoxious \\nAmerican telling them that if they wanted to do things right they should all just move to America.\\nActually I\\'m less American than I seem. I didn\\'t say so, but I\\'m British by birth. And just as Jews \\nare ex officio allowed to tell Jewish ', \"ted to do things right they should all just move to America.\\nActually I'm less American than I seem. I didn't say so, but I'm British by birth. And just as Jews \\nare ex officio allowed to tell Jewish jokes, I don't feel like I have to bother being diplomatic with \\na British audience.\\nThe idea that startups would do better to move to Silicon Valley is not even a nationalistic one. \\n[1] It's the same thing I say to startups in the US. Y Combinator alternates between coasts \\nevery 6 months. Every other funding cycle is in Boston. And even though Boston is the second \\nbiggest startup hub in the US (and the world), we tell the startups from those cycles that their \\nbest bet is to move to Silicon Valley. If that's true of Boston, it's even more true of every other \\ncity.\\nThis is about cities, not countries.\\nAnd I think I can prove I'm right.

Most people could see how it might be helpful to be in a place \\nwhere there was infrastructure for startups, accumulated knowledge about how to make them \\nwork, and other people trying to do it. And yet whatever argument you use to prove that \\nstartups don't need to move from London to Silicon Valley could equally well be used to prove \\nstartups don't need to move from smaller towns to London.\\nThe difference between cities is a matter of degree. And if, as nearly everyone who knows \\nagrees, startups are better off in Silicon Valley than Boston, then they're better off in Silicon \\nValley than everywhere else too.\\nI realize I might seem to have a vested interest in thi\", \"e who knows \\nagrees, startups are better off in Silicon Valley than Boston, then they're better off in Silicon \\nValley than everywhere else too.\\nI realize I might seem to have a vested interest in this conclusion, because startups that move \\nto the US might do it through Y Combinator. But the American startups we've funded will attest \\nthat I say the same thing to them.\\nI'm not claiming of course that every startup has to go to Silicon Valley to succeed. Just that all \\nother things being equal, the more of a startup hub a place is, the better startups will do there. \\nBut other considerations can outweigh the advantages of moving. I'm not saying founders with \\nfamilies should uproot them to move halfway around the world; that might be too much of a \\ndistraction.\\nImmigration difficulties might be another reason to stay put.

Silicon Valley \\ninvestors are noticeably more aggressive than Boston ones. Over and over, I've seen startups \\nwe've funded snatched by west coast investors out from under the noses of Boston investors \\nwho saw them first but acted too slowly. At this year's Boston Demo Day, I told the audience \\nthat this happened every year, so if they saw a startup they liked, they should make them an \\noffer. And yet within a month it had happened again: an aggressive west coast VC who had met \\nthe founder of a YC-funded startup a week before beat out a Boston VC who had known him for \\nyears. By the time the Boston VC grasped what was happening, the deal was already gone.\\nBoston investors will admit they're more \", \"nded startup a week before beat out a Boston VC who had known him for \\nyears.

Get funded by Y Combinator. \\n October 2007\\n(This essay is derived from a keynote at FOWA in October 2007.)\\nThere\\'s something interesting happening right now. Startups are undergoing the same \\ntransformation that technology does when it becomes cheaper.\\nIt\\'s a pattern we see over and over in technology. Initially there\\'s some device that\\'s very \\nexpensive and made in small quantities. The', \" \\ntransformation that technology does when it becomes cheaper.\\nIt's a pattern we see over and over in technology. Initially there's some device that's very \\nexpensive and made in small quantities. Then someone discovers how to make them cheaply; \\nmany more get built; and as a result they can be used in new ways.\\nComputers are a familiar example. When I was a kid, computers were big, expensive machines \\nbuilt one at a time. Now they're a commodity. Now we can stick computers in everything.\\nThis pattern is very old. Most of the turning points in economic history are instances of it. It \\nhappened to steel in the 1850s, and to power in the 1780s. It happened to cloth manufacture in \\nthe thirteenth century, generating the wealth that later brought about the Renaissance. \\nAgriculture itself was an instance of this pattern.\\nNow as well as being produced by startups, this pattern is happening to startups. It's so cheap \\nto start web startups that orders of magnitudes more will be started. If t\", \"an instance of this pattern.\\nNow as well as being produced by startups, this pattern is happening to startups. It's so cheap \\nto start web startups that orders of magnitudes more will be started. If the pattern holds true, \\nthat should cause dramatic changes.\\n1. Lots of Startups\\nSo my first prediction about the future of web startups is pretty straightforward: there will be a \\nlot of them. When starting a startup was expensive, you had to get the permission of investors \\nto do it. Now the only threshold is courage.\\nEven that threshold is getting lower, as people watch others take the plunge and survive. In the \\nlast batch of startups we funded, we had several founders who said they'd thought of applying \\nbefore, but weren't sure and got jobs instead. It was only after hearing reports of friends who'd \\ndone it that they decided to try it themselves.\\nStarting a startup is hard, but having a 9 to 5 job is hard too, and in some ways a worse kind of \\nhard. In a startup you have lots of worr\", \"iends who'd \\ndone it that they decided to try it themselves.\\nStarting a startup is hard, but having a 9 to 5 job is hard too, and in some ways a worse kind of \\nhard. In a startup you have lots of worries, but you don't have that feeling that your life is flying \\nby like you do in a big company. Plus in a startup you could make much more money.\\nAs word spreads that startups work, the number may grow to a point that would now seem \\nsurprising.\\nWe now think of it as normal to have a job at a company, but this is the thinnest of historical \\nveneers. Just two or three lifetimes ago, most people in what are now called industrialized \\ncountries lived by farming. So while it may seem surprising to propose that large numbers of \\npeople will change the way they make a living, it would be more surprising if they didn't.\\n2. Standardization\\nWhen technology makes something dramatically cheaper, standardization always follows. \\nWhen you make things in large volumes you tend to standardize everything \", \"sing if they didn't.\\n2. Standardization\\nWhen technology makes something dramatically cheaper, standardization always follows. \\nWhen you make things in large volumes you tend to standardize everything that doesn't need to \\nchange.\\nAt Y Combinator we still only have four people, so we try to standardize everything. We could \\nhire employees, but we want to be forced to figure out how to scale investing.\\nWe often tell startups to release a minimal version one quickly, then let the needs of the users \\ndetermine what to do next. In essense, let the market design the product. We've done the same \\nthing ourselves. We think of the techniques we're developing for dealing with large numbers of \\nstartups as like software. Sometimes it literally is software, like Hacker News and our \\napplication system.\\nOne of the most important things we've been working on standardizing are investment terms. \\nTill now investment terms have been individually negotiated.

This is a problem for founders, \\nbecause it makes raising money take longer and cost more in legal fees. So as well as using \\nthe same paperwork for every deal we do, we've commissioned generic angel paperwork that \\nall the startups we fund can use for future rounds.\\nSome investors will still want to cook up their own deal terms. Series A rounds, where you raise \\na million dollars or more, will be custom deals for the forseeable future. But I think angel rounds \\nwill start to be done mostly with standardized agreements. An angel who wants to insert a \\nbunch of complicated terms into the agreement is probably not one you want anyway.\\n3. New Attitude to Acquisition\\nAnother thing I see starting to get standardized is acquisitions.

As the volume of startups \\nincreases, big companies will start to develop standardized procedures that make acquisitions \\nlittle more work than hiring someone.\\nGoogle is the leader here, as in so many areas of technology. They buy a lot of startups— more \\nthan most people realize, because they only announce a fraction of them. And being Google, \\nthey're figuring out how to do it efficiently.\\nOne problem they've solved is how to think about acquisitions. For most companies, \\nacquisitions still carry some stigma of inadequacy. Companies do them because they have to, \\nbut there's usually some feeling they shouldn't have to—that their own programmers should be \\nable to build everything they need.\\nGoogle's example should cure the rest of the world of this idea. Google has by far the best \\nprogrammers of any public technology company. If they don't have a problem doing \\nacquisitions, the others shoul\", \"e's example should cure the rest of the world of this idea. Google has by far the best \\nprogrammers of any public technology company. If they don't have a problem doing \\nacquisitions, the others should have even less problem. However many Google does, Microsoft \\nshould do ten times as many.\\nOne reason Google doesn't have a problem with acquisitions is that they know first-hand the \\nquality of the people they can get that way. Larry and Sergey only started Google after making \\nthe rounds of the search engines trying to sell their idea and finding no takers. They've been the \\nguys coming in to visit the big company, so they know who might be sitting across that \\nconference table from them.\\n4. Riskier Strategies are Possible\\nRisk is always proportionate to reward. The way to get really big returns is to do things that \\nseem crazy, like starting a new search engine in 1998, or turning down a billion dollar \\nacquisition offer.\\nThis has traditionally been a problem in venture funding. Founde\", \"turns is to do things that \\nseem crazy, like starting a new search engine in 1998, or turning down a billion dollar \\nacquisition offer.\\nThis has traditionally been a problem in venture funding. Founders and investors have different \\nattitudes to risk. Knowing that risk is on average proportionate to reward, investors like risky \\nstrategies, while founders, who don't have a big enough sample size to care what's true on \\naverage, tend to be more conservative.\\nIf startups are easy to start, this conflict goes away, because founders can start them younger, \\nwhen it's rational to take more risk, and can start more startups total in their careers. When \\nfounders can do lots of startups, they can start to look at the world in the same portfolio-\\noptimizing way as investors. And that means the overall amount of wealth created can be \\ngreater, because strategies can be riskier.\\n5. Younger, Nerdier Founders\\nIf startups become a cheap commodity, more people will be able to have them, just as more\", \"rall amount of wealth created can be \\ngreater, because strategies can be riskier.\\n5. Younger, Nerdier Founders\\nIf startups become a cheap commodity, more people will be able to have them, just as more \\npeople could have computers once microprocessors made them cheap. And in particular, \\nyounger and more technical founders will be able to start startups than could before.\\nBack when it cost a lot to start a startup, you had to convince investors to let you do it. And that \\nrequired very different skills from actually doing the startup. If investors were perfect judges, the \\ntwo would require exactly the same skills. But unfortunately most investors are terrible judges. I \\nknow because I see behind the scenes what an enormous amount of work it takes to raise \\nmoney, and the amount of selling required in an industry is always inversely proportional to the \\njudgement of the buyers.\\nFortunately, if startups get cheaper to start, there's another way to convince investors.

Then instead \\nof having to seem smooth and confident, you can just point them to Alexa.\\nThis way of convincing investors is better suited to hackers, who often went into technology in \\npart because they felt uncomfortable with the amount of fakeness required in other fields.\\n6. Startup Hubs Will Persist\\nIt might seem that if startups get cheap to start, it will mean the end of startup hubs like Silicon \\nValley. If all you need to start a startup is rent money, you should be able to do it anywhere.\\nThis is kind of true and kind of false.\", \"eap to start, it will mean the end of startup hubs like Silicon \\nValley. If all you need to start a startup is rent money, you should be able to do it anywhere.\\nThis is kind of true and kind of false. It's true that you can now start a startup anywhere. But you \\nhave to do more with a startup than just start it. You have to make it succeed. And that is more \\nlikely to happen in a startup hub.\\nI've thought a lot about this question, and it seems to me the increasing cheapness of web \\nstartups will if anything increase the importance of startup hubs. The value of startup hubs, like \\ncenters for any kind of business, lies in something very old-fashioned: face to face meetings. No \\ntechnology in the immediate future will replace walking down University Ave and running into a \\nfriend who tells you how to fix a bug that's been bothering you all weekend, or visiting a friend's \\nstartup down the street and ending up in a conversation with one of their investors.\\nThe question of whether to be i\", 'you how to fix a bug that\\'s been bothering you all weekend, or visiting a friend\\'s \\nstartup down the street and ending up in a conversation with one of their investors.\\nThe question of whether to be in a startup hub is like the question of whether to take outside \\ninvestment. The question is not whether you need it, but whether it brings any advantage at all. \\nBecause anything that brings an advantage will give your competitors an advantage over you if \\nthey do it and you don\\'t. So if you hear someone saying \"we don\\'t need to be in Silicon Valley,\" \\nthat use of the word \"need\" is a sign they\\'re not even thinking about the question right.\\nAnd while startup hubs are as powerful magnets as ever, the increasing cheapness of starting a \\nstartup means the particles they\\'re attracting are getting lighter. A startup now can be just a pair \\nof 22 year old guys. A company like that can move much more easily than one with 10 people, \\nhalf of whom have kids.\\nWe know because we make people move for', \" lighter. A startup now can be just a pair \\nof 22 year old guys. A company like that can move much more easily than one with 10 people, \\nhalf of whom have kids.\\nWe know because we make people move for Y Combinator, and it doesn't seem to be a \\nproblem. The advantage of being able to work together face to face for three months outweighs \\nthe inconvenience of moving. Ask anyone who's done it.\\nThe mobility of seed-stage startups means that seed funding is a national business. One of the \\nmost common emails we get is from people asking if we can help them set up a local clone of Y \\nCombinator. But this just wouldn't work. Seed funding isn't regional, just as big research \\nuniversities aren't.\\nIs seed funding not merely national, but international? Interesting question. There are signs it \\nmay be.

If startups are \\nmobile, the best local talent will go to the real Silicon Valley, and all they'll get at the local one \\nwill be the people who didn't have the energy to move.\\nThis is not a nationalistic idea, incidentally. It's cities that compete, not countries. Atlanta is just \\nas hosed as Munich.\\n7. Better Judgement Needed\\nIf the number of startups increases dramatically, then the people whose job is to judge them are \\ngoing to have to get better at it. I'm thinking particularly of investors and acquirers. We now get \\non the order of 1000 applications a year. What are we going to do if we get 10,000?\\nThat's actually an alarming idea. But we'll figure out some kind of answer. We\", \" investors and acquirers. We now get \\non the order of 1000 applications a year. What are we going to do if we get 10,000?\\nThat's actually an alarming idea. But we'll figure out some kind of answer. We'll have to. It will \\nprobably involve writing some software, but fortunately we can do that.\\nAcquirers will also have to get better at picking winners. They generally do better than investors, \\nbecause they pick later, when there's more performance to measure. But even at the most \\nadvanced acquirers, identifying companies to buy is extremely ad hoc, and completing the \\nacquisition often involves a great deal of unneccessary friction.\\nI think acquirers may eventually have chief acquisition officers who will both identify good \\nacquisitions and make the deals happen. At the moment those two functions are separate. \\nPromising new startups are often discovered by developers. If someone powerful enough wants \\nto buy them, the deal is handed over to corp dev guys to negotiate. It would be bett\", 'nctions are separate. \\nPromising new startups are often discovered by developers. If someone powerful enough wants \\nto buy them, the deal is handed over to corp dev guys to negotiate. It would be better if both \\nwere combined in one group, headed by someone with a technical background and some vision \\nof what they wanted to accomplish. Maybe in the future big companies will have both a VP of \\nEngineering responsible for technology developed in-house, and a CAO responsible for \\nbringing technology in from outside.\\nAt the moment, there is no one within big companies who gets in trouble when they buy a \\nstartup for $200 million that they could have bought earlier for $20 million. There should start to \\nbe someone who gets in trouble for that.\\n8. College Will Change\\nIf the best hackers start their own companies after college instead of getting jobs, that will \\nchange what happens in college. Most of these changes will be for the better.

Most of these changes will be for the better. I think the \\nexperience of college is warped in a bad way by the expectation that afterward you\\'ll be judged \\nby potential employers.\\nOne change will be in the meaning of \"after college,\" which will switch from when one \\ngraduates from college to when one leaves it. If you\\'re starting your own company, why do you \\nneed a degree? We don\\'t encourage people to start startups during college, but the best \\nfounders are certainly capable of it. Some of the most successful companies we\\'ve funded were \\nstarted by undergrads.\\nI grew up in a time where college degrees seemed really important, so I\\'m alarmed to be saying \\nthings like this, but there\\'s nothing magical about a degree. There\\'s nothing that magically \\nchanges after you take that last exam. The importance of degrees is due solely to the \\nadministrative needs of large organizations.

The importance of degrees is due solely to the \\nadministrative needs of large organizations. These can certainly affect your life—it's hard to get \\ninto grad school, or to get a work visa in the US, without an undergraduate degree—but tests \\nlike this will matter less and less.\\nAs well as mattering less whether students get degrees, it will also start to matter less where \\nthey go to college. In a startup you're judged by users, and they don't care where you went to \\ncollege. So in a world of startups, elite universities will play less of a role as gatekeepers. In the \\nUS it's a national scandal how easily children of rich parents game college admissions. But the \\nway this problem ultimately gets solved may not be by reforming the universities but by going \\naround them.

If it becomes common to start a startup after college, students may \\nstart trying to maximize this. Instead of focusing on getting internships at companies they want \\nto work for, they may start to focus on working with other students they want as cofounders.\\nWhat students do in their classes will change too. Instead of trying to get good grades to \\nimpress future employers, students will try to learn things. We're talking about some pretty \\ndramatic changes here.\\n9. Lots of Competitors\\nIf it gets easier to start a startup, it's easier for competitors too. That doesn't erase the \\nadvantage of increased cheapness, however. You're not all playing a zer\", \"nges here.\\n9. Lots of Competitors\\nIf it gets easier to start a startup, it's easier for competitors too. That doesn't erase the \\nadvantage of increased cheapness, however. You're not all playing a zero-sum game. There's \\nnot some fixed number of startups that can succeed, regardless of how many are started.\\nIn fact, I don't think there's any limit to the number of startups that could succeed. Startups \\nsucceed by creating wealth, which is the satisfaction of people's desires. And people's desires \\nseem to be effectively infinite, at least in the short term.\\nWhat the increasing number of startups does mean is that you won't be able to sit on a good \\nidea. Other people have your idea, and they'll be increasingly likely to do something about it.\\n10. Faster Advances\\nThere's a good side to that, at least for consumers of technology.

They're like a character in a movie that everyone in the audience can see something bad \\nis about to happen to, but who can't see it himself. The big innovations that happen a company \\nat a time will obviously happen faster if the rate of new companies increases.\\nBut in fact there will be a double speed increase.

I talked recently to a \\nfounder whose startup had been acquired by a big company. He was a precise sort of guy, so \\nhe'd measured their productivity before and after. He counted lines of code, which can be a \\ndubious measure, but in this case was meaningful because it was the same group of \\nprogrammers. He found they were one thirteenth as productive after the acquisition.\\nThe company that bought them was not a particularly stupid one. I think what he was \\nmeasuring was mostly the cost of bigness. I experienced this myself, and his number sounds \\nabout right. There's something about big companies that just sucks the energy out of you.\\nImagine what all that energy could do if it were put to use.

The pipes are \\nnarrow and twisty, and there are leaks in every joint. In the future this mess will gradually be \\nreplaced by a single, huge pipe. The water will still have to get from A to B, but it will get there \\nfaster and without the risk of spraying out through some random leak.\\nThis will change a lot of things for the better.

So you end up with a world in which high school students \\nthink they need to get good grades to get into elite colleges, and college students think they \\nneed to get good grades to impress employers, within which the employees waste most of their \\ntime in political battles, and from which consumers have to buy anyway because there are so \\nfew choices.

I had several motives, some \\nmore honorable than others. One of the less honorable was to shock people.

Sort of like slashing holes in your clothes or putting a safety pin through \\nyour ear, which were other forms of impressive impracticality then just coming into fashion.\\nBut I had some more honest motives as well.

[2] O\", 'ile to grasp this, but when I \\ndid it was fairly sudden, like someone in the nineteenth century grasping evolution and realizing \\nthe story of creation they\\'d been told as a child was all wrong. [2] Outside of math there\\'s a limit \\nto how far you can push words; in fact, it would not be a bad definition of math to call it the \\nstudy of terms that have precise meanings. Everyday words are inherently imprecise. They \\nwork well enough in everyday life that you don\\'t notice. Words seem to work, just as Newtonian \\nphysics seems to. But you can always make them break if you push them far enough.\\nI would say that this has been, unfortunately for philosophy, the central fact of philosophy. Most \\nphilosophical debates are not merely afflicted by but driven by confusions over words. Do we \\nhave free will? Depends what you mean by \"free.\" Do abstract ideas exist? Depends what you \\nmean by \"exist.\"\\nWittgenstein is popularly credited with the idea that most philosophical controversies are due to \\nc', ' will?

I\\'m not sure how much credit to give him. I suspect a lot of people \\nrealized this, but reacted simply by not studying philosophy, rather than becoming philosophy \\nprofessors.\\nHow did things get this way? Can something people have spent thousands of years studying \\nreally be a waste of time? Those are interesting questions. In fact, some of the most interesting \\nquestions you can ask about philosophy. The most valuable way to approach the current \\nphilosophical tradition may be neither to get lost in pointless speculations like Berkeley, nor to \\nshut them down like Wittgenstein, but to study it as an example of reason gone wrong.\\nHistory\\nWestern philosophy really begins with Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. What we know of their \\npredecessors comes from fragments an', \"tgenstein, but to study it as an example of reason gone wrong.\\nHistory\\nWestern philosophy really begins with Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. What we know of their \\npredecessors comes from fragments and references in later works; their doctrines could be \\ndescribed as speculative cosmology that occasionally strays into analysis. Presumably they \\nwere driven by whatever makes people in every other society invent cosmologies. [3]\\nWith Socrates, Plato, and particularly Aristotle, this tradition turned a corner. There started to be \\na lot more analysis. I suspect Plato and Aristotle were encouraged in this by progress in math. \\nMathematicians had by then shown that you could figure things out in a much more conclusive \\nway than by making up fine sounding stories about them. [4]\\nPeople talk so much about abstractions now that we don't realize what a leap it must have been \\nwhen they first started to. It was presumably many thousands of years between when people \\nfirst started describing thin\", 'uch about abstractions now that we don\\'t realize what a leap it must have been \\nwhen they first started to. It was presumably many thousands of years between when people \\nfirst started describing things as hot or cold and when someone asked \"what is heat?\" No doubt \\nit was a very gradual process. We don\\'t know if Plato or Aristotle were the first to ask any of the \\nquestions they did. But their works are the oldest we have that do this on a large scale, and \\nthere is a freshness (not to say naivete) about them that suggests some of the questions they \\nasked were new to them, at least.\\nAristotle in particular reminds me of the phenomenon that happens when people discover \\nsomething new, and are so excited by it that they race through a huge percentage of the newly \\ndiscovered territory in one lifetime. If so, that\\'s evidence of how new this kind of thinking was. [5]\\nThis is all to explain how Plato and Aristotle can be very impressive and yet naive and \\nmistaken. It was impressive even ', 'ne lifetime. If so, that\\'s evidence of how new this kind of thinking was. [5]\\nThis is all to explain how Plato and Aristotle can be very impressive and yet naive and \\nmistaken. It was impressive even to ask the questions they did. That doesn\\'t mean they always \\ncame up with good answers. It\\'s not considered insulting to say that ancient Greek \\nmathematicians were naive in some respects, or at least lacked some concepts that would have \\nmade their lives easier. So I hope people will not be too offended if I propose that ancient \\nphilosophers were similarly naive. In particular, they don\\'t seem to have fully grasped what I \\nearlier called the central fact of philosophy: that words break if you push them too far.\\n\"Much to the surprise of the builders of the first digital computers,\" Rod Brooks wrote, \\n\"programs written for them usually did not work.\" [6] Something similar happened when people \\nfirst started trying to talk about abstractions.

[7]\\nSurely I\\'m not claiming that ideas have to have practical applications to be interesting? No, they \\nmay not have to. Hardy\\'s boast that number theory had no use whatsoever wouldn\\'t disqualify it. \\nBut he turned out to be mistaken.

And Aristotle's explanation of the ultimate goal of philosophy in Book A of \\nthe Metaphysics implies that philosophy should be useful too.\\nTheoretical Knowledge\\nAristotle's goal was to find the most general of general principles. The examples he gives are \\nconvincing: an ordinary worker builds things a certain way out of habit; a master craftsman can \\ndo more because he grasps the underlying principles. The trend is clear: the more general the \\nknowledge, the more admirable it is. But then he makes a mistake—possibly the most important \\nmistake in the history of philosophy. He has noticed that theoretical knowledge is often acquired \\nfor its own sake, out of curiosity, rather than for any practical need. So he proposes there are \\ntwo kinds of theoretical knowledge: some that's useful in practical matters and some that isn't. \\nSince people interested in the latter are interested in it for its own sake, it must\", \"oposes there are \\ntwo kinds of theoretical knowledge: some that's useful in practical matters and some that isn't. \\nSince people interested in the latter are interested in it for its own sake, it must be more noble. \\nSo he sets as his goal in the Metaphysics the exploration of knowledge that has no practical \\nuse. Which means no alarms go off when he takes on grand but vaguely understood questions \\nand ends up getting lost in a sea of words.\\nHis mistake was to confuse motive and result. Certainly, people who want a deep \\nunderstanding of something are often driven by curiosity rather than any practical need. But that \\ndoesn't mean what they end up learning is useless. It's very valuable in practice to have a deep \\nunderstanding of what you're doing; even if you're never called on to solve advanced problems, \\nyou can see shortcuts in the solution of simple ones, and your knowledge won't break down in \\nedge cases, as it would if you were relying on formulas you didn't understand. Knowled\", \"advanced problems, \\nyou can see shortcuts in the solution of simple ones, and your knowledge won't break down in \\nedge cases, as it would if you were relying on formulas you didn't understand. Knowledge is \\npower. That's what makes theoretical knowledge prestigious. It's also what causes smart people \\nto be curious about certain things and not others; our DNA is not so disinterested as we might \\nthink.\\nSo while ideas don't have to have immediate practical applications to be interesting, the kinds \\nof things we find interesting will surprisingly often turn out to have practical applications.\\nThe reason Aristotle didn't get anywhere in the Metaphysics was partly that he set off with \\ncontradictory aims: to explore the most abstract ideas, guided by the assumption that they were \\nuseless. He was like an explorer looking for a territory to the north of him, starting with the \\nassumption that it was located to the south.\\nAnd since his work became the map used by generations of future explor\", \"was like an explorer looking for a territory to the north of him, starting with the \\nassumption that it was located to the south.\\nAnd since his work became the map used by generations of future explorers, he sent them off \\nin the wrong direction as well. [8] Perhaps worst of all, he protected them from both the criticism \\nof outsiders and the promptings of their own inner compass by establishing the principle that \\nthe most noble sort of theoretical knowledge had to be useless.\\nThe Metaphysics is mostly a failed experiment. A few ideas from it turned out to be worth \\nkeeping; the bulk of it has had no effect at all. The Metaphysics is among the least read of all \\nfamous books. It's not hard to understand the way Newton's Principia is, but the way a garbled \\nmessage is.\\nArguably it's an interesting failed experiment.

But unfortunately that was not the conclusion \\nAristotle's successors derived from works like the Metaphysics. [9] Soon after, the western \\nworld fell on intellectual hard times. Instead of version 1s to be superseded, the works of Plato \\nand Aristotle became revered texts to be mastered and discussed. And so things remained for a \\nshockingly long time. It was not till around 1600 (in Europe, where the center of gravity had \\nshifted by then) that one found people confident enough to treat Aristotle's work as a catalog of \\nmistakes. And even then they rarely said so outright.\\nIf it seems surprising that the gap was so long, consider how little progress there was in math \\nbetween Hellenistic times and the Renaissance.\\nIn the intervening years an unfortunate idea took hold: that it was not only acceptable to \\nproduce works like the Metaphysics, but that it was a particularly prestigious line of work, done \\nby a class of people called philosophers.

And so instead of correcting the problem Aristotle discovered by falling \\ninto it—that you can easily get lost if you talk too loosely about very abstract ideas—they \\ncontinued to fall into it.\\nThe Singularity\\nCuriously, however, the works they produced continued to attract new readers. Traditional \\nphilosophy occupies a kind of singularity in this respect. If you write in an unclear way about big \\nideas, you produce something that seems tantalizingly attractive to inexperienced but \\nintellectually ambitious students. Till one knows better, it's hard to distinguish something that's \\nhard to understand because the writer was unclear in his own mind from something like a \\nmathematical proof that's hard to understand because the ideas i\", \"er, it's hard to distinguish something that's \\nhard to understand because the writer was unclear in his own mind from something like a \\nmathematical proof that's hard to understand because the ideas it represents are hard to \\nunderstand. To someone who hasn't learned the difference, traditional philosophy seems \\nextremely attractive: as hard (and therefore impressive) as math, yet broader in scope. That \\nwas what lured me in as a high school student.\\nThis singularity is even more singular in having its own defense built in. When things are hard to \\nunderstand, people who suspect they're nonsense generally keep quiet. There's no way to \\nprove a text is meaningless. The closest you can get is to show that the official judges of some \\nclass of texts can't distinguish them from placebos. [10]\\nAnd so instead of denouncing philosophy, most people who suspected it was a waste of time \\njust studied other things. That alone is fairly damning evidence, considering philosophy's claims. \\nIt's supp\", \"And so instead of denouncing philosophy, most people who suspected it was a waste of time \\njust studied other things.

Surely all smart people would be interested in it, if \\nit delivered on that promise.\\nBecause philosophy's flaws turned away the sort of people who might have corrected them, \\nthey tended to be self-perpetuating. Bertrand Russell wrote in a letter in 1912: Hitherto the \\npeople attracted to philosophy have been mostly those who loved the big generalizations, which \\nwere all wrong, so that few people with exact minds have taken up the subject. [11] His \\nresponse was to launch Wittgenstein at it, with dramatic results.\\nI think Wittgenstein deserves to be famous not for the discovery that most previous philosophy \\nwas a waste of time, which judging from the circumstantial evidence must have been made by \\nevery smart person who studied a little philosophy an\", 's not for the discovery that most previous philosophy \\nwas a waste of time, which judging from the circumstantial evidence must have been made by \\nevery smart person who studied a little philosophy and declined to pursue it further, but for how \\nhe acted in response. [12] Instead of quietly switching to another field, he made a fuss, from \\ninside. He was Gorbachev.\\nThe field of philosophy is still shaken from the fright Wittgenstein gave it. [13] Later in life he \\nspent a lot of time talking about how words worked. Since that seems to be allowed, that\\'s what \\na lot of philosophers do now. Meanwhile, sensing a vacuum in the metaphysical speculation \\ndepartment, the people who used to do literary criticism have been edging Kantward, under \\nnew names like \"literary theory,\" \"critical theory,\" and when they\\'re feeling ambitious, plain \\n\"theory.\" The writing is the familiar word salad: Gender is not like some of the other grammatical \\nmodes which express precisely a mode of conception witho', ' and when they\\'re feeling ambitious, plain \\n\"theory.\" The writing is the familiar word salad: Gender is not like some of the other grammatical \\nmodes which express precisely a mode of conception without any reality that corresponds to \\nthe conceptual mode, and consequently do not express precisely something in reality by which \\nthe intellect could be moved to conceive a thing the way it does, even where that motive is not \\nsomething in the thing as such. [14] The singularity I\\'ve described is not going away. There\\'s a \\nmarket for writing that sounds impressive and can\\'t be disproven. There will always be both \\nsupply and demand. So if one group abandons this territory, there will always be others ready to \\noccupy it.\\nA Proposal\\nWe may be able to do better. Here\\'s an intriguing possibility.

And users don't care where you went to college.\\nAs well as having precisely measurable results, we have a lot of them. Instead of doing a small \\nnumber of large deals like a traditio\", \"hat you've built. And users don't care where you went to college.\\nAs well as having precisely measurable results, we have a lot of them. Instead of doing a small \\nnumber of large deals like a traditional venture capital fund, we do a large number of small \\nones. We currently fund about 40 companies a year, selected from about 900 applications \\nrepresenting a total of about 2000 people. [1]\\nBetween the volume of people we judge and the rapid, unequivocal test that's applied to our \\nchoices, Y Combinator has been an unprecedented opportunity for learning how to pick \\nwinners. One of the most surprising things we've learned is how little it matters where people \\nwent to college.\\nI thought I'd already been cured of caring about that. There's nothing like going to grad school \\nat Harvard to cure you of any illusions you might have about the average Harvard undergrad. \\nAnd yet Y Combinator showed us we were still overestimating people who'd been to elite \\ncolleges.

Even people who hate you for it believe it.\\nBut when you think about what it means to have gone to an elite college, how could this be \\ntrue? We're talking about a decision made by admissions officers—basically, HR people—\\nbased on a cursory examination of a huge pile of depressingly similar applications submitted by \\nseventeen year olds. And what do they have to go on? An easily gamed standardized test; a \\nshort essay telling you what the kid thinks you want to hear; an interview with a random alum; a \\nhigh school record that's large\", ' And what do they have to go on? An easily gamed standardized test; a \\nshort essay telling you what the kid thinks you want to hear; an interview with a random alum; a \\nhigh school record that\\'s largely an index of obedience. Who would rely on such a test?\\nAnd yet a lot of companies do. A lot of companies are very much influenced by where \\napplicants went to college. How could they be? I think I know the answer to that.\\nThere used to be a saying in the corporate world: \"No one ever got fired for buying IBM.\" You no \\nlonger hear this about IBM specifically, but the idea is very much alive; there is a whole \\ncategory of \"enterprise\" software companies that exist to take advantage of it. People buying \\ntechnology for large organizations don\\'t care if they pay a fortune for mediocre software. It\\'s not \\ntheir money. They just want to buy from a supplier who seems safe—a company with an \\nestablished name, confident salesmen, impressive offices, and software that conforms to all the \\ncurrent ', \"It's not \\ntheir money. They just want to buy from a supplier who seems safe—a company with an \\nestablished name, confident salesmen, impressive offices, and software that conforms to all the \\ncurrent fashions. Not necessarily a company that will deliver so much as one that, if they do let \\nyou down, will still seem to have been a prudent choice. So companies have evolved to fill that \\nniche.\\nA recruiter at a big company is in much the same position as someone buying technology for \\none. If someone went to Stanford and is not obviously insane, they're probably a safe bet. And a \\nsafe bet is enough. No one ever measures recruiters by the later performance of people they \\nturn down. [2]\\nI'm not saying, of course, that elite colleges have evolved to prey upon the weaknesses of large \\norganizations the way enterprise software companies have. But they work as if they had.

They're good at doing what they're asked, \\nsince that's what it takes to please the adults who judge you at seventeen. And having been to \\nan elite college makes them more confident.\\nBack in the days when people might spend their whole career at one big company, these \\nqualities must have been very valuable. Graduates of elite colleges would have been capable, \\nyet amenable to authority. And since individual performance is so hard to measure in large \\norganizations, their own confidence would have been the starting point for their reputation.\\nThings are very different in the new world of startups.

All users care abo\", \" different in the new world of startups. We couldn't save someone from the \\nmarket's judgement even if we wanted to. And being charming and confident counts for nothing \\nwith users. All users care about is whether you make something they like. If you don't, you're \\ndead.\\nKnowing that test is coming makes us work a lot harder to get the right answers than anyone \\nwould if they were merely hiring people. We can't afford to have any illusions about the \\npredictors of success. And what we've found is that the variation between schools is so much \\nsmaller than the variation between individuals that it's negligible by comparison. We can learn \\nmore about someone in the first minute of talking to them than by knowing where they went to \\nschool.\\nIt seems obvious when you put it that way. Look at the individual, not where they went to \\ncollege. But that's a weaker statement than the idea I began with, that it doesn't matter much \\nwhere a given individual goes to college. Don't you learn things \", \"he individual, not where they went to \\ncollege. But that's a weaker statement than the idea I began with, that it doesn't matter much \\nwhere a given individual goes to college. Don't you learn things at the best schools that you \\nwouldn't learn at lesser places?\\nApparently not. Obviously you can't prove this in the case of a single individual, but you can tell \\nfrom aggregate evidence: you can't, without asking them, distinguish people who went to one \\nschool from those who went to another three times as far down the US News list. [3] Try it and \\nsee.\\nHow can this be? Because how much you learn in college depends a lot more on you than the \\ncollege. A determined party animal can get through the best school without learning anything. \\nAnd someone with a real thirst for knowledge will be able to find a few smart people to learn \\nfrom at a school that isn't prestigious at all.\\nThe other students are the biggest advantage of going to an elite college; you learn more from \\nthem than the pro\", \"e to find a few smart people to learn \\nfrom at a school that isn't prestigious at all.\\nThe other students are the biggest advantage of going to an elite college; you learn more from \\nthem than the professors. But you should be able to reproduce this at most colleges if you make \\na conscious effort to find smart friends. At most colleges you can find at least a handful of other \\nsmart students, and most people have only a handful of close friends in college anyway. [4] The \\nodds of finding smart professors are even better. The curve for faculty is a lot flatter than for \\nstudents, especially in math and the hard sciences; you have to go pretty far down the list of \\ncolleges before you stop finding smart professors in the math department.\\nSo it's not surprising that we've found the relative prestige of different colleges useless in \\njudging individuals. There's a lot of randomness in how colleges select people, and what they \\nlearn there depends much more on them than the college. Betwee\", \"prestige of different colleges useless in \\njudging individuals. There's a lot of randomness in how colleges select people, and what they \\nlearn there depends much more on them than the college. Between these two sources of \\nvariation, the college someone went to doesn't mean a lot. It is to some degree a predictor of \\nability, but so weak that we regard it mainly as a source of error and try consciously to ignore it.\\nI doubt what we've discovered is an anomaly specific to startups. Probably people have always \\noverestimated the importance of where one goes to college. We're just finally able to measure it.\\nThe unfortunate thing is not just that people are judged by such a superficial test, but that so \\nmany judge themselves by it. A lot of people, probably the majority of people in America, have \\nsome amount of insecurity about where, or whether, they went to college.

When you're excluded, you can only imagine \\nthe advantages of being an insider. But invariably they're larger in your imagination than in real \\nlife.\\nSo it is with colleges. Colleges differ, but they're nothing like the stamp of destiny so many \\nimagine them to be. People aren't what some admissions officer decides about them at \\nseventeen. They're what they make themselves.\\nIndeed, the great advantage of not caring where people went to college is not just that you can \\nstop judging them (and yourself) by superficial measures, but that you can f\", \"what they make themselves.\\nIndeed, the great advantage of not caring where people went to college is not just that you can \\nstop judging them (and yourself) by superficial measures, but that you can focus instead on \\nwhat really matters.

Their job isn't to get good grades so they can get into a good college, but to learn and do. \\nAnd not just because that's more rewarding than worldly success. That will increasingly be the \\nroute to worldly success.\\nNotes:\\n[1] Is what we measure worth measuring? I think so. You can get rich simply by being energetic and unscrupulous, \\nbut getting rich from a technology startup takes some amount of brains. It is just the kind of work the upper middle \\nclass values; it has about the same intellectual component as being a doctor.\\n[2] Actually, someone did, once.

Mitch Kapor's wife Freada was in charge of HR at Lotus in the early years. (As he is \\nat pains to point out, they did not become romantically involved till afterward.) At one point they worried Lotus was \\nlosing its startup edge and turning into a big company. So as an experiment she sent their recruiters the resumes of \\nthe first 40 employees, with identifying details changed. These were the people who had made Lotus into the star it \\nwas. Not one got an interview.\\n[3] The US News list? Surely no one trusts that. Even if the statistics they consider are useful, how do they decide on \\nthe relative weights? The reason the US News list is meaningful is precisely because they are so intellectually \\ndishonest in that respect. There is no external source they can use to calibrate the weighting of the statistics they \\nuse; if there were, we could just use that instead. What they must do is adjust the wei\", \"est in that respect.

What they must do is adjust the weights till the top schools are the \\nusual suspects in about the right order. So in effect what the US News list tells us is what the editors think the top \\nschools are, which is probably not far from the conventional wisdom on the matter. The amusing thing is, because \\nsome schools work hard to game the system, the editors will have to keep tweaking their algorithm to get the \\nrankings they want.\\n[4] Possible doesn't mean easy, of course.

Actually I was being conservative. I'm hoping it might be as much as a half. \\nWouldn't it be amazing if we could achieve a 50% success rate?\\nAnother way of saying that is that half of you are going to die.

If half the startups we fund succeed, then half of you are \\ngoing to get rich and the other half are going to get nothing.\\nIf you can just avoid dying, you get rich. That sounds like a joke, but it's actually a pretty good \\ndescription of what happens in a typical startup. It certainly describes what happened in \\nViaweb. We avoided dying till we got rich.\\nIt was really close, too. When we were visiting Yahoo to talk about being acquired, we had to \\ninterrupt everything and borrow one of their conference rooms to talk down an investor who was \\nabout to back out of a new funding round we needed to stay alive.

You've \\nnow done the preparation. The work you've done so far has, in effect, put you in a position to \\nget lucky: you can now get rich by not letting your company die. That's more than most people \\nhave. So let's talk about how not to die.\\nWe've done this five times now, and we've seen a bunch of startups die. About 10 of them so \\nfar. We don't know exactly what happens when they die, because they generally don't die loudly \\nand heroically. Mostly they crawl off somewhere and die.\\nFor us the main indication of impending doom is when we don't hear from you.

So far that is a 100% \\naccurate predictor of death.\\nWhereas if a startup regularly does new deals and releases and either sends us mail or shows \\nup at YC events, they're probably going to live.\\nI realize this will sound naive, but maybe the linkage works in both directions. Maybe if you can \\narrange that we keep hearing from you, you won't die.\\nThat may not be so naive as it sounds. You've probably noticed that having dinners every \\nTuesday with us and the other founders causes you to get more done than you would \\notherwise, because every dinner is a mini Demo Day.

If you move there, the peer pressure that made you work harder all \\nsummer will continue to operate.\\nWhen startups die, the official cause of death is always either running out of money or a critical \\nfounder bailing.

And when writing for yourself you have different priorities. If you're writing for other \\npeople, you may not want to make code too dense. Some parts of a program may be easiest to \\nread if you spread things out, like an introductory textbook. Whereas if you're writing code to \\nmake it easy to reload into your head, it may be best to go for brevity.\\n Work in small groups.

Whereas if you're writing code to \\nmake it easy to reload into your head, it may be best to go for brevity.\\n Work in small groups. When you manipulate a program in your head, your vision tends to stop \\nat the edge of the code you own. Other parts you don't understand as well, and more \\nimportantly, can't take liberties with. So the smaller the number of programmers, the more \\ncompletely a project can mutate. If there's just one programmer, as there often is at first, you \\ncan do all-encompassing redesigns.\\n Don't have multiple people editing the same piece of code. You never understand other \\npeople's code as well as your own. No matter how thoroughly you've read it, you've only read it, \\nnot written it. So if a piece of code is written by multiple authors, none of them understand it as \\nwell as a single author would.\\nAnd of course you can't safely redesign something other people are working on. It's not just that \\nyou'd have to ask permission.

A program gets easier to hold in your head as you become familiar with it. You can \\nstart to treat parts as black boxes once you feel confident you've fully explored them. But when \\nyou first start working on a project, you're forced to see everything. If you start with too big a \\nproblem, you may never quite be able to encompass it.

Whatever the advantages of planning, they\\'re often outweighed \\nby the advantages of being able to keep a program in your head. It\\'s striking how often \\nprogrammers manage to hit all eight points by accident. Someone has an idea for a new \\nproject, but because it\\'s not officially sanctioned, he has to do it in off hours—which turn out to \\nbe more productive because there are no distractions. Driven by his enthusiasm for the new \\nproject he works on it for many hours at a stretch. Because it\\'s initially just an experiment, \\ninstead of a \"production\" language he uses a mere \"scripting\" language—which is in fact far \\nmore powerful.

And since no one is \\ngoing to see it except him, he omits any comments except the note-to-self variety. He works in a \\nsmall group perforce, because he either hasn't told anyone else about the idea yet, or it seems \\nso unpromising that no one else is allowed to work on it. Even if there is a group, they couldn't \\nhave multiple people editing the same code, because it changes too fast for that to be possible. \\nAnd the project starts small because the idea is small at first; he just has some cool hack he \\nwants to try out.\\nEven more striking are the number of officially sanctioned projects that manage to do all eight \\nthings wrong.

This works well for more parallelizable tasks, like fighting wars. For most \\nof history a well-drilled army of professional soldiers could be counted on to beat an army of \\nindividual warriors, no matter how valorous. But having ideas is not very parallelizable.

Should you take \\nit? You're about to hire your first employee. How much stock should you give him?\\nThese are some of the hardest questions founders face. And yet both have the same answer:\\n1/(1 - n)\\nWhenever you're trading stock in your company for anything, whether it's money or an \\nemployee or a deal with another company, the test for whether to do it is the same. You should \\ngive up n% of your company if what you trade it for improves your average outcome enough \\nt\", \"money or an \\nemployee or a deal with another company, the test for whether to do it is the same. You should \\ngive up n% of your company if what you trade it for improves your average outcome enough \\nthat the (100 - n)% you have left is worth more than the whole company was before.\\nFor example, if an investor wants to buy half your company, how much does that investment \\nhave to improve your average outcome for you to break even? Obviously it has to double: if you \\ntrade half your company for something that more than doubles the company's average \\noutcome, you're net ahead. You have half as big a share of something worth more than twice as \\nmuch.\\nIn the general case, if n is the fraction of the company you're giving up, the deal is a good one if \\nit makes the company worth more than 1/(1 - n).\\nFor example, suppose Y Combinator offers to fund you in return for 7% of your company. In this \\ncase, n is .07 and 1/(1 - n) is 1.075. So you should take the deal if you believe we can improve \\nyo\", \"n).\\nFor example, suppose Y Combinator offers to fund you in return for 7% of your company. In this \\ncase, n is .07 and 1/(1 - n) is 1.075. So you should take the deal if you believe we can improve \\nyour average outcome by more than 7.5%. If we improve your outcome by 10%, you're net \\nahead, because the remaining .93 you hold is worth .93 x 1.1 = 1.023. [1]\\nOne of the things the equity equation shows us is that, financially at least, taking money from a \\ntop VC firm can be a really good deal. Greg Mcadoo from Sequoia recently said at a YC dinner \\nthat when Sequoia invests alone they like to take about 30% of a company. 1/.7 = 1.43, \\nmeaning that deal is worth taking if they can improve your outcome by more than 43%. For the \\naverage startup, that would be an extraordinary bargain. It would improve the average startup's \\nprospects by more than 43% just to be able to say they were funded by Sequoia, even if they \\nnever actually got the money.\\nThe reason Sequoia is such a good deal is that\", \"improve the average startup's \\nprospects by more than 43% just to be able to say they were funded by Sequoia, even if they \\nnever actually got the money.\\nThe reason Sequoia is such a good deal is that the percentage of the company they take is \\nartificially low. They don't even try to get market price for their investment; they limit their \\nholdings to leave the founders enough stock to feel the company is still theirs.\\nThe catch is that Sequoia gets about 6000 business plans a year and funds about 20 of them, \\nso the odds of getting this great deal are 1 in 300. The companies that make it through are not \\naverage startups.\\nOf course, there are other factors to consider in a VC deal. It's never just a straight trade of \\nmoney for stock. But if it were, taking money from a top firm would generally be a bargain.\\nYou can use the same formula when giving stock to employees, but it works in the other \\ndirection. If i is the average outcome for the company with the addition of some new perso\", \"nerally be a bargain.\\nYou can use the same formula when giving stock to employees, but it works in the other \\ndirection. If i is the average outcome for the company with the addition of some new person, \\nthen they're worth n such that i = 1/(1 - n). Which means n = (i - 1)/i.\\nFor example, suppose you're just two founders and you want to hire an additional hacker who's \\nso good you feel he'll increase the average outcome of the whole company by 20%. n = (1.2 - \\n1)/1.2 = .167. So you'll break even if you trade 16.7% of the company for him.\\nThat doesn't mean 16.7% is the right amount of stock to give him. Stock is not the only cost of \\nhiring someone: there's usually salary and overhead as well. And if the company merely breaks \\neven on the deal, there's no reason to do it.\\nI think to translate salary and overhead into stock you should multiply the annual rate by about \\n1.5. Most startups grow fast or die; if you die you don't have to pay the guy, and if you grow fast \\nyou'll be paying ne\", 'te salary and overhead into stock you should multiply the annual rate by about \\n1.5. Most startups grow fast or die; if you die you don\\'t have to pay the guy, and if you grow fast \\nyou\\'ll be paying next year\\'s salary out of next year\\'s valuation, which should be 3x this year\\'s. If \\nyour valuation grows 3x a year, the total cost in stock of a new hire\\'s salary and overhead is 1.5 \\nyears\\' cost at the present valuation. [2]\\nHow much of an additional margin should the company need as the \"activation energy\" for the \\ndeal? Since this is in effect the company\\'s profit on a hire, the market will determine that: if \\nyou\\'re a hot opportunity, you can charge more.\\nLet\\'s run through an example. Suppose the company wants to make a \"profit\" of 50% on the \\nnew hire mentioned above. So subtract a third from 16.7% and we have 11.1% as his \"retail\" \\nprice. Suppose further that he\\'s going to cost $60k a year in salary and overhead, x 1.5 = $90k \\ntotal. If the company\\'s valuation is $2 million, $90k is 4', 'rom 16.7% and we have 11.1% as his \"retail\" \\nprice. Suppose further that he\\'s going to cost $60k a year in salary and overhead, x 1.5 = $90k \\ntotal. If the company\\'s valuation is $2 million, $90k is 4.5%. 11.1% - 4.5% = an offer of 6.6%.\\nIncidentally, notice how important it is for early employees to take little salary. It comes right out \\nof stock that could otherwise be given to them.\\nObviously there is a great deal of play in these numbers. I\\'m not claiming that stock grants can \\nnow be reduced to a formula. Ultimately you always have to guess. But at least know what \\nyou\\'re guessing. If you choose a number based on your gut feel, or a table of typical grant sizes \\nsupplied by a VC firm, understand what those are estimates of.\\nAnd more generally, when you make any decision involving equity, run it through 1/(1 - n) to see \\nif it makes sense. You should always feel richer after trading equity. If the trade didn\\'t increase \\nthe value of your remaining shares enough to put you net ahea', \"ity, run it through 1/(1 - n) to see \\nif it makes sense. You should always feel richer after trading equity. If the trade didn't increase \\nthe value of your remaining shares enough to put you net ahead, you wouldn't have (or \\nshouldn't have) done it.\\nNotes:\\n[1] This is why we can't believe anyone would think Y Combinator was a bad deal. Does anyone really think we're so \\nuseless that in three months we can't improve a startup's prospects by 7.5%? \\n[2] The obvious choice for your present valuation is the post-money valuation of your last funding round. This \\nprobably undervalues the company, though, because (a) unless your last round just happened, the company is \\npresumably worth more, and (b) the valuation of an early funding round usually reflects some other contribution by \\nthe investors.\\nThanks to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, Paul Buchheit, Hutch Fishman, David Hornik, Paul Kedrosky, Jessica \\nLivingston, Gary Sabot, and Joshua Schachter for reading drafts of this.\\nAn Alternative T\", \"s.\\nThanks to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, Paul Buchheit, Hutch Fishman, David Hornik, Paul Kedrosky, Jessica \\nLivingston, Gary Sabot, and Joshua Schachter for reading drafts of this.\\nAn Alternative Theory of Unions - # 76\\nMay 2007\\nPeople who worry about the increasing gap between rich and poor generally look back on the \\nmid twentieth century as a golden age.

I wouldn't quite call the high-paying \\nunion job a myth, but I think people who dwell on it are reading too much into it.\\nOddly enough, it was working with startups that made me realize where the high-paying union \\njob came from.

They also give valuable advice, because \\n(unlike VCs) many have been startup founders themselves.\\nGoogle's story shows the key role angels play. A lot of people know Google raised money from \\nKleiner and Sequoia. What most don't realize is how late. That VC round was a series B round; \\nthe premoney valuation was $75 million. Google was already a successful company at that \\npoint. Really, Google was fu\", 'Sequoia. What most don\\'t realize is how late. That VC round was a series B round; \\nthe premoney valuation was $75 million. Google was already a successful company at that \\npoint. Really, Google was funded with angel money.\\nIt may seem odd that the canonical Silicon Valley startup was funded by angels, but this is not \\nso surprising. Risk is always proportionate to reward. So the most successful startup of all is \\nlikely to have seemed an extremely risky bet at first, and that is exactly the kind VCs won\\'t \\ntouch.\\nWhere do angel investors come from? From other startups. So startup hubs like Silicon Valley \\nbenefit from something like the marketplace effect, but shifted in time: startups are there \\nbecause startups were there.\\n3. Angels don\\'t like publicity.\\nIf angels are so important, why do we hear more about VCs? Because VCs like publicity.

Because VCs like publicity. They \\nneed to market themselves to the investors who are their \"customers\"—the endowments and \\npension funds and rich families whose money they invest—and also to founders who might \\ncome to them for funding.\\nAngels don\\'t need to market themselves to investors because they invest their own money. Nor \\ndo they want to market themselves to founders: they don\\'t want random people pestering them \\nwith business plans. Actually, neither do VCs. Both angels and VCs get deals almost exclusively \\nthrough personal introductions. [2]\\nThe reason VCs want a strong brand is not to draw in more business plans over the transom, \\nbut so they win deals when competing against other VCs. Whereas angels are rarely in direct \\ncompetition, because (a) they do fewer deals, (b) they\\'re happy to split them, and (c) they invest \\nat a point where the stream is broader.\\n4.

Most investors, especially VCs, are not like founders.\\nSome angels are, or were, hackers. But most VCs are a different type of people: they're \\ndealmakers.\\nIf you're a hacker, here's a thought experiment you can run to understand why there are \\nbasically no hacker VCs: How would you like a job where you never got to make anything, but \\ninstead spent all your time listening to other people pitch (mostly terrible) projects, deciding \\nwhether to fund them, and sitting on their boards if you did? That would not be fun for most \\nhackers. Hackers like to make things. This would be like being an administrator.\\nBecause most VCs are a different species of people from founders, it's hard to know what \\nthey're thinking.

What they\\'re good at \\nis reading people, and making deals work to their advantage. Think twice before you try to beat \\nthem at that.\\n5. Most investors are momentum investors.\\nBecause most investors are dealmakers rather than technology people, they generally don\\'t \\nunderstand what you\\'re doing. I knew as a founder that most VCs didn\\'t get technology. I also \\nknew some made a lot of money. And yet it never occurred to me till recently to put those two \\nideas together and ask \"How can VCs make money by investing in stuff they don\\'t understand?\"\\nThe answer is that they\\'re like momentum investors. You can (or could once) make a lot of \\nmoney by noticing sudden changes in stock prices. When a stock jumps upward, you buy', ' they don\\'t understand?\"\\nThe answer is that they\\'re like momentum investors. You can (or could once) make a lot of \\nmoney by noticing sudden changes in stock prices. When a stock jumps upward, you buy, and \\nwhen it suddenly drops, you sell. In effect you\\'re insider trading, without knowing what you \\nknow. You just know someone knows something, and that\\'s making the stock move.\\nThis is how most venture investors operate. They don\\'t try to look at something and predict \\nwhether it will take off. They win by noticing that something is taking off a little sooner than \\neveryone else. That generates almost as good returns as actually being able to pick winners. \\nThey may have to pay a little more than they would if they got in at the very beginning, but only \\na little.\\nInvestors always say what they really care about is the team. Actually what they care most \\nabout is your traffic, then what other investors think, then the team. If you don\\'t yet have any \\ntraffic, they fall back on number 2,', 'they really care about is the team.

But all it takes is for one big investor to cool on \\nyou, and the next week no one will return your phone calls. We regularly have startups go from \\nhot to cold or cold to hot in a matter of days, and literally nothing has changed.\\nThere are two ways to deal with this phenomenon. If you\\'re feeling really confident, you can try \\nto ride it. You can start by asking a comparatively lowly VC for a small amount of money, and \\nthen after generating interest there, ask more prestigious VCs for larger amounts, stirring up a \\ncrescendo of buzz, and then \"sell\" at the top. This is extremely risky, an', 'small amount of money, and \\nthen after generating interest there, ask more prestigious VCs for larger amounts, stirring up a \\ncrescendo of buzz, and then \"sell\" at the top. This is extremely risky, and takes months even if \\nyou succeed. I wouldn\\'t try it myself. My advice is to err on the side of safety: when someone \\noffers you a decent deal, just take it and get on with building the company. Startups win or lose \\nbased on the quality of their product, not the quality of their funding deals.\\n6. Most investors are looking for big hits.\\nVenture investors like companies that could go public. That\\'s where the big returns are. They \\nknow the odds of any individual startup going public are small, but they want to invest in those \\nthat at least have a chance of going public.\\nCurrently the way VCs seem to operate is to invest in a bunch of companies, most of which fail, \\nand one of which is Google. Those few big wins compensate for losses on their other \\ninvestments. What this means is that m', \"s seem to operate is to invest in a bunch of companies, most of which fail, \\nand one of which is Google. Those few big wins compensate for losses on their other \\ninvestments. What this means is that most VCs will only invest in you if you're a potential \\nGoogle. They don't care about companies that are a safe bet to be acquired for $20 million. \\nThere needs to be a chance, however small, of the company becoming really big.\\nAngels are different in this respect. They're happy to invest in a company where the most likely \\noutcome is a $20 million acquisition if they can do it at a low enough valuation. But of course \\nthey like companies that could go public too. So having an ambitious long-term plan pleases \\neveryone.\\nIf you take VC money, you have to mean it, because the structure of VC deals prevents early \\nacquisitions. If you take VC money, they won't let you sell early.\\n7. VCs want to invest large amounts.\\nThe fact that they're running investment funds makes VCs want to invest large \", \"s prevents early \\nacquisitions. If you take VC money, they won't let you sell early.\\n7. VCs want to invest large amounts.\\nThe fact that they're running investment funds makes VCs want to invest large amounts. A \\ntypical VC fund is now hundreds of millions of dollars. If $400 million has to be invested by 10 \\npartners, they have to invest $40 million each. VCs usually sit on the boards of companies they \\nfund. If the average deal size was $1 million, each partner would have to sit on 40 boards, \\nwhich would not be fun. So they prefer bigger deals, where they can put a lot of money to work \\nat once.\\nVCs don't regard you as a bargain if you don't need a lot of money. That may even make you \\nless attractive, because it means their investment creates less of a barrier to entry for \\ncompetitors.\\nAngels are in a different position because they're investing their own money. They're happy to \\ninvest small amounts—sometimes as little as $20,000—as long as the potential returns look \\ngood enough.\", \"\\nAngels are in a different position because they're investing their own money. They're happy to \\ninvest small amounts—sometimes as little as $20,000—as long as the potential returns look \\ngood enough. So if you're doing something inexpensive, go to angels.\\n8. Valuations are fiction.\\nVCs admit that valuations are an artifact. They decide how much money you need and how \\nmuch of the company they want, and those two constraints yield a valuation.\\nValuations increase as the size of the investment does. A company that an angel is willing to \\nput $50,000 into at a valuation of a million can't take $6 million from VCs at that valuation. That \\nwould leave the founders less than a seventh of the company between them (since the option \\npool would also come out of that seventh). Most VCs wouldn't want that, which is why you never \\nhear of deals where a VC invests $6 million at a premoney valuation of $1 million.\\nIf valuations change depending on the amount invested, that shows how far they are fr\", \"t that, which is why you never \\nhear of deals where a VC invests $6 million at a premoney valuation of $1 million.\\nIf valuations change depending on the amount invested, that shows how far they are from \\nreflecting any kind of value of the company.\\nSince valuations are made up, founders shouldn't care too much about them. That's not the part \\nto focus on. In fact, a high valuation can be a bad thing. If you take funding at a premoney \\nvaluation of $10 million, you won't be selling the company for 20. You'll have to sell for over 50 \\nfor the VCs to get even a 5x return, which is low to them. More likely they'll want you to hold out \\nfor 100. But needing to get a high price decreases the chance of getting bought at all; many \\ncompanies can buy you for $10 million, but only a handful for 100. And since a startup is like a \\npass/fail course for the founders, what you want to optimize is your chance of a good outcome, \\nnot the percentage of the company you keep.\\nSo why do founders chase hig\", ' And since a startup is like a \\npass/fail course for the founders, what you want to optimize is your chance of a good outcome, \\nnot the percentage of the company you keep.\\nSo why do founders chase high valuations? They\\'re tricked by misplaced ambition. They feel \\nthey\\'ve achieved more if they get a higher valuation. They usually know other founders, and if \\nthey get a higher valuation they can say \"mine is bigger than yours.\" But funding is not the real \\ntest. The real test is the final outcome for the founder, and getting too high a valuation may just \\nmake a good outcome less likely.\\nThe one advantage of a high valuation is that you get less dilution. But there is another less \\nsexy way to achieve that: just take less money.\\n9. Investors look for founders like the current stars.\\nTen years ago investors were looking for the next Bill Gates.

The contribution of investors tends to be underestimated.\\nInvestors do more for startups than give them money.

The goal of the investors is for the \\ncompany to become valuable, and the company seems more valuable if it seems like all the \\ngood ideas came from within.\\nThis trend is compounded by the obsession that the press has with founders. In a company \\nfounded by two people, 10% of the ideas might come from the first guy they hire. Arguably \\nthey've done a bad job of hiring otherwise.

VCs are afraid of looking bad.\\nI've been very surprised to discover how timid most VCs are. They seem to be afraid of looking \\nbad to their partners, and perhaps also to the limited partners—the people whose money they \\ninvest.\\nYou can measure this fear in how much less risk VCs are willing to take. You can tell they won't \\nmake investments for their fund that they might be willing to make themselves as angels. \\nThough it's not quite accurate to say that VCs are less willing to take risks. They're less willing \\nto do things that might look bad.

Being turned down by investors doesn\\'t mean much.\\nSome founders are quite dejected when they get turned down by investors. They shouldn\\'t take \\nit so much to heart. To start with, investors are often wrong. It\\'s hard to think of a successful \\nstartup that wasn\\'t turned down by investors at some point. Lots of VCs rejected Google. So \\nobviously the reaction of investors is not a very meaningful test.\\nInvestors will often reject you for what seem to be superficial reasons. I read of one VC who \\nturned down a startup simply because they\\'d given away so many little bits of stock that the \\ndeal required too many signatures to close. [4] The reason investors can get away with this is \\nthat they see so many deals. It doesn\\'t matter if they underestimate you because of some \\nsurface imperfection, because the next best deal will be almost as good. Imagine picking out \\napples at a grocery store. You grab on', 'deals. It doesn\\'t matter if they underestimate you because of some \\nsurface imperfection, because the next best deal will be almost as good.

So when you get rejected by investors, \\ndon\\'t think \"we suck,\" but instead ask \"do we suck?\" Rejection is a question, not an answer.\\n13. Investors are emotional.\\nI\\'ve been surprised to discover how emotional investors can be. You\\'d expect them to be cold \\nand calculating, or at least businesslike, but often they\\'re not. I\\'m not sure if it\\'s their position of \\npower that makes them this way, or the large sums of money involved, but investment \\nnegotiations can easily turn personal. If you offend investors, they\\'ll leave in a huff.\\nA while ago an eminent VC firm offered a series A round', 'y, or the large sums of money involved, but investment \\nnegotiations can easily turn personal. If you offend investors, they\\'ll leave in a huff.\\nA while ago an eminent VC firm offered a series A round to a startup we\\'d seed funded. Then \\nthey heard a rival VC firm was also interested. They were so afraid that they\\'d be rejected in \\nfavor of this other firm that they gave the startup what\\'s known as an \"exploding termsheet.\" \\nThey had, I think, 24 hours to say yes or no, or the deal was off. Exploding termsheets are a \\nsomewhat dubious device, but not uncommon. What surprised me was their reaction when I \\ncalled to talk about it. I asked if they\\'d still be interested in the startup if the rival VC didn\\'t end \\nup making an offer, and they said no. What rational basis could they have had for saying that? If \\nthey thought the startup was worth investing in, what difference should it make what some other \\nVC thought?

If \\nthey thought the startup was worth investing in, what difference should it make what some other \\nVC thought?

But of course there was no rational basis for their \\ndecision. They just couldn't stand the idea of taking this rival firm's rejects.\\nIn this case the exploding termsheet was not (or not only) a tactic to pressure the startup. It was \\nmore like the high school trick of breaking up with someone before they can break up with you. \\nIn an earlier essay I said that VCs were a lot like high school girls. A few VCs have joked about \\nthat characterization, but none have disputed it.\\n14. The negotiation never stops till the closing.\\nMost deals, for investment or acquisition, happen in two phases.

The negotiation never stops till the closing.\\nMost deals, for investment or acquisition, happen in two phases. There's an initial phase of \\nnegotiation about the big questions. If this succeeds you get a termsheet, so called because it \\noutlines the key terms of a deal. A termsheet is not legally binding, but it is a definite step. It's \\nsupposed to mean that a deal is going to happen, once the lawyers work out all the details. In \\ntheory these details are minor ones; by definition all the important points are supposed to be \\ncovered in the termsheet.\\nInexperience and wishful thinking combine to make founders feel that when they have a \\ntermsheet, they have a deal. They want there to be a deal; everyone acts like they have a deal; \\nso there must be a deal. But there isn't and may not be for several months. A lot can change for \\na startup in several months.

Investors like to co-invest.\\nI've been surprised how willing investors are to split deals. You might think that if they found a \\ngood deal they'd want it all to themselves, but they seem positively eager to syndicate. This is \\nunderstandable with angels; they invest on a smaller scale and don't like to have too much \\nmoney tied up in any one deal. But VCs also share deals a lot. Why?\\nPartly I think this is an artifact of the rule I quoted earlier: after traffic, VCs care most what other \\nVCs think. A deal that has multiple VCs interested in it is more likely to close, so of deals that \\nclose, more will have multiple investors.\\nThere is one rational reason to want multiple VCs\", \"t other \\nVCs think. A deal that has multiple VCs interested in it is more likely to close, so of deals that \\nclose, more will have multiple investors.\\nThere is one rational reason to want multiple VCs in a deal: Any investor who co-invests with \\nyou is one less investor who could fund a competitor. Apparently Kleiner and Sequoia didn't like \\nsplitting the Google deal, but it did at least have the advantage, from each one's point of view, \\nthat there probably wouldn't be a competitor funded by the other. Splitting deals thus has similar \\nadvantages to confusing paternity.\\nBut I think the main reason VCs like splitting deals is the fear of looking bad. If another firm \\nshares the deal, then in the event of failure it will seem to have been a prudent choice—a \\nconsensus decision, rather than just the whim of an individual partner.\\n16.

I know personally of cases where one investor has talked \\nanother out of making a competitive offer, using the promise of sharing future deals.\\nIn principle investors are all competing for the same deals, but the spirit of cooperation is \\nstronger than the spirit of competition. The reason, again, is that there are so many deals. \\nThough a professional investor may have a closer relationship with a founder he invests in than \\nwith other investors, his relationship with the founder is only going to last a couple years, \\nwhereas his relationship with other firms will last his whole career.

They'd \\nrather lose the deal than establish a precedent of VCs competitively bidding against one \\nanother. An efficient startup funding market may be coming in the distant future; things tend to \\nmove in that direction; but it's certainly not here now. \\n17. Large-scale investors care about their portfolio, not any individual company.\\nThe reason startups work so well is that everyone with power also has equity. The only way any \\nof them can succeed is if they all do.

Close, but not \\nidentical. They don\\'t need any given startup to succeed, like founders do, just their portfolio as a \\nwhole to. So in borderline cases the rational thing for them to do is to sacrifice unpromising \\nstartups.\\nLarge-scale investors tend to put startups in three categories: successes, failures, and the \\n\"living dead\"—companies that are plugging along but don\\'t seem likely in the immediate future \\nto get bought or go public. To the founders, \"living dead\" sounds harsh. These companies may \\nbe far from failures by ordinary standards.

So if such a \\ncompany has two possible strategies, a conservative one that's slightly more likely to work in \\nthe end, or a risky one that within a short time will either yield a giant success or kill the \\ncompany, VCs will push for the kill-or-cure option. To them the company is already a write-off. \\nBetter to have resolution, one way or the other, as soon as possible.\\nIf a startup gets into real trouble, instead of trying to save it VCs may just sell it at a low price to \\nanother of their portfolio companies. Philip Greenspun said in Founders at Work that Ars \\nDigita's VCs did this to them.\\n18. Investors have different risk profiles from founders.\\nMost people would rather a 100% chance of $1 million than a 20% chance of $10 million. \\nInvestors are rich enough to be rational and prefer the latter.

So they'll always tend to \\nencourage founders to keep rolling the dice. If a company is doing well, investors will want \\nfounders to turn down most acquisition offers. And indeed, most startups that turn down \\nacquisition offers ultimately do better. But it's still hair-raising for the founders, because they \\nmight end up with nothing. When someone's offering to buy you for a price at which your stock \\nis worth $5 million, saying no is equivalent to having $5 million and betting it all on one spin of \\nthe roulette wheel.\\nInvestors will tell you the company is worth more.

That should correct the \\nproblem. Most founders have such low standards that they\\'ll feel rich with a sum that doesn\\'t \\nseem huge to investors. But this custom is spreading too slowly, because VCs are afraid of \\nseeming irresponsible. No one wants to be the first VC to give someone fuck-you money and \\nthen actually get told \"fuck you.\" But until this does start to happen, we know VCs are being too \\nconservative.\\n19. Investors vary greatly.\\nBack when I was a founder I used to think all VCs were the same. And in fact they do all look \\nthe same. They\\'re all what hackers call \"suits.\" But since I\\'ve been dealing with VCs more I\\'ve \\nlearned that some suits are smarter than others.\\nThey\\'re also in a business where winners tend to keep winning and losers to keep losing.

When \\na VC firm has been successful in the past, everyone wants funding from them, so they get the \\npick of all the new deals. The self-reinforcing nature of the venture funding market means that \\nthe top ten firms live in a completely different world from, say, the hundredth. As well as being \\nsmarter, they tend to be calmer and more upstanding; they don\\'t need to do iffy things to get an \\nedge, and don\\'t want to because they have more brand to protect.\\nThere are only two kinds of VCs you want to take money from, if you have the luxury of \\nchoosing: the \"top tier\" VCs, meaning about the top 20 or so firms, plus a few new ones that are \\nnot among the top 20 only because they haven\\'t been around long enough.\\nIt\\'s particularly important to raise money from a top firm if you\\'re a hacker, because they\\'re \\nmore confident.

Investors don't realize how much it costs to raise money from them.\\nRaising money is a huge time suck at just the point where startups can least afford it. It's not \\nunusual for it to take five or six months to close a funding round. Six weeks is fast. And raising \\nmoney is not just something you can leave running as a background process. When you're \\nraising money, it's inevitably the main focus of the company.

Since demo day \\noccurs after 10 weeks, the company is now 18 weeks old. Raising money, rather than working \\non the product, has been the company's main focus for 44% of its existence. And mind you, this \\nan example where things turned out well.\\nWhen a startup does return to working on the product after a funding round finally closes, it's as \\nif they were returning to work after a months-long illness. They've lost most of their momentum.\\nInvestors have no idea how much they damage the companies they invest in by taking so long \\nto do it. But companies do. So there is a big opportunity here for a new kind of venture fund that \\ninvests smaller amounts at lower valuations, but promises to either close or say no very quickly. \\nIf there were such a firm, I'd recommend it to startups in preference to any other, no matter h\", \"that \\ninvests smaller amounts at lower valuations, but promises to either close or say no very quickly. \\nIf there were such a firm, I'd recommend it to startups in preference to any other, no matter how \\nprestigious. Startups live on speed and momentum.\\n21. Investors don't like to say no.\\nThe reason funding deals take so long to close is mainly that investors can't make up their \\nminds. VCs are not big companies; they can do a deal in 24 hours if they need to. But they \\nusually let the initial meetings stretch out over a couple weeks. The reason is the selection \\nalgorithm I mentioned earlier. Most don't try to predict whether a startup will win, but to notice \\nquickly that it already is winning. They care what the market thinks of you and what other VCs \\nthink of you, and they can't judge those just from meeting you.\\nBecause they're investing in things that (a) change fast and (b) they don't understand, a lot of \\ninvestors will reject you in a way that can later be claimed not to have\", ' those just from meeting you.\\nBecause they\\'re investing in things that (a) change fast and (b) they don\\'t understand, a lot of \\ninvestors will reject you in a way that can later be claimed not to have been a rejection. Unless \\nyou know this world, you may not even realize you\\'ve been rejected. Here\\'s a VC saying no: \\nWe\\'re really excited about your project, and we want to keep in close touch as you develop it \\nfurther. Translated into more straightforward language, this means: We\\'re not investing in you, \\nbut we may change our minds if it looks like you\\'re taking off. Sometimes they\\'re more candid \\nand say explicitly that they need to \"see some traction.\" They\\'ll invest in you if you start to get \\nlots of users. But so would any VC. So all they\\'re saying is that you\\'re still at square 1.\\nHere\\'s a test for deciding whether a VC\\'s response was yes or no. Look down at your hands. \\nAre you holding a termsheet?\\n22.

Practically every successful startup takes outside investment at some point.\\nWhy? What the people who think they don\\'t need investors forget is that they will have \\ncompetitors. The question is not whether you need outside investment, but whether it could help \\nyou at all. If the answer is yes, and you don\\'t take investment, then competitors who do will have \\nan advantage over you. And in the startup world a little advantage can expand into a lot.\\nMike Moritz famously said that he invested in Yahoo because he thought they had a few weeks\\' \\nlead over their competitors.

There are certainly costs to raising money. But as \\nof this writing the empirical evidence says it\\'s a net win.\\n23. Investors like it when you don\\'t need them.\\nA lot of founders approach investors as if they needed their permission to start a company—as \\nif it were like getting into college. But you don\\'t need investors to start most companies; they just \\nmake it easier.\\nAnd in fact, investors greatly prefer it if you don\\'t need them.

Sometimes judging you correctly is the end \\ngoal. But there's a second much more common type of judgement where it isn't. We tend to \\nregard all judgements of us as the first type. We'd probably be happier if we realized which are \\nand which aren't.\\nThe first type of judgement, the type where judging you is the end goal, include court cases, \\ngrades in classes, and most competitions. Such judgements can of course be mistaken, but \\nbecause the goal is to judge you correctly, there's usually some kind of appeals process. If you \\nfeel you've been misjudged, you can protest that you've been treated unfairly.\\nNearly all the judgements made on children are \", \"udge you correctly, there's usually some kind of appeals process. If you \\nfeel you've been misjudged, you can protest that you've been treated unfairly.\\nNearly all the judgements made on children are of this type, so we get into the habit early in life \\nof thinking that all judgements are.\\nBut in fact there is a second much larger class of judgements where judging you is only a \\nmeans to something else. These include college admissions, hiring and investment decisions, \\nand of course the judgements made in dating. This kind of judgement is not really about you.\\nPut yourself in the position of someone selecting players for a national team. Suppose for the \\nsake of simplicity that this is a game with no positions, and that you have to select 20 players. \\nThere will be a few stars who clearly should make the team, and many players who clearly \\nshouldn't. The only place your judgement makes a difference is in the borderline cases. \\nSuppose you screw up and underestimate the 20th best playe\", \" should make the team, and many players who clearly \\nshouldn't. The only place your judgement makes a difference is in the borderline cases. \\nSuppose you screw up and underestimate the 20th best player, causing him not to make the \\nteam, and his place to be taken by the 21st best. You've still picked a good team. If the players \\nhave the usual distribution of ability, the 21st best player will be only slightly worse than the 20th \\nbest. Probably the difference between them will be less than the measurement error.\\nThe 20th best player may feel he has been misjudged. But your goal here wasn't to provide a \\nservice estimating people's ability. It was to pick a team, and if the difference between the 20th \\nand 21st best players is less than the measurement error, you've still done that optimally.\\nIt's a false analogy even to use the word unfair to describe this kind of misjudgement. It's not \\naimed at producing a correct estimate of any given individual, but at selecting a reasonably \\nopti\", \"ly.\\nIt's a false analogy even to use the word unfair to describe this kind of misjudgement. It's not \\naimed at producing a correct estimate of any given individual, but at selecting a reasonably \\noptimal set.\\nOne thing that leads us astray here is that the selector seems to be in a position of power. That \\nmakes him seem like a judge. If you regard someone judging you as a customer instead of a \\njudge, the expectation of fairness goes away. The author of a good novel wouldn't complain that \\nreaders were unfair for preferring a potboiler with a racy cover. Stupid, perhaps, but not unfair.\\nOur early training and our self-centeredness combine to make us believe that every judgement \\nof us is about us. In fact most aren't. This is a rare case where being less self-centered will \\nmake people more confident. Once you realize how little most people judging you care about \\njudging you accurately—once you realize that because of the normal distribution of most \\napplicant pools, it matters least\", \"re confident. Once you realize how little most people judging you care about \\njudging you accurately—once you realize that because of the normal distribution of most \\napplicant pools, it matters least to judge accurately in precisely the cases where judgement has \\nthe most effect—you won't take rejection so personally.\\nAnd curiously enough, taking rejection less personally may help you to get rejected less often. If \\nyou think someone judging you will work hard to judge you correctly, you can afford to be \\npassive. But the more you realize that most judgements are greatly influenced by random, \\nextraneous factors—that most people judging you are more like a fickle novel buyer than a wise \\nand perceptive magistrate—the more you realize you can do things to influence the outcome.\\nOne good place to apply this principle is in college applications. Most high school students \\napplying to college do it with the usual child's mix of inferiority and self-centeredness: inferiority \\nin that they \", 'ace to apply this principle is in college applications. Most high school students \\napplying to college do it with the usual child\\'s mix of inferiority and self-centeredness: inferiority \\nin that they assume that admissions committees must be all-seeing; self-centeredness in that \\nthey assume admissions committees care enough about them to dig down into their application \\nand figure out whether they\\'re good or not. These combine to make applicants passive in \\napplying and hurt when they\\'re rejected. If college applicants realized how quick and \\nimpersonal most selection processes are, they\\'d make more effort to sell themselves, and take \\nthe outcome less personally.\\nMicrosoft is Dead - # 73\\nApril 2007\\nA few days ago I suddenly realized Microsoft was dead.

I \\ncan remember when it was IBM before them. I mostly ignored this shadow. I never used \\nMicrosoft software, so it only affected me indirectly—for example, in the spam I got from \\nbotnets. And because I wasn\\'t paying attention, I didn\\'t notice when the shadow disappeared.\\nBut it\\'s gone now. I can sense that. No one is even afraid of Microsoft anymore.

No one is even afraid of Microsoft anymore. They still make \\na lot of money—so does IBM, for that matter. But they're not dangerous.\\nWhen did Microsoft die, and of what? I know they seemed dangerous as late as 2001, because \\nI wrote an essay then about how they were less dangerous than they seemed. I'd guess they \\nwere dead by 2005. I know when we started Y Combinator we didn't worry about Microsoft as \\ncompetition for the startups we funded. In fact, we've never even invited them to the demo days \\nwe organize for startups to present to investors. We invite Yahoo and Google and some other \\nInternet companies, but we've never bothered to invite Microsoft. Nor has anyone there ever \\neven sent us an email. They're in a different world.\\nWhat killed them? Four things, I think, all of them occurring simultaneously in the mid 2000s.\\nThe most obvious is Google.

Four things, I think, all of them occurring simultaneously in the mid 2000s.\\nThe most obvious is Google. There can only be one big man in town, and they\\'re clearly it. \\nGoogle is the most dangerous company now by far, in both the good and bad senses of the \\nword. Microsoft can at best limp along afterward.\\nWhen did Google take the lead? There will be a tendency to push it back to their IPO in August \\n2004, but they weren\\'t setting the terms of the debate then. I\\'d say they took the lead in 2005. \\nGmail was one of the things that put them over the edge. Gmail showed they could do more \\nthan search.\\nGmail also showed how much you could do with web-based software, if you took advantage of \\nwhat later came to be called \"Ajax.\" And that was the second cause of Microsoft\\'s death: \\neveryone can see the desktop is over.

The x in Ajax is from the \\nXMLHttpRequest object, which lets the browser communicate with the server in the background \\nwhile displaying a page. (Originally the only way to communicate with the server was to ask for \\na new page.) XMLHttpRequest was created by Microsoft in the late 90s because they needed it \\nfor Outlook. What they didn't realize was that it would be useful to a lot of other people too—in \\nfact, to anyone who wanted to make web apps work like desktop ones.\\nThe other critical component of Ajax is Javascript, the programming language that runs in the \\nbrowser.

Anyone who cares can have fast \\nInternet access now. And the bigger the pipe to the server, the less you need the desktop.\\nThe last nail in the coffin came, of all places, from Apple. Thanks to OS X, Apple has come \\nback from the dead in a way that is extremely rare in technology.

They were like Nero or Commodus—evil in the way only inherited \\npower can make you. Because remember, the Microsoft monopoly didn\\'t begin with Microsoft. \\nThey got it from IBM. The software business was overhung by a monopoly from about the \\nmid-1950s to about 2005. For practically its whole existence, that is. One of the reasons \"Web \\n2.0\" has such an air of euphoria about it is the feeling, conscious or not, that this era of \\nmonopoly may finally be over.\\nOf course, as a hacker I can\\'t help thinking about how something broken could be fixed.

Three have been acquired: Reddit was a merger of two, Reddit and \\nInfogami, and a third was acquired that we can't talk about yet. Another from that batch was \\nLoopt, which is doing so well they could probably be acquired in about ten minutes if they \\nwanted to.\\nSo about half the founders from that first summer, less than two years ago, are now rich, at \\nleast by their standards. (One thing you learn when you get rich is that there are many degrees \\nof it.)\\nI'm not ready to predict our success rate will stay as high as 50%. That first batch could have \\nbeen an anomaly. But we should be able to do better than the oft-quoted (and probably made \\nup) standard figure of 10%. \", \"predict our success rate will stay as high as 50%. That first batch could have \\nbeen an anomaly. But we should be able to do better than the oft-quoted (and probably made \\nup) standard figure of 10%.

In two cases the founders just went on to do other things at the \\nend of the summer. I don't think they were traumatized by the experience. The closest to a \\ntraumatic failure was Kiko, whose founders kept working on their startup for a whole year before \\nbeing squashed by Google Calendar. But they ended up happy. They sold their software on \\neBay for a quarter of a million dollars. After they paid back their angel investors, they had about \\na year's salary each.

Whatever our long-term success rate \\nends up being, I think the rate of people who wish they'd gotten a regular job will stay close to \\n0%.\\nThe big mystery to me is: why don't more people start startups? If nearly everyone who does it \\nprefers it to a regular job, and a significant percentage get rich, why doesn't everyone want to \\ndo this? A lot of people think we get thousands of applications for each funding cycle. In fact we \\nusually only get several hundred. Why don't more people apply?

The great majority of programmers \\nstill go straight from college to cubicle, and stay there.\\nIt seems like people are not acting in their own interest. What's going on? Well, I can answer \\nthat. Because of Y Combinator's position at the very start of the venture funding process, we're \\nprobably the world's leading experts on the psychology of people who aren't sure if they want to \\nstart a company.\\nThere's nothing wrong with being unsure. If you're a hacker thinking about starting a startup \\nand hesitating before taking the leap, you're part of a grand tradition. Larry and Sergey seem to \\nhave felt the same before they started Google, and so did Jerry and Filo before they started \\nYahoo. In fact, I'd guess the most successful startups are the ones \", \" tradition. Larry and Sergey seem to \\nhave felt the same before they started Google, and so did Jerry and Filo before they started \\nYahoo. In fact, I'd guess the most successful startups are the ones started by uncertain hackers \\nrather than gung-ho business guys.\\nWe have some evidence to support this. Several of the most successful startups we've funded \\ntold us later that they only decided to apply at the last moment. Some decided only hours \\nbefore the deadline.\\nThe way to deal with uncertainty is to analyze it into components. Most people who are \\nreluctant to do something have about eight different reasons mixed together in their heads, and \\ndon't know themselves which are biggest. Some will be justified and some bogus, but unless \\nyou know the relative proportion of each, you don't know whether your overall uncertainty is \\nmostly justified or mostly bogus.\\nSo I'm going to list all the components of people's reluctance to start startups, and explain \\nwhich are real. Then would-be \", 'now whether your overall uncertainty is \\nmostly justified or mostly bogus.\\nSo I\\'m going to list all the components of people\\'s reluctance to start startups, and explain \\nwhich are real.

But there are two things different here from \\nthe usual confidence-building exercise. One is that I\\'m motivated to be honest. Most people in \\nthe confidence-building business have already achieved their goal when you buy the book or \\npay to attend the seminar where they tell you how great you are. Whereas if I encourage people \\nto start startups who shouldn\\'t, I make my own life worse. If I encourage too many people to \\napply to Y Combinator, it just means more work for me, because I have to read all the \\napplications.\\nThe other thing that\\'s going to be different is my approach.

We\\'ll start with \\nthe one everyone\\'s born with.\\n1. Too young\\nA lot of people think they\\'re too young to start a startup. Many are right. The median age \\nworldwide is about 27, so probably a third of the population can truthfully say they\\'re too young.\\nWhat\\'s too young? One of our goals with Y Combinator was to discover the lower bound on the \\nage of startup founders. It always seemed to us that investors were too conservative here—that \\nthey wanted to fund professors, when really they should be funding grad students or even \\nundergrads.\\nThe main thing we\\'ve discovered from pushing the edge of this envelope is not where the edge \\nis, but how fuzzy it is. The outer limit m', 'eally they should be funding grad students or even \\nundergrads.\\nThe main thing we\\'ve discovered from pushing the edge of this envelope is not where the edge \\nis, but how fuzzy it is. The outer limit may be as low as 16. We don\\'t look beyond 18 because \\npeople younger than that can\\'t legally enter into contracts. But the most successful founder \\nwe\\'ve funded so far, Sam Altman, was 19 at the time.\\nSam Altman, however, is an outlying data point. When he was 19, he seemed like he had a 40 \\nyear old inside him. There are other 19 year olds who are 12 inside.\\nThere\\'s a reason we have a distinct word \"adult\" for people over a certain age. There is a \\nthreshold you cross. It\\'s conventionally fixed at 21, but different people cross it at greatly varying \\nages. You\\'re old enough to start a startup if you\\'ve crossed this threshold, whatever your age.\\nHow do you tell? There are a couple tests adults use. I realized these tests existed after \\nmeeting Sam Altman, actually. I noticed that I felt lik', 'if you\\'ve crossed this threshold, whatever your age.\\nHow do you tell? There are a couple tests adults use. I realized these tests existed after \\nmeeting Sam Altman, actually. I noticed that I felt like I was talking to someone much older. \\nAfterward I wondered, what am I even measuring? What made him seem older?\\nOne test adults use is whether you still have the kid flake reflex. When you\\'re a little kid and \\nyou\\'re asked to do something hard, you can cry and say \"I can\\'t do it\" and the adults will \\nprobably let you off. As a kid there\\'s a magic button you can press by saying \"I\\'m just a kid\" that \\nwill get you out of most difficult situations. Whereas adults, by definition, are not allowed to \\nflake. They still do, of course, but when they do they\\'re ruthlessly pruned.\\nThe other way to tell an adult is by how they react to a challenge. Someone who\\'s not yet an \\nadult will tend to respond to a challenge from an adult in a way that acknowledges their \\ndominance. If an adult says \"that\\'s ', 'l an adult is by how they react to a challenge. Someone who\\'s not yet an \\nadult will tend to respond to a challenge from an adult in a way that acknowledges their \\ndominance. If an adult says \"that\\'s a stupid idea,\" a kid will either crawl away with his tail \\nbetween his legs, or rebel. But rebelling presumes inferiority as much as submission. The adult \\nresponse to \"that\\'s a stupid idea,\" is simply to look the other person in the eye and say \"Really? \\nWhy do you think so?\"\\nThere are a lot of adults who still react childishly to challenges, of course. What you don\\'t often \\nfind are kids who react to challenges like adults. When you do, you\\'ve found an adult, whatever \\ntheir age.\\n2. Too inexperienced\\nI once wrote that startup founders should be at least 23, and that people should work for \\nanother company for a few years before starting their own. I no longer believe that, and what \\nchanged my mind is the example of the startups we\\'ve funded.\\nI still think 23 is a better age than 21. Bu', \"another company for a few years before starting their own. I no longer believe that, and what \\nchanged my mind is the example of the startups we've funded.\\nI still think 23 is a better age than 21. But the best way to get experience if you're 21 is to start a \\nstartup. So, paradoxically, if you're too inexperienced to start a startup, what you should do is \\nstart one. That's a way more efficient cure for inexperience than a normal job. In fact, getting a \\nnormal job may actually make you less able to start a startup, by turning you into a tame animal \\nwho thinks he needs an office to work in and a product manager to tell him what software to \\nwrite.\\nWhat really convinced me of this was the Kikos. They started a startup right out of college. \\nTheir inexperience caused them to make a lot of mistakes. But by the time we funded their \\nsecond startup, a year later, they had become extremely formidable. They were certainly not \\ntame animals. And there is no way they'd have grown so much if t\", \"mistakes. But by the time we funded their \\nsecond startup, a year later, they had become extremely formidable. They were certainly not \\ntame animals. And there is no way they'd have grown so much if they'd spent that year working \\nat Microsoft, or even Google. They'd still have been diffident junior programmers.\\nSo now I'd advise people to go ahead and start startups right out of college. There's no better \\ntime to take risks than when you're young. Sure, you'll probably fail. But even failure will get you \\nto the ultimate goal faster than getting a job.\\nIt worries me a bit to be saying this, because in effect we're advising people to educate \\nthemselves by failing at our expense, but it's the truth.\\n3. Not determined enough\\nYou need a lot of determination to succeed as a startup founder. It's probably the single best \\npredictor of success.\\nSome people may not be determined enough to make it. It's hard for me to say for sure, \\nbecause I'm so determined that I can't imagine what's going\", \"It's probably the single best \\npredictor of success.\\nSome people may not be determined enough to make it. It's hard for me to say for sure, \\nbecause I'm so determined that I can't imagine what's going on in the heads of people who \\naren't.

I can think of several we've funded who would \\nhave been delighted at first to be bought for $2 million, but are now set on world domination.\\nHow can you tell if you're determined enough, when Larry and Sergey themselves were unsure \\nat first about starting a company? I'm guessing here, but I'd say the test is whether you're \\nsufficiently driven to work on your own projects. Though they may have been unsure whether \\nthey wanted to start a company, it doesn't seem as if Larry and Sergey were meek little \\nresearch assistants, obediently doing their advisors' bidding. They started projects\", \" have been unsure whether \\nthey wanted to start a company, it doesn't seem as if Larry and Sergey were meek little \\nresearch assistants, obediently doing their advisors' bidding.

If you're smart enough to worry that you might not be \\nsmart enough to start a startup, you probably are.\\nAnd in any case, starting a startup just doesn't require that much intelligence. Some startups \\ndo. You have to be good at math to write Mathematica. But most companies do more mundane \\nstuff where the decisive factor is effort, not brains. Silicon Valley can warp your perspective on \\nthis, because there's a cult of smartness here. People who aren't smart at least try to act that \\nway. But if you think it takes a lot of intelligence to get rich, try spending a couple days in some \\nof the fancier bits of New York or LA.\\nIf y\", \"ere.

But if you think it takes a lot of intelligence to get rich, try spending a couple days in some \\nof the fancier bits of New York or LA.\\nIf you don't think you're smart enough to start a startup doing something technically difficult, just \\nwrite enterprise software. Enterprise software companies aren't technology companies, they're \\nsales companies, and sales depends mostly on effort.\\n5. Know nothing about business\\nThis is another variable whose coefficient should be zero. You don't need to know anything \\nabout business to start a startup. The initial focus should be the product. All you need to know \\nin this phase is how to build things people want. If you succeed, you'll have to think about how \\nto make money from it. But this is so easy you can pick it up on the fly.\\nI get a fair amount of flak for telling founders just to make something great and not worry too \\nmuch about making money. And yet all the empirical evidence poi\", \" so easy you can pick it up on the fly.\\nI get a fair amount of flak for telling founders just to make something great and not worry too \\nmuch about making money. And yet all the empirical evidence points that way: pretty much \\n100% of startups that make something popular manage to make money from it. And acquirers \\ntell me privately that revenue is not what they buy startups for, but their strategic value. Which \\nmeans, because they made something people want. Acquirers know the rule holds for them too: \\nif users love you, you can always make money from that somehow, and if they don't, the \\ncleverest business model in the world won't save you.\\nSo why do so many people argue with me? I think one reason is that they hate the idea that a \\nbunch of twenty year olds could get rich from building something cool that doesn't make any \\nmoney. They just don't want that to be possible. But how possible it is doesn't depend on how \\nmuch they want it to be.\\nFor a while it annoyed me to hear myself \", \" something cool that doesn't make any \\nmoney. They just don't want that to be possible. But how possible it is doesn't depend on how \\nmuch they want it to be.\\nFor a while it annoyed me to hear myself described as some kind of irresponsible pied piper, \\nleading impressionable young hackers down the road to ruin. But now I realize this kind of \\ncontroversy is a sign of a good idea.\\nThe most valuable truths are the ones most people don't believe. They're like undervalued \\nstocks. If you start with them, you'll have the whole field to yourself. So when you find an idea \\nyou know is good but most people disagree with, you should not merely ignore their objections, \\nbut push aggressively in that direction. In this case, that means you should seek out ideas that \\nwould be popular but seem hard to make money from.\\nWe'll bet a seed round you can't make something popular that we can't figure out how to make \\nmoney from.\\n6.

No cofounder\\nNot having a cofounder is a real problem. A startup is too much for one person to bear. And \\nthough we differ from other investors on a lot of questions, we all agree on this. All investors, \\nwithout exception, are more likely to fund you with a cofounder than without.\\nWe've funded two single founders, but in both cases we suggested their first priority should be \\nto find a cofounder. Both did. But we'd have preferred them to have cofounders before they \\napplied. It's not super hard to get a cofounder for a project that's just been funded, and we'd \\nrather have cofounders committed enough to sign up for something super hard.\\nIf you don't have a cofounder, what should you do? Get one. It's more important than anything \\nelse. If there's no one where you live who wants to start a startup with you, move where there \\nare people who do. If no one wants t\", \"er, what should you do? Get one. It's more important than anything \\nelse. If there's no one where you live who wants to start a startup with you, move where there \\nare people who do. If no one wants to work with you on your current idea, switch to an idea \\npeople want to work on.\\nIf you're still in school, you're surrounded by potential cofounders. A few years out it gets harder \\nto find them. Not only do you have a smaller pool to draw from, but most already have jobs, and \\nperhaps even families to support. So if you had friends in college you used to scheme about \\nstartups with, stay in touch with them as well as you can. That may help keep the dream alive.\\nIt's possible you could meet a cofounder through something like a user's group or a conference. \\nBut I wouldn't be too optimistic. You need to work with someone to know whether you want \\nthem as a cofounder. [2]\\nThe real lesson to draw from this is not how to find a cofounder, but that you should start \\nstartups when you're young \", 'ou need to work with someone to know whether you want \\nthem as a cofounder. [2]\\nThe real lesson to draw from this is not how to find a cofounder, but that you should start \\nstartups when you\\'re young and there are lots of them around.\\n7. No idea\\nIn a sense, it\\'s not a problem if you don\\'t have a good idea, because most startups change their \\nidea anyway. In the average Y Combinator startup, I\\'d guess 70% of the idea is new at the end \\nof the first three months. Sometimes it\\'s 100%.\\nIn fact, we\\'re so sure the founders are more important than the initial idea that we\\'re going to try \\nsomething new this funding cycle. We\\'re going to let people apply with no idea at all. If you \\nwant, you can answer the question on the application form that asks what you\\'re going to do \\nwith \"We have no idea.\" If you seem really good we\\'ll accept you anyway. We\\'re confident we \\ncan sit down with you and cook up some promising project.\\nReally this just codifies what we do already. We put little weight on th', \" If you seem really good we'll accept you anyway. We're confident we \\ncan sit down with you and cook up some promising project.\\nReally this just codifies what we do already. We put little weight on the idea. We ask mainly out \\nof politeness. The kind of question on the application form that we really care about is the one \\nwhere we ask what cool things you've made. If what you've made is version one of a promising \\nstartup, so much the better, but the main thing we care about is whether you're good at making \\nthings. Being lead developer of a popular open source project counts almost as much.\\nThat solves the problem if you get funded by Y Combinator. What about in the general case? \\nBecause in another sense, it is a problem if you don't have an idea. If you start a startup with no \\nidea, what do you do next?\\nSo here's the brief recipe for getting startup ideas. Find something that's missing in your own \\nlife, and supply that need—no matter how specific to you it seems. Steve Wozniak bu\", 'hat do you do next?\\nSo here\\'s the brief recipe for getting startup ideas. Find something that\\'s missing in your own \\nlife, and supply that need—no matter how specific to you it seems.

No room for more startups\\nA lot of people look at the ever-increasing number of startups and think \"this can\\'t continue.\" \\nImplicit in their thinking is a fallacy: that there is some limit on the number of startups there \\ncould be. But this is false. No one claims there\\'s any limit on the number of people who can \\nwork for salary at 1000-person companies. Why should there be any limit on the number who \\nc', \"artups there \\ncould be. But this is false. No one claims there's any limit on the number of people who can \\nwork for salary at 1000-person companies. Why should there be any limit on the number who \\ncan work for equity at 5-person companies? [3]\\nNearly everyone who works is satisfying some kind of need. Breaking up companies into \\nsmaller units doesn't make those needs go away. Existing needs would probably get satisfied \\nmore efficiently by a network of startups than by a few giant, hierarchical organizations, but I \\ndon't think that would mean less opportunity, because satisfying current needs would lead to \\nmore. Certainly this tends to be the case in individuals. Nor is there anything wrong with that. \\nWe take for granted things that medieval kings would have considered effeminate luxuries, like \\nwhole buildings heated to spring temperatures year round. And if things go well, our \\ndescendants will take for granted things we would consider shockingly luxurious. There is no \\nabsolute\", 'ries, like \\nwhole buildings heated to spring temperatures year round. And if things go well, our \\ndescendants will take for granted things we would consider shockingly luxurious. There is no \\nabsolute standard for material wealth. Health care is a component of it, and that alone is a black \\nhole. For the foreseeable future, people will want ever more material wealth, so there is no limit \\nto the amount of work available for companies, and for startups in particular.\\nUsually the limited-room fallacy is not expressed directly. Usually it\\'s implicit in statements like \\n\"there are only so many startups Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo can buy.\" Maybe, though the list \\nof acquirers is a lot longer than that. And whatever you think of other acquirers, Google is not \\nstupid. The reason big companies buy startups is that they\\'ve created something valuable. And \\nwhy should there be any limit to the number of valuable startups companies can acquire, any \\nmore than there is a limit to the amount of w', \"buy startups is that they've created something valuable. And \\nwhy should there be any limit to the number of valuable startups companies can acquire, any \\nmore than there is a limit to the amount of wealth individual people want? Maybe there would \\nbe practical limits on the number of startups any one acquirer could assimilate, but if there is \\nvalue to be had, in the form of upside that founders are willing to forgo in return for an \\nimmediate payment, acquirers will evolve to consume it. Markets are pretty smart that way.\\n9. Family to support\\nThis one is real. I wouldn't advise anyone with a family to start a startup. I'm not saying it's a \\nbad idea, just that I don't want to take responsibility for advising it. I'm willing to take \\nresponsibility for telling 22 year olds to start startups. So what if they fail? They'll learn a lot, and \\nthat job at Microsoft will still be waiting for them if they need it. But I'm not prepared to cross \\nmoms.\\nWhat you can do, if you have a family and\", 'ps. So what if they fail? They\\'ll learn a lot, and \\nthat job at Microsoft will still be waiting for them if they need it. But I\\'m not prepared to cross \\nmoms.\\nWhat you can do, if you have a family and want to start a startup, is start a consulting business \\nyou can then gradually turn into a product business. Empirically the chances of pulling that off \\nseem very small. You\\'re never going to produce Google this way. But at least you\\'ll never be \\nwithout an income.\\nAnother way to decrease the risk is to join an existing startup instead of starting your own. \\nBeing one of the first employees of a startup is a lot like being a founder, in both the good ways \\nand the bad. You\\'ll be roughly 1/n^2 founder, where n is your employee number.\\nAs with the question of cofounders, the real lesson here is to start startups when you\\'re young.\\n10.

I know this business well enough \\nto know you can\\'t do it half-heartedly. What makes a good startup founder so dangerous is his \\nwillingness to endure infinite schleps.\\nThere is a bit of a problem with retirement, though. Like a lot of people, I like to work. And one \\nof the many weird little problems you discover when you get rich is that a lot of the interesting \\npeople you\\'d like to work with are not rich. They need to work at something that pays the bills. \\nWhich means if you want to have them as colleagues, you have to work at somethin', \"t of the interesting \\npeople you'd like to work with are not rich.

I think this is what drives a lot of serial \\nentrepreneurs, actually.\\nThat's why I love working on Y Combinator so much. It's an excuse to work on something \\ninteresting with people I like.\\n11. Not ready for commitment\\nThis was my reason for not starting a startup for most of my twenties. Like a lot of people that \\nage, I valued freedom most of all. I was reluctant to do anything that required a commitment of \\nmore than a few months. Nor would I have wanted to do anything that completely took over my \\nlife the way a startup does. And that's fine. If you want to spend your time travelling around, or \\nplaying in a band, or whatever, that's a perfectly legitimate reason not to start a company.\\nIf you start a startup that succeeds, it'\", \"hat's fine. If you want to spend your time travelling around, or \\nplaying in a band, or whatever, that's a perfectly legitimate reason not to start a company.\\nIf you start a startup that succeeds, it's going to consume at least three or four years. (If it fails, \\nyou'll be done a lot quicker.) So you shouldn't do it if you're not ready for commitments on that \\nscale. Be aware, though, that if you get a regular job, you'll probably end up working there for as \\nlong as a startup would take, and you'll find you have much less spare time than you might \\nexpect. So if you're ready to clip on that ID badge and go to that orientation session, you may \\nalso be ready to start that startup.\\n12. Need for structure\\nI'm told there are people who need structure in their lives. This seems to be a nice way of \\nsaying they need someone to tell them what to do. I believe such people exist. There's plenty of \\nempirical evidence: armies, religious cults, and so on. They may even be the majority.\\nIf you're\", \"y of \\nsaying they need someone to tell them what to do.

In a good startup, you don't get told what to do very much. \\nThere may be one person whose job title is CEO, but till the company has about twelve people \\nno one should be telling anyone what to do. That's too inefficient. Each person should just do \\nwhat they need to without anyone telling them.\\nIf that sounds like a recipe for chaos, think about a soccer team. Eleven people manage to work \\ntogether in quite complicated ways, and yet only in occasional emergencies does anyone tell \\nanyone else what to do.

If you'd bristle at the \\nsuggestion that you aren't, then you probably are.\\n13. Fear of uncertainty\\nPerhaps some people are deterred from starting startups because they don't like the \\nuncertainty. If you go to work for Microsoft, you can predict fairly accurately what the next few \\nyears will be like—all too accurately, in fact. If you start a startup, anything might happen.\\nWell, if you're troubled by uncertainty, I can solve that problem for you: if you start a startup, it \\nwill probably fail.

Families are entitled to their own \\ntraditions, and who am I to argue with them? But I will give you a couple reasons why a safe \\ncareer might not be what your parents really want for you.\\nOne is that parents tend to be more conservative for their kids than they would be for \\nthemselves.

Anyone can see they're not the same by the number of \\npeople who are smart, but not very wise. And yet intelligence and wisdom do seem related. \\nHow?\\nWhat is wisdom? I'd say it's knowing what to do in a lot of situations. I'm not trying to make a \\ndeep point here about the true nature of wisdom, just to figure out how we use the word. A wise \\nperson is someone who usually knows the right thing to do.\\nAnd yet isn't being smart also knowing what to do in certain situations? For example, knowing \\nwhat to do when the teacher tells your elementary school class to add \", \"ually knows the right thing to do.\\nAnd yet isn't being smart also knowing what to do in certain situations? For example, knowing \\nwhat to do when the teacher tells your elementary school class to add all the numbers from 1 to \\n100? [1]\\nSome say wisdom and intelligence apply to different types of problems—wisdom to human \\nproblems and intelligence to abstract ones. But that isn't true. Some wisdom has nothing to do \\nwith people: for example, the wisdom of the engineer who knows certain structures are less \\nprone to failure than others. And certainly smart people can find clever solutions to human \\nproblems as well as abstract ones. [2]\\nAnother popular explanation is that wisdom comes from experience while intelligence is innate. \\nBut people are not simply wise in proportion to how much experience they have. Other things \\nmust contribute to wisdom besides experience, and some may be innate: a reflective \\ndisposition, for example.\\nNeither of the conventional explanations of the difference\", 'rience they have. Other things \\nmust contribute to wisdom besides experience, and some may be innate: a reflective \\ndisposition, for example.\\nNeither of the conventional explanations of the difference between wisdom and intelligence \\nstands up to scrutiny. So what is the difference? If we look at how people use the words \"wise\" \\nand \"smart,\" what they seem to mean is different shapes of performance.\\nCurve\\n\"Wise\" and \"smart\" are both ways of saying someone knows what to do. The difference is that \\n\"wise\" means one has a high average outcome across all situations, and \"smart\" means one \\ndoes spectacularly well in a few. That is, if you had a graph in which the x axis represented \\nsituations and the y axis the outcome, the graph of the wise person would be high overall, and \\nthe graph of the smart person would have high peaks.\\nThe distinction is similar to the rule that one should judge talent at its best and character at its \\nworst. Except you judge intelligence at its best, and wisdom b', \"smart person would have high peaks.\\nThe distinction is similar to the rule that one should judge talent at its best and character at its \\nworst. Except you judge intelligence at its best, and wisdom by its average. That's how the two \\nare related: they're the two different senses in which the same curve can be high.\\nSo a wise person knows what to do in most situations, while a smart person knows what to do \\nin situations where few others could. We need to add one more qualification: we should ignore \\ncases where someone knows what to do because they have inside information. [3] But aside \\nfrom that, I don't think we can get much more specific without starting to be mistaken.\\nNor do we need to. Simple as it is, this explanation predicts, or at least accords with, both of the \\nconventional stories about the distinction between wisdom and intelligence. Human problems \\nare the most common type, so being good at solving those is key in achieving a high average \\noutcome. And it seems natural\", 'tories about the distinction between wisdom and intelligence. Human problems \\nare the most common type, so being good at solving those is key in achieving a high average \\noutcome. And it seems natural that a high average outcome depends mostly on experience, but \\nthat dramatic peaks can only be achieved by people with certain rare, innate qualities; nearly \\nanyone can learn to be a good swimmer, but to be an Olympic swimmer you need a certain \\nbody type.\\nThis explanation also suggests why wisdom is such an elusive concept: there\\'s no such thing. \\n\"Wise\" means something—that one is on average good at making the right choice. But giving \\nthe name \"wisdom\" to the supposed quality that enables one to do that doesn\\'t mean such a \\nthing exists. To the extent \"wisdom\" means anything, it refers to a grab-bag of qualities as \\nvarious as self-discipline, experience, and empathy. [4]\\nLikewise, though \"intelligent\" means something, we\\'re asking for trouble if we insist on looking \\nfor a single thi', ' a grab-bag of qualities as \\nvarious as self-discipline, experience, and empathy. [4]\\nLikewise, though \"intelligent\" means something, we\\'re asking for trouble if we insist on looking \\nfor a single thing called \"intelligence.\" And whatever its components, they\\'re not all innate. We \\nuse the word \"intelligent\" as an indication of ability: a smart person can grasp things few others \\ncould. It does seem likely there\\'s some inborn predisposition to intelligence (and wisdom too), \\nbut this predisposition is not itself intelligence.\\nOne reason we tend to think of intelligence as inborn is that people trying to measure it have \\nconcentrated on the aspects of it that are most measurable. A quality that\\'s inborn will obviously \\nbe more convenient to work with than one that\\'s influenced by experience, and thus might vary \\nin the course of a study. The problem comes when we drag the word \"intelligence\" over onto \\nwhat they\\'re measuring. If they\\'re measuring something inborn, they can\\'t be measurin', ', and thus might vary \\nin the course of a study. The problem comes when we drag the word \"intelligence\" over onto \\nwhat they\\'re measuring. If they\\'re measuring something inborn, they can\\'t be measuring \\nintelligence. Three year olds aren\\'t smart. When we describe one as smart, it\\'s shorthand for \\n\"smarter than other three year olds.\"\\nSplit\\nPerhaps it\\'s a technicality to point out that a predisposition to intelligence is not the same as \\nintelligence. But it\\'s an important technicality, because it reminds us that we can become \\nsmarter, just as we can become wiser.\\nThe alarming thing is that we may have to choose between the two.\\nIf wisdom and intelligence are the average and peaks of the same curve, then they converge as \\nthe number of points on the curve decreases. If there\\'s just one point, they\\'re identical: the \\naverage and maximum are the same. But as the number of points increases, wisdom and \\nintelligence diverge. And historically the number of points on the curve seems to have ', 'nt, they\\'re identical: the \\naverage and maximum are the same. But as the number of points increases, wisdom and \\nintelligence diverge. And historically the number of points on the curve seems to have been \\nincreasing: our ability is tested in an ever wider range of situations.\\nIn the time of Confucius and Socrates, people seem to have regarded wisdom, learning, and \\nintelligence as more closely related than we do. Distinguishing between \"wise\" and \"smart\" is a \\nmodern habit. [5] And the reason we do is that they\\'ve been diverging. As knowledge gets more \\nspecialized, there are more points on the curve, and the distinction between the spikes and the \\naverage becomes sharper, like a digital image rendered with more pixels.\\nOne consequence is that some old recipes may have become obsolete. At the very least we \\nhave to go back and figure out if they were really recipes for wisdom or intelligence. But the \\nreally striking change, as intelligence and wisdom drift apart, is that we may have ', \" the very least we \\nhave to go back and figure out if they were really recipes for wisdom or intelligence. But the \\nreally striking change, as intelligence and wisdom drift apart, is that we may have to decide \\nwhich we prefer. We may not be able to optimize for both simultaneously.\\nSociety seems to have voted for intelligence. We no longer admire the sage—not the way \\npeople did two thousand years ago. Now we admire the genius. Because in fact the distinction \\nwe began with has a rather brutal converse: just as you can be smart without being very wise, \\nyou can be wise without being very smart. That doesn't sound especially admirable. That gets \\nyou James Bond, who knows what to do in a lot of situations, but has to rely on Q for the ones \\ninvolving math.\\nIntelligence and wisdom are obviously not mutually exclusive. In fact, a high average may help \\nsupport high peaks. But there are reasons to believe that at some point you have to choose \\nbetween them. One is the example of very smar\", 'usly not mutually exclusive. In fact, a high average may help \\nsupport high peaks. But there are reasons to believe that at some point you have to choose \\nbetween them. One is the example of very smart people, who are so often unwise that in \\npopular culture this now seems to be regarded as the rule rather than the exception. Perhaps \\nthe absent-minded professor is wise in his way, or wiser than he seems, but he\\'s not wise in the \\nway Confucius or Socrates wanted people to be. [6]\\nNew\\nFor both Confucius and Socrates, wisdom, virtue, and happiness were necessarily related. The \\nwise man was someone who knew what the right choice was and always made it; to be the \\nright choice, it had to be morally right; he was therefore always happy, knowing he\\'d done the \\nbest he could. I can\\'t think of many ancient philosophers who would have disagreed with that, \\nso far as it goes.\\n\"The superior man is always happy; the small man sad,\" said Confucius. [7]\\nWhereas a few years ago I read an interview ', 'any ancient philosophers who would have disagreed with that, \\nso far as it goes.\\n\"The superior man is always happy; the small man sad,\" said Confucius. [7]\\nWhereas a few years ago I read an interview with a mathematician who said that most nights \\nhe went to bed discontented, feeling he hadn\\'t made enough progress. [8] The Chinese and \\nGreek words we translate as \"happy\" didn\\'t mean exactly what we do by it, but there\\'s enough \\noverlap that this remark contradicts them.\\nIs the mathematician a small man because he\\'s discontented? No; he\\'s just doing a kind of \\nwork that wasn\\'t very common in Confucius\\'s day.\\nHuman knowledge seems to grow fractally. Time after time, something that seemed a small and \\nuninteresting area—experimental error, even—turns out, when examined up close, to have as \\nmuch in it as all knowledge up to that point.

Now it's the career of thousands. And in work that \\ninvolves making new things, some old rules don't apply.\\nRecently I've spent some time advising people, and there I find the ancient rule still works: try to \\nunderstand the situation as well as you can, give the best advice you can based on your \\nexperience, and then don't worry about it, knowing you did all you could. But I don't have \\nanything like this serenity when I'm writing an essay. Then I'm worried. What if I run out of \\nideas? And when I'm writing, four nights out of five I go to bed discontented, feeling I didn't get \\nenough done.\\nAdvising people and writing are fundamentally different types of work. When people come to \\nyou with a problem and you have to figure out the right thing to do, you \", \"feeling I didn't get \\nenough done.\\nAdvising people and writing are fundamentally different types of work.

The search space is too big.\\nSomeone like a judge or a military officer can in much of his work be guided by duty, but duty is \\nno guide in making things. Makers depend on something more precarious: inspiration. And like \\nmost people who lead a precarious existence, they tend to be worried, not contented. In that \\nrespect they're more like the small man of Confucius's day, always one bad harvest (or ruler) \\naway from starvation.

The idea that a successful \\nperson should be happy has thousands of years of momentum behind it. If I was any good, why \\ndidn\\'t I have the easy confidence winners are supposed to have? But that, I now believe, is like \\na runner asking \"If I\\'m such a good athlete, why do I feel so tired?\" Good runners still get tired; \\nthey just get tired at higher speeds.\\nPeople whose work is to invent or discover things are in the same position as the runner. \\nThere\\'s no way for them to do the best they can, because there\\'s no limit to what they could do. \\nThe closest you can come is to compare yourself to other people.

Runners can at least compare themselves \\nto others doing exactly the same thing; if you win an Olympic gold medal, you can be fairly \\ncontent, even if you think you could have run a bit faster. But what is a novelist to do?\\nWhereas if you're doing the kind of work in which problems are presented to you and you have \\nto choose between several alternatives, there's an upper bound on your performance: choosing \\nthe best every time. In ancient societies, nearly all work seems to have been of this type. The \\npeasant had to decide whether a garment was worth mending, and the king whether or not to \\ninvade his neighbor, but neither was expected to invent anything. In principle they could have; \\nthe king could have invented firearms, then invaded his neighbor. But in practice innovations \\nwere so rare t\", \" his neighbor, but neither was expected to invent anything. In principle they could have; \\nthe king could have invented firearms, then invaded his neighbor. But in practice innovations \\nwere so rare that they weren't expected of you, any more than goalkeepers are expected to \\nscore goals. [9] In practice, it seemed as if there was a correct decision in every situation, and if \\nyou made it you'd done your job perfectly, just as a goalkeeper who prevents the other team \\nfrom scoring is considered to have played a perfect game.\\nIn this world, wisdom seemed paramount. [10] Even now, most people do work in which \\nproblems are put before them and they have to choose the best alternative. But as knowledge \\nhas grown more specialized, there are more and more types of work in which people have to \\nmake up new things, and in which performance is therefore unbounded. Intelligence has \\nbecome increasingly important relative to wisdom because there is more room for spikes.\\nRecipes\\nAnother sign we m\", \"make up new things, and in which performance is therefore unbounded. Intelligence has \\nbecome increasingly important relative to wisdom because there is more room for spikes.\\nRecipes\\nAnother sign we may have to choose between intelligence and wisdom is how different their \\nrecipes are. Wisdom seems to come largely from curing childish qualities, and intelligence \\nlargely from cultivating them.\\nRecipes for wisdom, particularly ancient ones, tend to have a remedial character. To achieve \\nwisdom one must cut away all the debris that fills one's head on emergence from childhood, \\nleaving only the important stuff. Both self-control and experience have this effect: to eliminate \\nthe random biases that come from your own nature and from the circumstances of your \\nupbringing respectively. That's not all wisdom is, but it's a large part of it. Much of what's in the \\nsage's head is also in the head of every twelve year old.

The difference is that in the head of the \\ntwelve year old it's mixed together with a lot of random junk.\\nThe path to intelligence seems to be through working on hard problems. You develop \\nintelligence as you might develop muscles, through exercise. But there can't be too much \\ncompulsion here. No amount of discipline can replace genuine curiosity. So cultivating \\nintelligence seems to be a matter of identifying some bias in one's character—some tendency \\nto be interested in certain types of things—and nurturing it. Instead of obliterating your \\nidiosyncrasies in an effort to make yourself a neutral vessel for the truth, you select one and try \\nto grow it from a seedling into a tree.\\nThe wise are all much alike in their wisdom, but very smart people tend to be smart in \\ndistinctive ways.\\nMost of our educational traditions aim at wisdom.

But \\nthat's not the route to intelligence. Whereas wisdom comes through humility, it may actually \\nhelp, in cultivating intelligence, to have a mistakenly high opinion of your abilities, because that \\nencourages you to keep working.

But I think it\\'s \\nimportant to understand the relationship between intelligence and wisdom, and particularly \\nwhat seems to be the growing gap between them. That way we can avoid applying rules and \\nstandards to intelligence that are really meant for wisdom. These two senses of \"knowing what \\nto do\" are more different than most people realize. The path to wisdom is through discipline, \\nand the path to intelligence through carefully selected self-indulgence. Wisdom is universa', 'knowing what \\nto do\" are more different than most people realize. The path to wisdom is through discipline, \\nand the path to intelligence through carefully selected self-indulgence. Wisdom is universal, and \\nintelligence idiosyncratic. And while wisdom yields calmness, intelligence much of the time \\nleads to discontentment.\\nThat\\'s particularly worth remembering. A physicist friend recently told me half his department \\nwas on Prozac. Perhaps if we acknowledge that some amount of frustration is inevitable in \\ncertain kinds of work, we can mitigate its effects. Perhaps we can box it up and put it away \\nsome of the time, instead of letting it flow together with everyday sadness to produce what \\nseems an alarmingly large pool. At the very least, we can avoid being discontented about being \\ndiscontented.\\nIf you feel exhausted, it\\'s not necessarily because there\\'s something wrong with you.

But while this is certainly an important relationship between wisdom and intelligence, it's not the distinction \\nbetween them. Wisdom is useful in solving problems too, and intelligence can help in deciding what to do with the \\nsolutions.\\n[3] In judging both intelligence and wisdom we have to factor out some knowledge.

Whereas the value of understanding vanity would decline more gradually.\\nThe knowledge whose utility drops sharply is the kind that has little relation to other knowledge.

Wisdom is just knowing the right \\nthing to do, and there are a hundred and one different qualities that help in that.

Each person has things \\nthey like, but no one's preferences are any better than anyone else's. There is no such thing as \\ngood taste.\\nLike a lot of things I grew up believing, this turns out to be false, and I'm going to try to explain \\nwhy.\\nOne problem with saying there's no such thing as good taste is that it also means there's no \\nsuch thing as good art. If there were good art, then people who liked it would have better taste \\nthan people who didn't. So if you discard\", \"o such thing as good taste is that it also means there's no \\nsuch thing as good art. If there were good art, then people who liked it would have better taste \\nthan people who didn't. So if you discard taste, you also have to discard the idea of art being \\ngood, and artists being good at making it.\\nIt was pulling on that thread that unravelled my childhood faith in relativism. When you're trying \\nto make things, taste becomes a practical matter. You have to decide what to do next. Would it \\nmake the painting better if I changed that part? If there's no such thing as better, it doesn't \\nmatter what you do. In fact, it doesn't matter if you paint at all. You could just go out and buy a \\nready-made blank canvas. If there's no such thing as good, that would be just as great an \\nachievement as the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. Less laborious, certainly, but if you can \\nachieve the same level of performance with less effort, surely that's more impressive, not less.\\nYet that doesn't seem quit\", 'he ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. Less laborious, certainly, but if you can \\nachieve the same level of performance with less effort, surely that\\'s more impressive, not less.\\nYet that doesn\\'t seem quite right, does it?\\nAudience\\nI think the key to this puzzle is to remember that art has an audience. Art has a purpose, which \\nis to interest its audience. Good art (like good anything) is art that achieves its purpose \\nparticularly well. The meaning of \"interest\" can vary. Some works of art are meant to shock, and \\nothers to please; some are meant to jump out at you, and others to sit quietly in the \\nbackground. But all art has to work on an audience, and—here\\'s the critical point—members of \\nthe audience share things in common.\\nFor example, nearly all humans find human faces engaging. It seems to be wired into us. \\nBabies can recognize faces practically from birth. In fact, faces seem to have co-evolved with \\nour interest in them; the face is the body\\'s billboard. So all other things being', \" to be wired into us. \\nBabies can recognize faces practically from birth. In fact, faces seem to have co-evolved with \\nour interest in them; the face is the body's billboard. So all other things being equal, a painting \\nwith faces in it will interest people more than one without. [1]\\nOne reason it's easy to believe that taste is merely personal preference is that, if it isn't, how do \\nyou pick out the people with better taste? There are billions of people, each with their own \\nopinion; on what grounds can you prefer one to another? [2]\\nBut if audiences have a lot in common, you're not in a position of having to choose one out of a \\nrandom set of individual biases, because the set isn't random. All humans find faces engaging—\\npractically by definition: face recognition is in our DNA. And so having a notion of good art, in \\nthe sense of art that does its job well, doesn't require you to pick out a few individuals and label \\ntheir opinions as correct. No matter who you pick, they'll find \", \" having a notion of good art, in \\nthe sense of art that does its job well, doesn't require you to pick out a few individuals and label \\ntheir opinions as correct. No matter who you pick, they'll find faces engaging.\\nOf course, space aliens probably wouldn't find human faces engaging. But there might be other \\nthings they shared in common with us. The most likely source of examples is math. I expect \\nspace aliens would agree with us most of the time about which of two proofs was better. Erdos \\nthought so. He called a maximally elegant proof one out of God's book, and presumably God's \\nbook is universal. [3]\\nOnce you start talking about audiences, you don't have to argue simply that there are or aren't \\nstandards of taste. Instead tastes are a series of concentric rings, like ripples in a pond. There \\nare some things that will appeal to you and your friends, others that will appeal to most people \\nyour age, others that will appeal to most humans, and perhaps others that would appeal to \\n\", 'nd. There \\nare some things that will appeal to you and your friends, others that will appeal to most people \\nyour age, others that will appeal to most humans, and perhaps others that would appeal to \\nmost sentient beings (whatever that means).\\nThe picture is slightly more complicated than that, because in the middle of the pond there are \\noverlapping sets of ripples. For example, there might be things that appealed particularly to \\nmen, or to people from a certain culture.\\nIf good art is art that interests its audience, then when you talk about art being good, you also \\nhave to say for what audience. So is it meaningless to talk about art simply being good or bad? \\nNo, because one audience is the set of all possible humans. I think that\\'s the audience people \\nare implicitly talking about when they say a work of art is good: they mean it would engage any \\nhuman. [4]\\nAnd that is a meaningful test, because although, like any everyday concept, \"human\" is fuzzy \\naround the edges, there are ', 'hen they say a work of art is good: they mean it would engage any \\nhuman. [4]\\nAnd that is a meaningful test, because although, like any everyday concept, \"human\" is fuzzy \\naround the edges, there are a lot of things practically all humans have in common. In addition to \\nour interest in faces, there\\'s something special about primary colors for nearly all of us, \\nbecause it\\'s an artifact of the way our eyes work. Most humans will also find images of 3D \\nobjects engaging, because that also seems to be built into our visual perception. [5] And \\nbeneath that there\\'s edge-finding, which makes images with definite shapes more engaging \\nthan mere blur.\\nHumans have a lot more in common than this, of course. My goal is not to compile a complete \\nlist, just to show that there\\'s some solid ground here. People\\'s preferences aren\\'t random. So an \\nartist working on a painting and trying to decide whether to change some part of it doesn\\'t have \\nto think \"Why bother? I might as well flip a coin.\" Inste', '. People\\'s preferences aren\\'t random. So an \\nartist working on a painting and trying to decide whether to change some part of it doesn\\'t have \\nto think \"Why bother? I might as well flip a coin.\" Instead he can ask \"What would make the \\npainting more interesting to people?\" And the reason you can\\'t equal Michelangelo by going out \\nand buying a blank canvas is that the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel is more interesting to people.\\nA lot of philosophers have had a hard time believing it was possible for there to be objective \\nstandards for art. It seemed obvious that beauty, for example, was something that happened in \\nthe head of the observer, not something that was a property of objects. It was thus \"subjective\" \\nrather than \"objective.\" But in fact if you narrow the definition of beauty to something that works \\na certain way on humans, and you observe how much humans have in common, it turns out to \\nbe a property of objects after all. You don\\'t have to choose between something being a pr', \"omething that works \\na certain way on humans, and you observe how much humans have in common, it turns out to \\nbe a property of objects after all. You don't have to choose between something being a property \\nof the subject or the object if subjects all react similarly. Being good art is thus a property of \\nobjects as much as, say, being toxic to humans is: it's good art if it consistently affects humans \\nin a certain way.\\nError\\nSo could we figure out what the best art is by taking a vote? After all, if appealing to humans is \\nthe test, we should be able to just ask them, right?\\nWell, not quite. For products of nature that might work. I'd be willing to eat the apple the world's \\npopulation had voted most delicious, and I'd probably be willing to visit the beach they voted \\nmost beautiful, but having to look at the painting they voted the best would be a crapshoot.\\nMan-made stuff is different.

Some tricks ar\", \"ut having to look at the painting they voted the best would be a crapshoot.\\nMan-made stuff is different. For one thing, artists, unlike apple trees, often deliberately try to \\ntrick us. Some tricks are quite subtle. For example, any work of art sets expectations by its level \\nof finish. You don't expect photographic accuracy in something that looks like a quick sketch. So \\none widely used trick, especially among illustrators, is to intentionally make a painting or \\ndrawing look like it was done faster than it was. The average person looks at it and thinks: how \\namazingly skillful. It's like saying something clever in a conversation as if you'd thought of it on \\nthe spur of the moment, when in fact you'd worked it out the day before.\\nAnother much less subtle influence is brand. If you go to see the Mona Lisa, you'll probably be \\ndisappointed, because it's hidden behind a thick glass wall and surrounded by a frenzied crowd \\ntaking pictures of themselves in front of it. At best you can se\", \" see the Mona Lisa, you'll probably be \\ndisappointed, because it's hidden behind a thick glass wall and surrounded by a frenzied crowd \\ntaking pictures of themselves in front of it. At best you can see it the way you see a friend \\nacross the room at a crowded party. The Louvre might as well replace it with copy; no one \\nwould be able to tell. And yet the Mona Lisa is a small, dark painting. If you found people who'd \\nnever seen an image of it and sent them to a museum in which it was hanging among other \\npaintings with a tag labelling it as a portrait by an unknown fifteenth century artist, most would \\nwalk by without giving it a second look.\\nFor the average person, brand dominates all other factors in the judgement of art. Seeing a \\npainting they recognize from reproductions is so overwhelming that their response to it as a \\npainting is drowned out.\\nAnd then of course there are the tricks people play on themselves. Most adults looking at art \\nworry that if they don't like what they're\", \"lming that their response to it as a \\npainting is drowned out.\\nAnd then of course there are the tricks people play on themselves. Most adults looking at art \\nworry that if they don't like what they're supposed to, they'll be thought uncultured. This doesn't \\njust affect what they claim to like; they actually make themselves like things they're supposed to.\\nThat's why you can't just take a vote. Though appeal to people is a meaningful test, in practice \\nyou can't measure it, just as you can't find north using a compass with a magnet sitting next to \\nit. There are sources of error so powerful that if you take a vote, all you're measuring is the error.\\nWe can, however, approach our goal from another direction, by using ourselves as guinea pigs. \\nYou're human. If you want to know what the basic human reaction to a piece of art would be, \\nyou can at least approach that by getting rid of the sources of error in your own judgements.\\nFor example, while anyone's reaction to a famous painting wi\", \"c human reaction to a piece of art would be, \\nyou can at least approach that by getting rid of the sources of error in your own judgements.\\nFor example, while anyone's reaction to a famous painting will be warped at first by its fame, \\nthere are ways to decrease its effects. One is to come back to the painting over and over. After \\na few days the fame wears off, and you can start to see it as a painting. Another is to stand \\nclose. A painting familiar from reproductions looks more familiar from ten feet away; close in you \\nsee details that get lost in reproductions, and which you're therefore seeing for the first time.\\nThere are two main kinds of error that get in the way of seeing a work of art: biases you bring \\nfrom your own circumstances, and tricks played by the artist. Tricks are straightforward to \\ncorrect for. Merely being aware of them usually prevents them from working. For example, when \\nI was ten I used to be very impressed by airbrushed lettering that looked like shiny met\", \"aightforward to \\ncorrect for. Merely being aware of them usually prevents them from working. For example, when \\nI was ten I used to be very impressed by airbrushed lettering that looked like shiny metal. But \\nonce you study how it's done, you see that it's a pretty cheesy trick—one of the sort that relies \\non pushing a few visual buttons really hard to temporarily overwhelm the viewer. It's like trying \\nto convince someone by shouting at them.\\nThe way not to be vulnerable to tricks is to explicitly seek out and catalog them. When you \\nnotice a whiff of dishonesty coming from some kind of art, stop and figure out what's going on. \\nWhen someone is obviously pandering to an audience that's easily fooled, whether it's \\nsomeone making shiny stuff to impress ten year olds, or someone making conspicuously avant-\\ngarde stuff to impress would-be intellectuals, learn how they do it.

Once you\\'ve seen enough \\nexamples of specific types of tricks, you start to become a connoisseur of trickery in general, \\njust as professional magicians are.\\nWhat counts as a trick? Roughly, it\\'s something done with contempt for the audience. For \\nexample, the guys designing Ferraris in the 1950s were probably designing cars that they \\nthemselves admired. Whereas I suspect over at General Motors the marketing people are \\ntelling the designers, \"Most people who buy SUVs do it to seem manly, not to drive off-road. So \\ndon\\'t worry about the suspension; just make that sucker as big and tough-looking as you \\ncan.\" [6]\\nI think with some effort you can make yourself nearly immune to tricks. It\\'s harder to escape the \\ninfluence of your own circumstances, but you can at least move in that direction. The way to do \\nit is to travel widely, in both time and space.

The way to do \\nit is to travel widely, in both time and space. If you go and see all the different kinds of things \\npeople like in other cultures, and learn about all the different things people have liked in the \\npast, you'll probably find it changes what you like. I doubt you could ever make yourself into a \\ncompletely universal person, if only because you can only travel in one direction in time. But if \\nyou find a work of art that would appeal equally to your friends, to people in Nepal, and to the \\nancient Greeks, you're probably onto something.\\nMy main point here is not how to have good taste, but that there can even be such a thing. And \\nI think I've shown that. There is such a thing as good art. It's art that interests its human \\naudience, and since humans have a lot in common, what interests them is not random. Since \\nthere's such a thing as good art, there's also such a thing as good taste\", \" It's art that interests its human \\naudience, and since humans have a lot in common, what interests them is not random. Since \\nthere's such a thing as good art, there's also such a thing as good taste, which is the ability to \\nrecognize it.\\nIf we were talking about the taste of apples, I'd agree that taste is just personal preference. \\nSome people like certain kinds of apples and others like other kinds, but how can you say that \\none is right and the other wrong? [7]\\nThe thing is, art isn't apples. Art is man-made. It comes with a lot of cultural baggage, and in \\naddition the people who make it often try to trick us. Most people's judgement of art is \\ndominated by these extraneous factors; they're like someone trying to judge the taste of apples \\nin a dish made of equal parts apples and jalapeno peppers. All they're tasting is the peppers. \\nSo it turns out you can pick out some people and say that they have better taste than others: \\nthey're the ones who actually taste art like apples.\", 'lapeno peppers. All they\\'re tasting is the peppers. \\nSo it turns out you can pick out some people and say that they have better taste than others: \\nthey\\'re the ones who actually taste art like apples.\\nOr to put it more prosaically, they\\'re the people who (a) are hard to trick, and (b) don\\'t just like \\nwhatever they grew up with. If you could find people who\\'d eliminated all such influences on \\ntheir judgement, you\\'d probably still see variation in what they liked. But because humans have \\nso much in common, you\\'d also find they agreed on a lot. They\\'d nearly all prefer the ceiling of \\nthe Sistine Chapel to a blank canvas.\\nMaking It\\nI wrote this essay because I was tired of hearing \"taste is subjective\" and wanted to kill it once \\nand for all. Anyone who makes things knows intuitively that\\'s not true. When you\\'re trying to \\nmake art, the temptation to be lazy is as great as in any other kind of work. Of course it matters \\nto do a good job. And yet you can see how great a hold \"taste is ', 's not true. When you\\'re trying to \\nmake art, the temptation to be lazy is as great as in any other kind of work. Of course it matters \\nto do a good job. And yet you can see how great a hold \"taste is subjective\" has even in the art \\nworld by how nervous it makes people to talk about art being good or bad. Those whose jobs \\nrequire them to judge art, like curators, mostly resort to euphemisms like \"significant\" or \\n\"important\" or (getting dangerously close) \"realized.\" [8]\\nI don\\'t have any illusions that being able to talk about art being good or bad will cause the \\npeople who talk about it to have anything more useful to say. Indeed, one of the reasons \"taste \\nis subjective\" found such a receptive audience is that, historically, the things people have said \\nabout good taste have generally been such nonsense.\\nIt\\'s not for the people who talk about art that I want to free the idea of good art, but for those \\nwho make it.

Right now, ambitious kids going to art school run smack into a brick wall. They \\narrive hoping one day to be as good as the famous artists they\\'ve seen in books, and the first \\nthing they learn is that the concept of good has been retired. Instead everyone is just supposed \\nto explore their own personal vision. [9]\\nWhen I was in art school, we were looking one day at a slide of some great fifteenth century \\npainting, and one of the students asked \"Why don\\'t artists paint like that now?\" The room \\nsuddenly got quiet. Though rarely asked out loud, this question lurks uncomfortably in the back \\nof every art student\\'s mind. It was as if someone had brought up the topic of lung cancer in a \\nmeeting within Philip Morris.\\n\"Well,\" the professor replied, \"we\\'re interested in different questions now.\" He was a pretty nice \\nguy, but at the time I couldn\\'t help wishi', ' topic of lung cancer in a \\nmeeting within Philip Morris.\\n\"Well,\" the professor replied, \"we\\'re interested in different questions now.\" He was a pretty nice \\nguy, but at the time I couldn\\'t help wishing I could send him back to fifteenth century Florence to \\nexplain in person to Leonardo & Co. how we had moved beyond their early, limited concept of \\nart. Just imagine that conversation.\\nIn fact, one of the reasons artists in fifteenth century Florence made such great things was that \\nthey believed you could make great things. [10] They were intensely competitive and were \\nalways trying to outdo one another, like mathematicians or physicists today—maybe like anyone \\nwho has ever done anything really well.\\nThe idea that you could make great things was not just a useful illusion. They were actually \\nright. So the most important consequence of realizing there can be good art is that it frees \\nartists to try to make it. To the ambitious kids arriving at art school this year hoping one day to', \"ually \\nright. So the most important consequence of realizing there can be good art is that it frees \\nartists to try to make it. To the ambitious kids arriving at art school this year hoping one day to \\nmake great things, I say: don't believe it when they tell you this is a naive and outdated \\nambition. There is such a thing as good art, and if you try to make it, there are people who will \\nnotice.\\nNotes:\\n[1] This is not to say, of course, that good paintings must have faces in them, just that everyone's visual piano has \\nthat key on it. There are situations in which you want to avoid faces, precisely because they attract so much attention. \\nBut you can see how universally faces work by their prevalence in advertising.\\n[2] The other reason it's easy to believe is that it makes people feel good.

Perhaps it would be worth trying to make a formal \\nlanguage for proofs in which those considered more elegant consistently came out shorter (perhaps after being \\nmacroexpanded or compiled).\\n[4] Maybe it would be possible to make art that would appeal to space aliens, but I'm not going to get into that \\nbecause (a) it's too hard to answer, and (b) I'm satisfied if I can establish that good art is a meaningful idea for \\nhuman audiences.\\n[5] If early abstract paintings seem more interesting than later ones, it may be\", 's too hard to answer, and (b) I\\'m satisfied if I can establish that good art is a meaningful idea for \\nhuman audiences.\\n[5] If early abstract paintings seem more interesting than later ones, it may be because the first abstract painters \\nwere trained to paint from life, and their hands thus tended to make the kind of gestures you use in representing \\nphysical things. In effect they were saying \"scaramara\" instead of \"uebfgbsb.\"\\n[6] It\\'s a bit more complicated, because sometimes artists unconsciously use tricks by imitating art that does.\\n[7] I phrased this in terms of the taste of apples because if people can see the apples, they can be fooled. When I \\nwas a kid most apples were a variety called Red Delicious that had been bred to look appealing in stores, but which \\ndidn\\'t taste very good.\\n[8] To be fair, curators are in a difficult position.

If they\\'re dealing with recent art, they have to include things in shows \\nthat they think are bad.

So it\\'s not always intellectual \\ndishonesty that makes curators and dealers use neutral-sounding language.\\n[9] What happens in practice is that everyone gets really good at talking about art. As the art itself gets more random, \\nthe effort that would have gone into the work goes instead into the intellectual sounding theory behind it. \"My work \\nrepresents an exploration of gender and sexuality in an urban context,\" etc. Different people win at that game.\\n[10] There were several other reasons, including that Florence was then the richest and most sophisticated city in the \\nworld, and that they lived in a time before photography had (a) killed portraiture as a s', \"e were several other reasons, including that Florence was then the richest and most sophisticated city in the \\nworld, and that they lived in a time before photography had (a) killed portraiture as a source of income and (b) made \\nbrand the dominant factor in the sale of art.\\nIncidentally, I'm not saying that good art = fifteenth century European art. I'm not saying we should make what they \\nmade, but that we should work like they worked. There are fields now in which many people work with the same \\nenergy and honesty that fifteenth century artists did, but art is not one of them.\\nThanks to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this, and to Paul Watson for \\npermission to use the image at the top.\\nThe 18 Mistakes That Kill Startups - # 68\\n Want to start a startup?

Get funded by Y Combinator. \\n October 2006\\nIn the Q & A period after a recent talk, someone asked what made startups fail. After standing \\nthere gaping for a few seconds I realized this was kind of a trick question. It's equivalent to \\nasking how to make a startup succeed — if you avoid every cause of failure, you succeed — \\nand that's too big a question to answer on the fly.\\nAfterwards I realized it could be helpful to look at the problem from this direction. If you have a \\nlist of all the things you shouldn't do, you can turn that into a recipe for succeeding just by \\nnegating. And this form of list may be more useful in practice. It's easier to catch yourself doing \\nsomething you shouldn't than always to remember to do something you should. [1]\\nIn a sense there's just one mistake that kills startups: not making something users want. If you \\nmake something users want, you'll probably be fine, whatever else you do or don't do. And if \\nyou don't make something users want, \", \"istake that kills startups: not making something users want. If you \\nmake something users want, you'll probably be fine, whatever else you do or don't do. And if \\nyou don't make something users want, then you're dead, whatever else you do or don't do. So \\nreally this is a list of 18 things that cause startups not to make something users want. Nearly all \\nfailure funnels through that.\\n1. Single Founder\\nHave you ever noticed how few successful startups were founded by just one person? Even \\ncompanies you think of as having one founder, like Oracle, usually turn out to have more. It \\nseems unlikely this is a coincidence.\\nWhat's wrong with having one founder? To start with, it's a vote of no confidence. It probably \\nmeans the founder couldn't talk any of his friends into starting the company with him. That's \\npretty alarming, because his friends are the ones who know him best.\\nBut even if the founder's friends were all wrong and the company is a good bet, he's still at a \\ndisadvantage. Sta\", 'ith him. That\\'s \\npretty alarming, because his friends are the ones who know him best.\\nBut even if the founder\\'s friends were all wrong and the company is a good bet, he\\'s still at a \\ndisadvantage. Starting a startup is too hard for one person. Even if you could do all the work \\nyourself, you need colleagues to brainstorm with, to talk you out of stupid decisions, and to \\ncheer you up when things go wrong.\\nThe last one might be the most important. The low points in a startup are so low that few could \\nbear them alone. When you have multiple founders, esprit de corps binds them together in a \\nway that seems to violate conservation laws. Each thinks \"I can\\'t let my friends down.\" This is \\none of the most powerful forces in human nature, and it\\'s missing when there\\'s just one founder.\\n2. Bad Location\\nStartups prosper in some places and not others. Silicon Valley dominates, then Boston, then \\nSeattle, Austin, Denver, and New York. After that there\\'s not much. Even in New York the \\nnumber of', \"ocation\\nStartups prosper in some places and not others. Silicon Valley dominates, then Boston, then \\nSeattle, Austin, Denver, and New York. After that there's not much. Even in New York the \\nnumber of startups per capita is probably a 20th of what it is in Silicon Valley. In towns like \\nHouston and Chicago and Detroit it's too small to measure.\\nWhy is the falloff so sharp? Probably for the same reason it is in other industries. What's the \\nsixth largest fashion center in the US? The sixth largest center for oil, or finance, or publishing? \\nWhatever they are they're probably so far from the top that it would be misleading even to call \\nthem centers.\\nIt's an interesting question why cities become startup hubs, but the reason startups prosper in \\nthem is probably the same as it is for any industry: that's where the experts are. Standards are \\nhigher; people are more sympathetic to what you're doing; the kind of people you want to hire \\nwant to live there; supporting industries are there; \", \"ustry: that's where the experts are. Standards are \\nhigher; people are more sympathetic to what you're doing; the kind of people you want to hire \\nwant to live there; supporting industries are there; the people you run into in chance meetings \\nare in the same business. Who knows exactly how these factors combine to boost startups in \\nSilicon Valley and squish them in Detroit, but it's clear they do from the number of startups per \\ncapita in each.\\n3. Marginal Niche\\nMost of the groups that apply to Y Combinator suffer from a common problem: choosing a \\nsmall, obscure niche in the hope of avoiding competition.\\nIf you watch little kids playing sports, you notice that below a certain age they're afraid of the \\nball. When the ball comes near them their instinct is to avoid it. I didn't make a lot of catches as \\nan eight year old outfielder, because whenever a fly ball came my way, I used to close my eyes \\nand hold my glove up more for protection than in the hope of catching it.\\nChoosing a ma\", \"t of catches as \\nan eight year old outfielder, because whenever a fly ball came my way, I used to close my eyes \\nand hold my glove up more for protection than in the hope of catching it.\\nChoosing a marginal project is the startup equivalent of my eight year old strategy for dealing \\nwith fly balls. If you make anything good, you're going to have competitors, so you may as well \\nface that. You can only avoid competition by avoiding good ideas.\\nI think this shrinking from big problems is mostly unconscious. It's not that people think of grand \\nideas but decide to pursue smaller ones because they seem safer. Your unconscious won't \\neven let you think of grand ideas. So the solution may be to think about ideas without involving \\nyourself. What would be a great idea for someone else to do as a startup?\\n4. Derivative Idea\\nMany of the applications we get are imitations of some existing company. That's one source of \\nideas, but not the best. If you look at the origins of successful startups, f\", \"startup?\\n4. Derivative Idea\\nMany of the applications we get are imitations of some existing company. That's one source of \\nideas, but not the best. If you look at the origins of successful startups, few were started in \\nimitation of some other startup. Where did they get their ideas? Usually from some specific, \\nunsolved problem the founders identified.\\nOur startup made software for making online stores. When we started it, there wasn't any; the \\nfew sites you could order from were hand-made at great expense by web consultants. We knew \\nthat if online shopping ever took off, these sites would have to be generated by software, so we \\nwrote some. Pretty straightforward.\\nIt seems like the best problems to solve are ones that affect you personally. Apple happened \\nbecause Steve Wozniak wanted a computer, Google because Larry and Sergey couldn't find \\nstuff online, Hotmail because Sabeer Bhatia and Jack Smith couldn't exchange email at work.\\nSo instead of copying the Facebook, with some var\", \"a computer, Google because Larry and Sergey couldn't find \\nstuff online, Hotmail because Sabeer Bhatia and Jack Smith couldn't exchange email at work.\\nSo instead of copying the Facebook, with some variation that the Facebook rightly ignored, look \\nfor ideas from the other direction. Instead of starting from companies and working back to the \\nproblems they solved, look for problems and imagine the company that might solve them. [2] \\nWhat do people complain about? What do you wish there was?\\n5. Obstinacy\\nIn some fields the way to succeed is to have a vision of what you want to achieve, and to hold \\ntrue to it no matter what setbacks you encounter. Starting startups is not one of them. The stick-\\nto-your-vision approach works for something like winning an Olympic gold medal, where the \\nproblem is well-defined. Startups are more like science, where you need to follow the trail \\nwherever it leads.\\nSo don't get too attached to your original plan, because it's probably wrong. Most successful \", \"m is well-defined. Startups are more like science, where you need to follow the trail \\nwherever it leads.\\nSo don't get too attached to your original plan, because it's probably wrong. Most successful \\nstartups end up doing something different than they originally intended — often so different that \\nit doesn't even seem like the same company. You have to be prepared to see the better idea \\nwhen it arrives. And the hardest part of that is often discarding your old idea.\\nBut openness to new ideas has to be tuned just right. Switching to a new idea every week will \\nbe equally fatal. Is there some kind of external test you can use? One is to ask whether the \\nideas represent some kind of progression. If in each new idea you're able to re-use most of \\nwhat you built for the previous ones, then you're probably in a process that converges. Whereas \\nif you keep restarting from scratch, that's a bad sign.\\nFortunately there's someone you can ask for advice: your users. If you're thinking about tur\", \"u're probably in a process that converges. Whereas \\nif you keep restarting from scratch, that's a bad sign.\\nFortunately there's someone you can ask for advice: your users. If you're thinking about turning \\nin some new direction and your users seem excited about it, it's probably a good bet.\\n6. Hiring Bad Programmers\\nI forgot to include this in the early versions of the list, because nearly all the founders I know are \\nprogrammers. This is not a serious problem for them. They might accidentally hire someone \\nbad, but it's not going to kill the company. In a pinch they can do whatever's required \\nthemselves.\\nBut when I think about what killed most of the startups in the e-commerce business back in the \\n90s, it was bad programmers. A lot of those companies were started by business guys who \\nthought the way startups worked was that you had some clever idea and then hired \\nprogrammers to implement it. That's actually much harder than it sounds — almost impossibly \\nhard in fact — because bus\", \"hought the way startups worked was that you had some clever idea and then hired \\nprogrammers to implement it. That's actually much harder than it sounds — almost impossibly \\nhard in fact — because business guys can't tell which are the good programmers. They don't \\neven get a shot at the best ones, because no one really good wants a job implementing the \\nvision of a business guy.\\nIn practice what happens is that the business guys choose people they think are good \\nprogrammers (it says here on his resume that he's a Microsoft Certified Developer) but who \\naren't. Then they're mystified to find that their startup lumbers along like a World War II bomber \\nwhile their competitors scream past like jet fighters. This kind of startup is in the same position \\nas a big company, but without the advantages.\\nSo how do you pick good programmers if you're not a programmer? I don't think there's an \\nanswer. I was about to say you'd have to find a good programmer to help you hire people. But if \\nyou c\", \"ntages.\\nSo how do you pick good programmers if you're not a programmer? I don't think there's an \\nanswer. I was about to say you'd have to find a good programmer to help you hire people. But if \\nyou can't recognize good programmers, how would you even do that?\\n7. Choosing the Wrong Platform\\nA related problem (since it tends to be done by bad programmers) is choosing the wrong \\nplatform. For example, I think a lot of startups during the Bubble killed themselves by deciding \\nto build server-based applications on Windows. Hotmail was still running on FreeBSD for years \\nafter Microsoft bought it, presumably because Windows couldn't handle the load. If Hotmail's \\nfounders had chosen to use Windows, they would have been swamped.\\nPayPal only just dodged this bullet. After they merged with X.com, the new CEO wanted to \\nswitch to Windows — even after PayPal cofounder Max Levchin showed that their software \\nscaled only 1% as well on Windows as Unix. Fortunately for PayPal they switched CEOs \\nins\", 'the new CEO wanted to \\nswitch to Windows — even after PayPal cofounder Max Levchin showed that their software \\nscaled only 1% as well on Windows as Unix. Fortunately for PayPal they switched CEOs \\ninstead.\\nPlatform is a vague word. It could mean an operating system, or a programming language, or a \\n\"framework\" built on top of a programming language. It implies something that both supports \\nand limits, like the foundation of a house.\\nThe scary thing about platforms is that there are always some that seem to outsiders to be fine, \\nresponsible choices and yet, like Windows in the 90s, will destroy you if you choose them. Java \\napplets were probably the most spectacular example. This was supposed to be the new way of \\ndelivering applications. Presumably it killed just about 100% of the startups who believed that.\\nHow do you pick the right platforms? The usual way is to hire good programmers and let them \\nchoose. But there is a trick you could use if you\\'re not a programmer: visit a top com', \"s who believed that.\\nHow do you pick the right platforms? The usual way is to hire good programmers and let them \\nchoose. But there is a trick you could use if you're not a programmer: visit a top computer \\nscience department and see what they use in research projects.\\n8. Slowness in Launching\\nCompanies of all sizes have a hard time getting software done. It's intrinsic to the medium; \\nsoftware is always 85% done. It takes an effort of will to push through this and get something \\nreleased to users. [3]\\nStartups make all kinds of excuses for delaying their launch. Most are equivalent to the ones \\npeople use for procrastinating in everyday life. There's something that needs to happen first. \\nMaybe. But if the software were 100% finished and ready to launch at the push of a button, \\nwould they still be waiting?\\nOne reason to launch quickly is that it forces you to actually finish some quantum of work. \\nNothing is truly finished till it's released; you can see that from the rush of work th\", \"y still be waiting?\\nOne reason to launch quickly is that it forces you to actually finish some quantum of work. \\nNothing is truly finished till it's released; you can see that from the rush of work that's always \\ninvolved in releasing anything, no matter how finished you thought it was. The other reason you \\nneed to launch is that it's only by bouncing your idea off users that you fully understand it.\\nSeveral distinct problems manifest themselves as delays in launching: working too slowly; not \\ntruly understanding the problem; fear of having to deal with users; fear of being judged; working \\non too many different things; excessive perfectionism. Fortunately you can combat all of them \\nby the simple expedient of forcing yourself to launch something fairly quickly.\\n9. Launching Too Early\\nLaunching too slowly has probably killed a hundred times more startups than launching too \\nfast, but it is possible to launch too fast. The danger here is that you ruin your reputation. You \\nlaunch somet\", \"nching too slowly has probably killed a hundred times more startups than launching too \\nfast, but it is possible to launch too fast. The danger here is that you ruin your reputation. You \\nlaunch something, the early adopters try it out, and if it's no good they may never come back.\\nSo what's the minimum you need to launch? We suggest startups think about what they plan to \\ndo, identify a core that's both (a) useful on its own and (b) something that can be incrementally \\nexpanded into the whole project, and then get that done as soon as possible.\\nThis is the same approach I (and many other programmers) use for writing software. Think \\nabout the overall goal, then start by writing the smallest subset of it that does anything useful. If \\nit's a subset, you'll have to write it anyway, so in the worst case you won't be wasting your time. \\nBut more likely you'll find that implementing a working subset is both good for morale and helps \\nyou see more clearly what the rest should do.\\nThe early \", \"e worst case you won't be wasting your time. \\nBut more likely you'll find that implementing a working subset is both good for morale and helps \\nyou see more clearly what the rest should do.\\nThe early adopters you need to impress are fairly tolerant. They don't expect a newly launched \\nproduct to do everything; it just has to do something.\\n10. Having No Specific User in Mind\\nYou can't build things users like without understanding them. I mentioned earlier that the most \\nsuccessful startups seem to have begun by trying to solve a problem their founders had. \\nPerhaps there's a rule here: perhaps you create wealth in proportion to how well you \\nunderstand the problem you're solving, and the problems you understand best are your own. [4]\\nThat's just a theory. What's not a theory is the converse: if you're trying to solve problems you \\ndon't understand, you're hosed.\\nAnd yet a surprising number of founders seem willing to assume that someone, they're not sure \\nexactly who, will want what the\", ': if you\\'re trying to solve problems you \\ndon\\'t understand, you\\'re hosed.\\nAnd yet a surprising number of founders seem willing to assume that someone, they\\'re not sure \\nexactly who, will want what they\\'re building. Do the founders want it? No, they\\'re not the target \\nmarket. Who is? Teenagers. People interested in local events (that one is a perennial tarpit). Or \\n\"business\" users. What business users? Gas stations? Movie studios? Defense contractors?\\nYou can of course build something for users other than yourself. We did. But you should realize \\nyou\\'re stepping into dangerous territory. You\\'re flying on instruments, in effect, so you should (a) \\nconsciously shift gears, instead of assuming you can rely on your intuitions as you ordinarily \\nwould, and (b) look at the instruments.\\nIn this case the instruments are the users. When designing for other people you have to be \\nempirical. You can no longer guess what will work; you have to find users and measure their \\nresponses. So if you\\'re ', 'ase the instruments are the users. When designing for other people you have to be \\nempirical. You can no longer guess what will work; you have to find users and measure their \\nresponses. So if you\\'re going to make something for teenagers or \"business\" users or some \\nother group that doesn\\'t include you, you have to be able to talk some specific ones into using \\nwhat you\\'re making. If you can\\'t, you\\'re on the wrong track.\\n11. Raising Too Little Money\\nMost successful startups take funding at some point. Like having more than one founder, it \\nseems a good bet statistically. How much should you take, though?\\nStartup funding is measured in time. Every startup that isn\\'t profitable (meaning nearly all of \\nthem, initially) has a certain amount of time left before the money runs out and they have to \\nstop. This is sometimes referred to as runway, as in \"How much runway do you have left?\" It\\'s a \\ngood metaphor because it reminds you that when the money runs out you\\'re going to be \\nairborne or d', 'to \\nstop. This is sometimes referred to as runway, as in \"How much runway do you have left?\" It\\'s a \\ngood metaphor because it reminds you that when the money runs out you\\'re going to be \\nairborne or dead.\\nToo little money means not enough to get airborne. What airborne means depends on the \\nsituation. Usually you have to advance to a visibly higher level: if all you have is an idea, a \\nworking prototype; if you have a prototype, launching; if you\\'re launched, significant growth. It \\ndepends on investors, because until you\\'re profitable that\\'s who you have to convince.\\nSo if you take money from investors, you have to take enough to get to the next step, whatever \\nthat is. [5] Fortunately you have some control over both how much you spend and what the next \\nstep is. We advise startups to set both low, initially: spend practically nothing, and make your \\ninitial goal simply to build a solid prototype. This gives you maximum flexibility.\\n12. Spending Too Much\\nIt\\'s hard to distinguish spend', \" both low, initially: spend practically nothing, and make your \\ninitial goal simply to build a solid prototype. This gives you maximum flexibility.\\n12. Spending Too Much\\nIt's hard to distinguish spending too much from raising too little. If you run out of money, you \\ncould say either was the cause. The only way to decide which to call it is by comparison with \\nother startups. If you raised five million and ran out of money, you probably spent too much.\\nBurning through too much money is not as common as it used to be. Founders seem to have \\nlearned that lesson. Plus it keeps getting cheaper to start a startup. So as of this writing few \\nstartups spend too much. None of the ones we've funded have. (And not just because we make \\nsmall investments; many have gone on to raise further rounds.)\\nThe classic way to burn through cash is by hiring a lot of people. This bites you twice: in \\naddition to increasing your costs, it slows you down—so money that's getting consumed faster \\nhas to last lo\", 'he classic way to burn through cash is by hiring a lot of people. This bites you twice: in \\naddition to increasing your costs, it slows you down—so money that\\'s getting consumed faster \\nhas to last longer. Most hackers understand why that happens; Fred Brooks explained it in The \\nMythical Man-Month.\\nWe have three general suggestions about hiring: (a) don\\'t do it if you can avoid it, (b) pay \\npeople with equity rather than salary, not just to save money, but because you want the kind of \\npeople who are committed enough to prefer that, and (c) only hire people who are either going \\nto write code or go out and get users, because those are the only things you need at first.\\n13. Raising Too Much Money\\nIt\\'s obvious how too little money could kill you, but is there such a thing as having too much?\\nYes and no. The problem is not so much the money itself as what comes with it. As one VC who \\nspoke at Y Combinator said, \"Once you take several million dollars of my money, the clock is \\nticking.\" ', '?\\nYes and no. The problem is not so much the money itself as what comes with it. As one VC who \\nspoke at Y Combinator said, \"Once you take several million dollars of my money, the clock is \\nticking.\" If VCs fund you, they\\'re not going to let you just put the money in the bank and keep \\noperating as two guys living on ramen. They want that money to go to work. [6] At the very least \\nyou\\'ll move into proper office space and hire more people. That will change the atmosphere, \\nand not entirely for the better. Now most of your people will be employees rather than founders. \\nThey won\\'t be as committed; they\\'ll need to be told what to do; they\\'ll start to engage in office \\npolitics.\\nWhen you raise a lot of money, your company moves to the suburbs and has kids.\\nPerhaps more dangerously, once you take a lot of money it gets harder to change direction. \\nSuppose your initial plan was to sell something to companies. After taking VC money you hire a \\nsales force to do that. What happens now if you ', \"ake a lot of money it gets harder to change direction. \\nSuppose your initial plan was to sell something to companies. After taking VC money you hire a \\nsales force to do that. What happens now if you realize you should be making this for \\nconsumers instead of businesses? That's a completely different kind of selling. What happens, \\nin practice, is that you don't realize that. The more people you have, the more you stay pointed \\nin the same direction.\\nAnother drawback of large investments is the time they take. The time required to raise money \\ngrows with the amount. [7] When the amount rises into the millions, investors get very cautious. \\nVCs never quite say yes or no; they just engage you in an apparently endless conversation. \\nRaising VC scale investments is thus a huge time sink — more work, probably, than the startup \\nitself. And you don't want to be spending all your time talking to investors while your competitors \\nare spending theirs building things.\\nWe advise founders who go o\", \" work, probably, than the startup \\nitself. And you don't want to be spending all your time talking to investors while your competitors \\nare spending theirs building things.\\nWe advise founders who go on to seek VC money to take the first reasonable deal they get. If \\nyou get an offer from a reputable firm at a reasonable valuation with no unusually onerous \\nterms, just take it and get on with building the company. [8] Who cares if you could get a 30% \\nbetter deal elsewhere? Economically, startups are an all-or-nothing game. Bargain-hunting \\namong investors is a waste of time.\\n14. Poor Investor Management\\nAs a founder, you have to manage your investors. You shouldn't ignore them, because they may \\nhave useful insights. But neither should you let them run the company. That's supposed to be \\nyour job. If investors had sufficient vision to run the companies they fund, why didn't they start \\nthem?\\nPissing off investors by ignoring them is probably less dangerous than caving in to them. In ou\", \"our job. If investors had sufficient vision to run the companies they fund, why didn't they start \\nthem?\\nPissing off investors by ignoring them is probably less dangerous than caving in to them. In our \\nstartup, we erred on the ignoring side. A lot of our energy got drained away in disputes with \\ninvestors instead of going into the product. But this was less costly than giving in, which would \\nprobably have destroyed the company. If the founders know what they're doing, it's better to \\nhave half their attention focused on the product than the full attention of investors who don't.\\nHow hard you have to work on managing investors usually depends on how much money \\nyou've taken. When you raise VC-scale money, the investors get a great deal of control. If they \\nhave a board majority, they're literally your bosses. In the more common case, where founders \\nand investors are equally represented and the deciding vote is cast by neutral outside directors, \\nall the investors have to do is convin\", \"iterally your bosses. In the more common case, where founders \\nand investors are equally represented and the deciding vote is cast by neutral outside directors, \\nall the investors have to do is convince the outside directors and they control the company.\\nIf things go well, this shouldn't matter. So long as you seem to be advancing rapidly, most \\ninvestors will leave you alone. But things don't always go smoothly in startups. Investors have \\nmade trouble even for the most successful companies. One of the most famous examples is \\nApple, whose board made a nearly fatal blunder in firing Steve Jobs. Apparently even Google \\ngot a lot of grief from their investors early on.\\n15. Sacrificing Users to (Supposed) Profit\\nWhen I said at the beginning that if you make something users want, you'll be fine, you may \\nhave noticed I didn't mention anything about having the right business model.

Get funded by Y Combinator. \\n October 2006\\n(This essay is derived from a talk at MIT.)\\nTill recently graduating seniors had two choices: get a job or go to grad school. I think there will \\nincreasingly be a third option: to start your own startup. But how common will that be?\\nI'm sure the default will always be to get a job, but starting a startup could well become as \\npopular as grad school. In the late 90s my professor friends used to complain that they couldn't \\nget grad students, because all the undergrads were going to work for startups. I wouldn't be \\nsurprised if that situation returns, but with one difference: this time they'll be starting their own \\ninstead of going to work for other people's.\\nThe most ambitious students will at this point be asking: Why wait till you graduate? Why not \\nstart a startup while you're in college? In fact, why go to college at all? Why not start a startup \\ninstead?\\nA year and a half ago I g\", \"ll at this point be asking: Why wait till you graduate? Why not \\nstart a startup while you're in college? In fact, why go to college at all? Why not start a startup \\ninstead?\\nA year and a half ago I gave a talk where I said that the average age of the founders of Yahoo, \\nGoogle, and Microsoft was 24, and that if grad students could start startups, why not \\nundergrads? I'm glad I phrased that as a question, because now I can pretend it wasn't merely \\na rhetorical one. At the time I couldn't imagine why there should be any lower limit for the age of \\nstartup founders. Graduation is a bureaucratic change, not a biological one. And certainly there \\nare undergrads as competent technically as most grad students. So why shouldn't undergrads \\nbe able to start startups as well as grad students?\\nI now realize that something does change at graduation: you lose a huge excuse for failing. \\nRegardless of how complex your life is, you'll find that everyone else, including your family and \\nfriends, wi\", \"ow realize that something does change at graduation: you lose a huge excuse for failing. \\nRegardless of how complex your life is, you'll find that everyone else, including your family and \\nfriends, will discard all the low bits and regard you as having a single occupation at any given \\ntime. If you're in college and have a summer job writing software, you still read as a student. \\nWhereas if you graduate and get a job programming, you'll be instantly regarded by everyone \\nas a programmer.\\nThe problem with starting a startup while you're still in school is that there's a built-in escape \\nhatch. If you start a startup in the summer between your junior and senior year, it reads to \\neveryone as a summer job. So if it goes nowhere, big deal; you return to school in the fall with \\nall the other seniors; no one regards you as a failure, because your occupation is student, and \\nyou didn't fail at that. Whereas if you start a startup just one year later, after you graduate, as \\nlong as you're n\", \"seniors; no one regards you as a failure, because your occupation is student, and \\nyou didn't fail at that. Whereas if you start a startup just one year later, after you graduate, as \\nlong as you're not accepted to grad school in the fall the startup reads to everyone as your \\noccupation. You're now a startup founder, so you have to do well at that.\\nFor nearly everyone, the opinion of one's peers is the most powerful motivator of all—more \\npowerful even than the nominal goal of most startup founders, getting rich. [1] About a month \\ninto each funding cycle we have an event called Prototype Day where each startup presents to \\nthe others what they've got so far. You might think they wouldn't need any more motivation. \\nThey're working on their cool new idea; they have funding for the immediate future; and they're \\nplaying a game with only two outcomes: wealth or failure. You'd think that would be motivation \\nenough.

You'd think that would be motivation \\nenough. And yet the prospect of a demo pushes most of them into a rush of activity.\\nEven if you start a startup explicitly to get rich, the money you might get seems pretty \\ntheoretical most of the time. What drives you day to day is not wanting to look bad.\\nYou probably can't change that. Even if you could, I don't think you'd want to; someone who \\nreally, truly doesn't care what his peers think of him is probably a psychopath. So the best you \\ncan do is consider this force like a wind, and set up your boat accordingly. If you know your \\npeers are going to push you in some direction, choose good peers, and position yourself so \\nthey push you in a direction you like.\\nGraduation changes the prevailing winds, and those make a difference. Starting a startup is so \\nhard that it's a close call even for the ones that succeed.

Starting a startup is so \\nhard that it's a close call even for the ones that succeed. However high a startup may be flying \\nnow, it probably has a few leaves stuck in the landing gear from those trees it barely cleared at \\nthe end of the runway. In such a close game, the smallest increase in the forces against you \\ncan be enough to flick you over the edge into failure.\\nWhen we first started Y Combinator we encouraged people to start startups while they were \\nstill in college. That's partly because Y Combinator began as a kind of summer program. We've \\nkept the program shape—all of us having dinner together once a week turns out to be a good \\nidea—but we've decided now that the party line should be to tell people to wait till they graduate.\\nDoes that mean you can't start a startup in college? Not at all. Sam Altman, the co-founder of \\nLoopt, had just finished his sophomore year when we funded them, and Loopt is probably th\", 'they graduate.\\nDoes that mean you can\\'t start a startup in college? Not at all. Sam Altman, the co-founder of \\nLoopt, had just finished his sophomore year when we funded them, and Loopt is probably the \\nmost promising of all the startups we\\'ve funded so far. But Sam Altman is a very unusual guy. \\nWithin about three minutes of meeting him, I remember thinking \"Ah, so this is what Bill Gates \\nmust have been like when he was 19.\"\\nIf it can work to start a startup during college, why do we tell people not to? For the same \\nreason that the probably apocryphal violinist, whenever he was asked to judge someone\\'s \\nplaying, would always say they didn\\'t have enough talent to make it as a pro. Succeeding as a \\nmusician takes determination as well as talent, so this answer works out to be the right advice \\nfor everyone. The ones who are uncertain believe it and give up, and the ones who are \\nsufficiently determined think \"screw that, I\\'ll succeed anyway.\"\\nSo our official policy now is only to fund', 'vice \\nfor everyone. The ones who are uncertain believe it and give up, and the ones who are \\nsufficiently determined think \"screw that, I\\'ll succeed anyway.\"\\nSo our official policy now is only to fund undergrads we can\\'t talk out of it. And frankly, if you\\'re \\nnot certain, you should wait. It\\'s not as if all the opportunities to start companies are going to be \\ngone if you don\\'t do it now. Maybe the window will close on some idea you\\'re working on, but \\nthat won\\'t be the last idea you\\'ll have. For every idea that times out, new ones become feasible. \\nHistorically the opportunities to start startups have only increased with time.\\nIn that case, you might ask, why not wait longer? Why not go work for a while, or go to grad \\nschool, and then start a startup? And indeed, that might be a good idea. If I had to pick the \\nsweet spot for startup founders, based on who we\\'re most excited to see applications from, I\\'d \\nsay it\\'s probably the mid-twenties. Why?

If I had to pick the \\nsweet spot for startup founders, based on who we're most excited to see applications from, I'd \\nsay it's probably the mid-twenties. Why? What advantages does someone in their mid-twenties \\nhave over someone who's 21? And why isn't it older? What can 25 year olds do that 32 year \\nolds can't? Those turn out to be questions worth examining.\\nPlus\\nIf you start a startup soon after college, you'll be a young founder by present standards, so you \\nshould know what the relative advantages of young founders are. They're not what you might \\nthink. As a young founder your strengths are: stamina, poverty, rootlessness, colleagues, and \\nignorance.\\nThe importance of stamina shouldn't be surprising. If you've heard anything about startups \\nyou've probably heard about the long hours. As far as I can tell these are universal. I can't think \\nof any successful startups whose founders worked 9 to 5. And it's particularly necessary for \\nyounger founders to work long hours because t\", \"rs. As far as I can tell these are universal. I can't think \\nof any successful startups whose founders worked 9 to 5. And it's particularly necessary for \\nyounger founders to work long hours because they're probably not as efficient as they'll be later.\\nYour second advantage, poverty, might not sound like an advantage, but it is a huge one. \\nPoverty implies you can live cheaply, and this is critically important for startups. Nearly every \\nstartup that fails, fails by running out of money. It's a little misleading to put it this way, because \\nthere's usually some other underlying cause. But regardless of the source of your problems, a \\nlow burn rate gives you more opportunity to recover from them. And since most startups make \\nall kinds of mistakes at first, room to recover from mistakes is a valuable thing to have.\\nMost startups end up doing something different than they planned.

The way the successful \\nones find something that works is by trying things that don't. So the worst thing you can do in a \\nstartup is to have a rigid, pre-ordained plan and then start spending a lot of money to \\nimplement it. Better to operate cheaply and give your ideas time to evolve.\\nRecent grads can live on practically nothing, and this gives you an edge over older founders, \\nbecause the main cost in software startups is people. The guys with kids and mortgages are at \\na real disadvantage. This is one reason I'd bet on the 25 year old over the 32 year old. The 32 \\nyear old probably is a better programmer, but probably also has a much more expensive life. \\nWhereas a 25 year old has some work experience (more on that later) but can live as cheaply \\nas an undergrad.\\nRobert Morris and I were 29 and 30 respectively when we started Viaweb, but fortunately we \\nstill lived like 23 year olds.

We both had roughly zero assets. I would have loved to have a \\nmortgage, since that would have meant I had a house. But in retrospect having nothing turned \\nout to be convenient. I wasn't tied down and I was used to living cheaply.\\nEven more important than living cheaply, though, is thinking cheaply. One reason the Apple II \\nwas so popular was that it was cheap. The computer itself was cheap, and it used cheap, off-\\nthe-shelf peripherals like a cassette tape recorder for data storage and a TV as a monitor. And \\nyou know why? Because Woz designed this computer for himself, and he couldn't afford \\nanything more.\\nWe benefitted from the same phenomenon. Our prices were daringly low for the time. The top \\nlevel of service was $300 a month, which was an order of magnitude below the norm. In \\nretrospec\", \"thing more.\\nWe benefitted from the same phenomenon. Our prices were daringly low for the time. The top \\nlevel of service was $300 a month, which was an order of magnitude below the norm. In \\nretrospect this was a smart move, but we didn't do it because we were smart. $300 a month \\nseemed like a lot of money to us. Like Apple, we created something inexpensive, and therefore \\npopular, simply because we were poor.\\nA lot of startups have that form: someone comes along and makes something for a tenth or a \\nhundredth of what it used to cost, and the existing players can't follow because they don't even \\nwant to think about a world in which that's possible. Traditional long distance carriers, for \\nexample, didn't even want to think about VoIP\\n. (It was coming, all the same.) Being poor helps in \\nthis game, because your own personal bias points in the same direction technology evolves in.\\nThe advantages of rootlessness are similar to those of poverty.

When you're young you're more \\nmobile—not just because you don't have a house or much stuff, but also because you're less \\nlikely to have serious relationships. This turns out to be important, because a lot of startups \\ninvolve someone moving.\\nThe founders of Kiko, for example, are now en route to the Bay Area to start their next startup. \\nIt's a better place for what they want to do. And it was easy for them to decide to go, because \\nneither as far as I know has a serious girlfriend, and everything they own will fit in one car—or \\nmore precisely, will either fit in one car or is crappy enough that they don't mind leaving it \\nbehind.\\nThey at least were in Boston.

It couldn't be any other way. The kind of conversations we have with founders, we \\nhave to have in person. We fund a dozen startups at a time, and we can't be in a dozen places \\nat once. But even if we could somehow magically save people from moving, we wouldn't. We \\nwouldn't be doing founders a favor by letting them stay in Nebraska. Places that aren't startup \\nhubs are toxic to startups. You can tell that from indirect evidence. You can tell how hard it must \\nbe to start a startup in Houston or Chicago or Miami from the microscopically small number, per \\ncapita, that succeed there.

And that \\nis another area where undergrads have an edge. They\\'re surrounded by people willing to say \\nthat. At a good college you\\'re concentrated together with a lot of other ambitious and technically \\nminded people—probably more concentrated than you\\'ll ever be again. If your nucleus spits out \\na neutron, there\\'s a good chance it will hit another nucleus.\\nThe number one question people ask us at Y Combinator is: Where can I find a co-founder? \\nThat\\'s the biggest problem for someone starting a startup at 30. When they were in school they \\nknew a lot of good co-founders, but by 30 they\\'ve either lost touch with them or these people \\nare tied down by jobs they don\\'t want to leave.\\nViaweb was an anomaly', \" 30. When they were in school they \\nknew a lot of good co-founders, but by 30 they've either lost touch with them or these people \\nare tied down by jobs they don't want to leave.\\nViaweb was an anomaly in this respect too. Though we were comparatively old, we weren't tied \\ndown by impressive jobs. I was trying to be an artist, which is not very constraining, and Robert, \\nthough 29, was still in grad school due to a little interruption in his academic career back in \\n1988. So arguably the Worm made Viaweb possible. Otherwise Robert would have been a \\njunior professor at that age, and he wouldn't have had time to work on crazy speculative \\nprojects with me.\\nMost of the questions people ask Y Combinator we have some kind of answer for, but not the \\nco-founder question.

A lot of startups grow out of schools for this reason. Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft, among \\nothers, were all founded by people who met in school. (In Microsoft's case, it was high school.)\\nMany students feel they should wait and get a little more experience before they start a \\ncompany. All other things being equal, they should.

Another is to work for a company located in a startup hub.

You'll either end up rich, \\nin which case problem solved, or the startup will get bought, in which case it it will start to suck \\nto work there and it will be easy to leave, or most likely, the thing will blow up and you'll be free \\nagain.\\nYour final advantage, ignorance, may not sound very useful. I deliberately used a controversial \\nword for it; you might equally call it innocence. But it seems to be a powerful force. My Y \\nCombinator co-founder Jessica Livingston is just about to publish a book of interviews with \\nstartup founders, and I noticed a remarkable pattern in them. One after another said that if \\nthey'd known how hard it would be, they wou\", \"Livingston is just about to publish a book of interviews with \\nstartup founders, and I noticed a remarkable pattern in them. One after another said that if \\nthey'd known how hard it would be, they would have been too intimidated to start.\\nIgnorance can be useful when it's a counterweight to other forms of stupidity. It's useful in \\nstarting startups because you're capable of more than you realize. Starting startups is harder \\nthan you expect, but you're also capable of more than you expect, so they balance out.\\nMost people look at a company like Apple and think, how could I ever make such a thing? \\nApple is an institution, and I'm just a person. But every institution was at one point just a handful \\nof people in a room deciding to start something. Institutions are made up, and made up by \\npeople no different from you.\\nI'm not saying everyone could start a startup. I'm sure most people couldn't; I don't know much \\nabout the population at large. When you get to groups I know well, like h\", 'people no different from you.\\nI\\'m not saying everyone could start a startup. I\\'m sure most people couldn\\'t; I don\\'t know much \\nabout the population at large. When you get to groups I know well, like hackers, I can say more \\nprecisely. At the top schools, I\\'d guess as many as a quarter of the CS majors could make it as \\nstartup founders if they wanted.\\nThat \"if they wanted\" is an important qualification—so important that it\\'s almost cheating to \\nappend it like that—because once you get over a certain threshold of intelligence, which most \\nCS majors at top schools are past, the deciding factor in whether you succeed as a founder is \\nhow much you want to. You don\\'t have to be that smart. If you\\'re not a genius, just start a \\nstartup in some unsexy field where you\\'ll have less competition, like software for human \\nresources departments. I picked that example at random, but I feel safe in predicting that \\nwhatever they have now, it wouldn\\'t take genius to do better. There are a lot of peopl', \"e software for human \\nresources departments. I picked that example at random, but I feel safe in predicting that \\nwhatever they have now, it wouldn't take genius to do better. There are a lot of people out there \\nworking on boring stuff who are desperately in need of better software, so however short you \\nthink you fall of Larry and Sergey, you can ratchet down the coolness of the idea far enough to \\ncompensate.\\nAs well as preventing you from being intimidated, ignorance can sometimes help you discover \\nnew ideas. Steve Wozniak put this very strongly: All the best things that I did at Apple came \\nfrom (a) not having money and (b) not having done it before, ever. Every single thing that we \\ncame out with that was really great, I'd never once done that thing in my life. When you know \\nnothing, you have to reinvent stuff for yourself, and if you're smart your reinventions may be \\nbetter than what preceded them. This is especially true in fields where the rules change. All our \\nideas about\", \"g, you have to reinvent stuff for yourself, and if you're smart your reinventions may be \\nbetter than what preceded them. This is especially true in fields where the rules change. All our \\nideas about software were developed in a time when processors were slow, and memories and \\ndisks were tiny. Who knows what obsolete assumptions are embedded in the conventional \\nwisdom? And the way these assumptions are going to get fixed is not by explicitly deallocating \\nthem, but by something more akin to garbage collection. Someone ignorant but smart will come \\nalong and reinvent everything, and in the process simply fail to reproduce certain existing ideas.\\nMinus\\nSo much for the advantages of young founders. What about the disadvantages? I'm going to \\nstart with what goes wrong and try to trace it back to the root causes.\\nWhat goes wrong with young founders is that they build stuff that looks like class projects. It \\nwas only recently that we figured this out ourselves. We noticed a lot of simil\", \"ack to the root causes.\\nWhat goes wrong with young founders is that they build stuff that looks like class projects. It \\nwas only recently that we figured this out ourselves. We noticed a lot of similarities between the \\nstartups that seemed to be falling behind, but we couldn't figure out how to put it into words. \\nThen finally we realized what it was: they were building class projects.\\nBut what does that really mean? What's wrong with class projects? What's the difference \\nbetween a class project and a real startup? If we could answer that question it would be useful \\nnot just to would-be startup founders but to students in general, because we'd be a long way \\ntoward explaining the mystery of the so-called real world.\\nThere seem to be two big things missing in class projects: (1) an iterative definition of a real \\nproblem and (2) intensity.\\nThe first is probably unavoidable. Class projects will inevitably solve fake problems. For one \\nthing, real problems are rare and valuable. If a \", 'ative definition of a real \\nproblem and (2) intensity.\\nThe first is probably unavoidable. Class projects will inevitably solve fake problems. For one \\nthing, real problems are rare and valuable. If a professor wanted to have students solve real \\nproblems, he\\'d face the same paradox as someone trying to give an example of whatever \\n\"paradigm\" might succeed the Standard Model of physics. There may well be something that \\ndoes, but if you could think of an example you\\'d be entitled to the Nobel Prize. Similarly, good \\nnew problems are not to be had for the asking.\\nIn technology the difficulty is compounded by the fact that real startups tend to discover the \\nproblem they\\'re solving by a process of evolution. Someone has an idea for something; they \\nbuild it; and in doing so (and probably only by doing so) they realize the problem they should be \\nsolving is another one. Even if the professor let you change your project description on the fly, \\nthere isn\\'t time enough to do that in a colleg', \" by doing so) they realize the problem they should be \\nsolving is another one. Even if the professor let you change your project description on the fly, \\nthere isn't time enough to do that in a college class, or a market to supply evolutionary \\npressures. So class projects are mostly about implementation, which is the least of your \\nproblems in a startup.\\nIt's not just that in a startup you work on the idea as well as implementation. The very \\nimplementation is different. Its main purpose is to refine the idea. Often the only value of most \\nof the stuff you build in the first six months is that it proves your initial idea was mistaken. And \\nthat's extremely valuable. If you're free of a misconception that everyone else still shares, you're \\nin a powerful position. But you're not thinking that way about a class project. Proving your initial \\nplan was mistaken would just get you a bad grade. Instead of building stuff to throw away, you \\ntend to want every line of code to go toward that f\", 'hat way about a class project. Proving your initial \\nplan was mistaken would just get you a bad grade. Instead of building stuff to throw away, you \\ntend to want every line of code to go toward that final goal of showing you did a lot of work.\\nThat leads to our second difference: the way class projects are measured. Professors will tend \\nto judge you by the distance between the starting point and where you are now. If someone has \\nachieved a lot, they should get a good grade. But customers will judge you from the other \\ndirection: the distance remaining between where you are now and the features they need. The \\nmarket doesn\\'t give a shit how hard you worked. Users just want your software to do what they \\nneed, and you get a zero otherwise. That is one of the most distinctive differences between \\nschool and the real world: there is no reward for putting in a good effort. In fact, the whole \\nconcept of a \"good effort\" is a fake idea adults invented to encourage kids. It is not found in \\n', 'tween \\nschool and the real world: there is no reward for putting in a good effort. In fact, the whole \\nconcept of a \"good effort\" is a fake idea adults invented to encourage kids. It is not found in \\nnature.\\nSuch lies seem to be helpful to kids. But unfortunately when you graduate they don\\'t give you a \\nlist of all the lies they told you during your education. You have to get them beaten out of you by \\ncontact with the real world. And this is why so many jobs want work experience. I couldn\\'t \\nunderstand that when I was in college. I knew how to program. In fact, I could tell I knew how to \\nprogram better than most people doing it for a living. So what was this mysterious \"work \\nexperience\" and why did I need it?\\nNow I know what it is, and part of the confusion is grammatical. Describing it as \"work \\nexperience\" implies it\\'s like experience operating a certain kind of machine, or using a certain \\nprogramming language. But really what work experience refers to is not some specific \\nexper', ' as \"work \\nexperience\" implies it\\'s like experience operating a certain kind of machine, or using a certain \\nprogramming language. But really what work experience refers to is not some specific \\nexpertise, but the elimination of certain habits left over from childhood.\\nOne of the defining qualities of kids is that they flake. When you\\'re a kid and you face some \\nhard test, you can cry and say \"I can\\'t\" and they won\\'t make you do it. Of course, no one can \\nmake you do anything in the grownup world either. What they do instead is fire you. And when \\nmotivated by that you find you can do a lot more than you realized. So one of the things \\nemployers expect from someone with \"work experience\" is the elimination of the flake reflex—\\nthe ability to get things done, with no excuses.\\nThe other thing you get from work experience is an understanding of what work is, and in \\nparticular, how intrinsically horrible it is. Fundamentally the equation is a brutal one: you have to \\nspend most of your wa', 'g you get from work experience is an understanding of what work is, and in \\nparticular, how intrinsically horrible it is. Fundamentally the equation is a brutal one: you have to \\nspend most of your waking hours doing stuff someone else wants, or starve. There are a few \\nplaces where the work is so interesting that this is concealed, because what other people want \\ndone happens to coincide with what you want to work on. But you only have to imagine what \\nwould happen if they diverged to see the underlying reality.\\nIt\\'s not so much that adults lie to kids about this as never explain it. They never explain what the \\ndeal is with money. You know from an early age that you\\'ll have some sort of job, because \\neveryone asks what you\\'re going to \"be\" when you grow up. What they don\\'t tell you is that as a \\nkid you\\'re sitting on the shoulders of someone else who\\'s treading water, and that starting \\nworking means you get thrown into the water on your own, and have to start treading water \\nyoursel', 'at as a \\nkid you\\'re sitting on the shoulders of someone else who\\'s treading water, and that starting \\nworking means you get thrown into the water on your own, and have to start treading water \\nyourself or sink. \"Being\" something is incidental; the immediate problem is not to drown.\\nThe relationship between work and money tends to dawn on you only gradually. At least it did \\nfor me. One\\'s first thought tends to be simply \"This sucks. I\\'m in debt. Plus I have to get up on \\nmonday and go to work.\" Gradually you realize that these two things are as tightly connected as \\nonly a market can make them.\\nSo the most important advantage 24 year old founders have over 20 year old founders is that \\nthey know what they\\'re trying to avoid. To the average undergrad the idea of getting rich \\ntranslates into buying Ferraris, or being admired. To someone who has learned from experience \\nabout the relationship between money and work, it translates to something way more important: \\nit means you get to opt ', \"o buying Ferraris, or being admired. To someone who has learned from experience \\nabout the relationship between money and work, it translates to something way more important: \\nit means you get to opt out of the brutal equation that governs the lives of 99.9% of people. \\nGetting rich means you can stop treading water.\\nSomeone who gets this will work much harder at making a startup succeed—with the proverbial \\nenergy of a drowning man, in fact. But understanding the relationship between money and work \\nalso changes the way you work. You don't get money just for working, but for doing things other \\npeople want. Someone who's figured that out will automatically focus more on the user. And \\nthat cures the other half of the class-project syndrome. After you've been working for a while, \\nyou yourself tend to measure what you've done the same way the market does.\\nOf course, you don't have to spend years working to learn this stuff. If you're sufficiently \\nperceptive you can grasp these things \", 'self tend to measure what you\\'ve done the same way the market does.\\nOf course, you don\\'t have to spend years working to learn this stuff. If you\\'re sufficiently \\nperceptive you can grasp these things while you\\'re still in school. Sam Altman did. He must \\nhave, because Loopt is no class project. And as his example suggests, this can be valuable \\nknowledge. At a minimum, if you get this stuff, you already have most of what you gain from the \\n\"work experience\" employers consider so desirable. But of course if you really get it, you can \\nuse this information in a way that\\'s more valuable to you than that.\\nNow\\nSo suppose you think you might start a startup at some point, either when you graduate or a \\nfew years after. What should you do now? For both jobs and grad school, there are ways to \\nprepare while you\\'re in college. If you want to get a job when you graduate, you should get \\nsummer jobs at places you\\'d like to work. If you want to go to grad school, it will help to work on \\nresearch ', \"pare while you're in college. If you want to get a job when you graduate, you should get \\nsummer jobs at places you'd like to work. If you want to go to grad school, it will help to work on \\nresearch projects as an undergrad. What's the equivalent for startups? How do you keep your \\noptions maximally open?\\nOne thing you can do while you're still in school is to learn how startups work. Unfortunately \\nthat's not easy. Few if any colleges have classes about startups. There may be business school \\nclasses on entrepreneurship, as they call it over there, but these are likely to be a waste of time. \\nBusiness schools like to talk about startups, but philosophically they're at the opposite end of \\nthe spectrum. Most books on startups also seem to be useless. I've looked at a few and none \\nget it right. Books in most fields are written by people who know the subject from experience, \\nbut for startups there's a unique problem: by definition the founders of successful startups don't \\nneed to wri\", \"right. Books in most fields are written by people who know the subject from experience, \\nbut for startups there's a unique problem: by definition the founders of successful startups don't \\nneed to write books to make money. As a result most books on the subject end up being written \\nby people who don't understand it.\\nSo I'd be skeptical of classes and books. The way to learn about startups is by watching them \\nin action, preferably by working at one. How do you do that as an undergrad? Probably by \\nsneaking in through the back door. Just hang around a lot and gradually start doing things for \\nthem. Most startups are (or should be) very cautious about hiring. Every hire increases the burn \\nrate, and bad hires early on are hard to recover from. However, startups usually have a fairly \\ninformal atmosphere, and there's always a lot that needs to be done. If you just start doing stuff \\nfor them, many will be too busy to shoo you away. You can thus gradually work your way into \\ntheir confide\", \"al atmosphere, and there's always a lot that needs to be done. If you just start doing stuff \\nfor them, many will be too busy to shoo you away. You can thus gradually work your way into \\ntheir confidence, and maybe turn it into an official job later, or not, whichever you prefer. This \\nwon't work for all startups, but it would work for most I've known.\\nNumber two, make the most of the great advantage of school: the wealth of co-founders. Look \\nat the people around you and ask yourself which you'd like to work with. When you apply that \\ntest, you may find you get surprising results. You may find you'd prefer the quiet guy you've \\nmostly ignored to someone who seems impressive but has an attitude to match. I'm not \\nsuggesting you suck up to people you don't really like because you think one day they'll be \\nsuccessful. Exactly the opposite, in fact: you should only start a startup with someone you like, \\nbecause a startup will put your friendship through a stress test. I'm just saying you\", \"day they'll be \\nsuccessful. Exactly the opposite, in fact: you should only start a startup with someone you like, \\nbecause a startup will put your friendship through a stress test. I'm just saying you should think \\nabout who you really admire and hang out with them, instead of whoever circumstances throw \\nyou together with.\\nAnother thing you can do is learn skills that will be useful to you in a startup. These may be \\ndifferent from the skills you'd learn to get a job. For example, thinking about getting a job will \\nmake you want to learn programming languages you think employers want, like Java and C++. \\nWhereas if you start a startup, you get to pick the language, so you have to think about which \\nwill actually let you get the most done. If you use that test you might end up learning Ruby or \\nPython instead.\\nBut the most important skill for a startup founder isn't a programming technique. It's a knack for \\nunderstanding users and figuring out how to give them what they want. I know I\", \"y or \\nPython instead.\\nBut the most important skill for a startup founder isn't a programming technique. It's a knack for \\nunderstanding users and figuring out how to give them what they want. I know I repeat this, but \\nthat's because it's so important. And it's a skill you can learn, though perhaps habit might be a \\nbetter word. Get into the habit of thinking of software as having users. What do those users \\nwant? What would make them say wow?\\nThis is particularly valuable for undergrads, because the concept of users is missing from most \\ncollege programming classes. The way you get taught programming in college would be like \\nteaching writing as grammar, without mentioning that its purpose is to communicate something \\nto an audience. Fortunately an audience for software is now only an http request away. So in \\naddition to the programming you do for your classes, why not build some kind of website people \\nwill find useful? At the very least it will teach you how to write software with \", \"p request away. So in \\naddition to the programming you do for your classes, why not build some kind of website people \\nwill find useful? At the very least it will teach you how to write software with users. In the best \\ncase, it might not just be preparation for a startup, but the startup itself, like it was for Yahoo and \\nGoogle.\\nNotes:\\n[1] Even the desire to protect one's children seems weaker, judging from things people have historically done to their \\nkids rather than risk their community's disapproval.

The average startup probably doesn't have much to show for itself \\nafter ten weeks. But the average startup fails. When you look at the ones that went on to do \\ngreat things, you find a lot that began with someone pounding out a prototype in a week or two \\nof nonstop work.

At other Y \\nCombinator events we allow outside guests, but not at Rehearsal Day.

We try to \\npick founders who are good at building things, not ones who are slick presenters.

Practically every successful startup, \\nincluding stars like Google, presented at some point to investors who didn't get it and turned \\nthem down. Was it because the founders were bad at presenting, or because the investors were \\nobtuse?

Explain what you\\'re doing.\\nInvestors\\' main question when judging a very early startup is whether you\\'ve made a \\ncompelling product. Before they can judge whether you\\'ve built a good x, they have to \\nunderstand what kind of x you\\'ve built. They will get very frustrated if instead of telling them \\nwhat you do, you make them sit through some kind of preamble.\\nSay what you\\'re doing as soon as possible, preferably in the first sentence. \"We\\'re Jeff and Bob \\nand we\\'ve built an easy to use web-based database.

Get rapidly to demo.\\nThis section is now obsolete for YC founders presenting at Demo Day, because Demo Day \\npresentations are now so short that they rarely include much if any demo. They seem to work \\njust as well without, however, which makes me think I was wrong to emphasize demos so much \\nbefore.\\nA demo explains what you\\'ve made more effectively than any verbal description. The only thing \\nworth talking about first is the problem you\\'re trying to solve and why it\\'s important. But don\\'t \\nspend more than a tenth of your time on that.

Better a narrow description than a vague one.\\nOne reason founders resist describing their projects concisely is that, at this early stage, there \\nare all kinds of possibilities. The most concise descriptions seem misleadingly narrow. So for \\nexample a group that has built an easy web-based database might resist calling their applicaton \\nthat, because \", ' kinds of possibilities.

In fact, it could be anything...\\nThe problem is, as you approach (in the calculus sense) a description of something that could \\nbe anything, the content of your description approaches zero. If you describe your web-based \\ndatabase as \"a system to allow people to collaboratively leverage the value of information,\" it \\nwill go in one investor ear and out the other. They\\'ll just discard that sentence as meaningless \\nboilerplate, and hope, with increasing impatience, that in the next sentence you\\'ll actually \\nexplain what you\\'ve made.\\nYour primary goal is not to describe everything your system might one day become, but simply \\nto convince investors you\\'re worth talking to further. So approach this like an algorithm that gets \\nthe right answer by successive approximati', 'everything your system might one day become, but simply \\nto convince investors you\\'re worth talking to further. So approach this like an algorithm that gets \\nthe right answer by successive approximations.

It\\'s the same principle as \\nincremental development: start with a simple prototype, then add features, but at every point \\nhave working code. In this case, \"working code\" means a working description in the investor\\'s \\nhead.\\n4. Don\\'t talk and drive.\\nHave one person talk while another uses the computer.

Don't talk about secondary matters at length.\\nIf you only have a few minutes, spend them explaining what your product does and why it's \\ngreat. Second order issues like competitors or resumes should be single slides you go through \\nquickly at the end. If you have impressive resumes, just flash them on the screen for 15 \\nseconds and say a few words. For competitors, list the top 3 and explain in one sentence each \\nwhat they lack that you have. And put this kind of thing at the end, after you've made it clear \\nwhat you've built.\\n6. Don't get too deeply into business models.\\nIt's good to talk about how you plan to make money, but mainly because it shows you care \\nabout that and have thought about it. Don't go into detail about your business model, because \\n(a) that's not what s\", \"ood to talk about how you plan to make money, but mainly because it shows you care \\nabout that and have thought about it.

(And yet he invested anyway, because he expected it to be crap at this stage.)\\nIf you're solving an important problem, you're going to sound a lot smarter talking about that \\nthan the business model.

Anything funny or gripping was ipso facto suspect, unless it was old enough \\nto be hard to understand, like Shakespeare or Chaucer. Mistake number two.

The result was that I wrote a lot of stories in which nothing happened except that \\nsomeone was unhappy in a way that seemed deep.\\nFor most of college I was a philosophy major. I was very impressed by the papers published in \\nphilosophy journals. They were so beautifully typeset, and their tone was just captivating—\\nalternately casual and buffer-overflowingly technical. A fellow would be walking along a street \\nand suddenly modality qua modality would spring upon him.

A fellow would be walking along a street \\nand suddenly modality qua modality would spring upon him. I didn\\'t ever quite understand these \\npapers, but I figured I\\'d get around to that later, when I had time to reread them more closely. In \\nthe meantime I tried my best to imitate them. This was, I can now see, a doomed undertaking, \\nbecause they weren\\'t really saying anything. No philosopher ever refuted another, for example, \\nbecause no one said anything definite enough to refute. Needless to say, my imitations didn\\'t \\nsay anything either.\\nIn grad school I was still wasting time imitating the wrong things. There was then a fashionable \\ntype of program called an expert system, at the core of which was something called an \\ninference engine. I looked at what these things did and thought \"I could write that in a thousand \\nlines of code.\" And yet eminent professors were writing books about them, and startups were \\nselling them for a year\\'s salary a copy. What an opportun', 'id and thought \"I could write that in a thousand \\nlines of code.\" And yet eminent professors were writing books about them, and startups were \\nselling them for a year\\'s salary a copy. What an opportunity, I thought; these impressive things \\nseem easy to me; I must be pretty sharp. Wrong. It was simply a fad. The books the professors \\nwrote about expert systems are now ignored. They were not even on a path to anything \\ninteresting. And the customers paying so much for them were largely the same government \\nagencies that paid thousands for screwdrivers and toilet seats.\\nHow do you avoid copying the wrong things?

I didn\\'t enjoy the short stories we had to read in English \\nclasses; I didn\\'t learn anything from philosophy papers; I didn\\'t use expert systems myself.

I \\nbelieved these things were good because they were admired.\\nIt can be hard to separate the things you like from the things you\\'re impressed with. One trick is \\nto ignore presentation. Whenever I see a painting impressively hung in a museum, I ask myself: \\nhow much would I pay for this if I found it at a garage sale, dirty and frameless, and with no idea \\nwho painted it? If you walk around a museum trying this experiment, you\\'ll find you get some \\ntruly startling results. Don\\'t ignore this data point just because it\\'s an outlier.\\nAnother way to figure out what you like is to look at what you enjoy as guilty pleasures. Many \\nthings people like, especially if they\\'re young and ambitious, they like largely for the feeling of \\nvirtue in liking them. 99% of people reading Ulysses are thinking \"I\\'m reading Ulysses\" as they \\ndo it.

That\\'s what you really like.\\nEven when you find genuinely good things to copy, there\\'s another pitfall to be avoided. Be \\ncareful to copy what makes them good, rather than their flaws. It\\'s easy to be drawn into \\nimitating flaws, because they\\'re easier to see, and of course easier to copy too. For example, \\nmost painters in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries used brownish colors.

But \\nin retrospect you're probably better off studying something moderately interesting with someone \\nwho's good at it than something very interesting with someone who isn't. You often hear people \\nsay that you shouldn't major in business in college, but this is actually an instance of a more \\ngeneral rule: don't learn things from teachers who are bad at them.\\nHow much you should worry about being an outsider depends on the quality of the insiders. If \\nyou're an amateur mathematician and think you've solved a famous open problem, better go \\nback and check. When I was in grad school, a friend in the math department had the job of \\nreplying to people who sent in proofs of Fermat's last theorem and so on, and it did not seem \\nas if he saw it as a valuable source of tips — more like manning a mental health hotline. \\nWhereas if the stuff you're writing seems diffe\", \"oofs of Fermat's last theorem and so on, and it did not seem \\nas if he saw it as a valuable source of tips — more like manning a mental health hotline. \\nWhereas if the stuff you're writing seems different from what English professors are interested \\nin, that's not necessarily a problem.\\nAnti-Tests\\nWhere the method of selecting the elite is thoroughly corrupt, most of the good people will be \\noutsiders. In art, for example, the image of the poor, misunderstood genius is not just one \\npossible image of a great artist: it's the standard image. I'm not saying it's correct, incidentally, \\nbut it is telling how well this image has stuck. You couldn't make a rap like that stick to math or \\nmedicine. [2]\\nIf it's corrupt enough, a test becomes an anti-test, filtering out the people it should select by \\nmaking them to do things only the wrong people would do. Popularity in high school seems to \\nbe such a test. There are plenty of similar ones in the grownup world. For example, rising up \\nthrough\", \" by \\nmaking them to do things only the wrong people would do. Popularity in high school seems to \\nbe such a test. There are plenty of similar ones in the grownup world. For example, rising up \\nthrough the hierarchy of the average big company demands an attention to politics few \\nthoughtful people could spare. [3] Someone like Bill Gates can grow a company under him, but \\nit's hard to imagine him having the patience to climb the corporate ladder at General Electric — \\nor Microsoft, actually.\\nIt's kind of strange when you think about it, because lord-of-the-flies schools and bureaucratic \\ncompanies are both the default. There are probably a lot of people who go from one to the other \\nand never realize the whole world doesn't work this way.\\nI think that's one reason big companies are so often blindsided by startups. People at big \\ncompanies don't realize the extent to which they live in an environment that is one large, \\nongoing test for the wrong qualities.\\nIf you're an outsider, your be\", \" blindsided by startups. People at big \\ncompanies don't realize the extent to which they live in an environment that is one large, \\nongoing test for the wrong qualities.\\nIf you're an outsider, your best chances for beating insiders are obviously in fields where corrupt \\ntests select a lame elite. But there's a catch: if the tests are corrupt, your victory won't be \\nrecognized, at least in your lifetime. You may feel you don't need that, but history suggests it's \\ndangerous to work in fields with corrupt tests. You may beat the insiders, and yet not do as \\ngood work, on an absolute scale, as you would in a field that was more honest.\\nStandards in art, for example, were almost as corrupt in the first half of the eighteenth century \\nas they are today. This was the era of those fluffy idealized portraits of countesses with their \\nlapdogs. Chardin decided to skip all that and paint ordinary things as he saw them. He's now \\nconsidered the best of that period — and yet not the equal of Leonar\", \"d portraits of countesses with their \\nlapdogs. Chardin decided to skip all that and paint ordinary things as he saw them. He's now \\nconsidered the best of that period — and yet not the equal of Leonardo or Bellini or Memling, \\nwho all had the additional encouragement of honest standards.\\nIt can be worth participating in a corrupt contest, however, if it's followed by another that isn't \\ncorrupt. For example, it would be worth competing with a company that can spend more than \\nyou on marketing, as long as you can survive to the next round, when customers compare your \\nactual products. Similarly, you shouldn't be discouraged by the comparatively corrupt test of \\ncollege admissions, because it's followed immediately by less hackable tests. [4]\\nRisk\\nEven in a field with honest tests, there are still advantages to being an outsider. The most \\nobvious is that outsiders have nothing to lose. They can do risky things, and if they fail, so \\nwhat? Few will even notice.\\nThe eminent, on the other \", \" still advantages to being an outsider. The most \\nobvious is that outsiders have nothing to lose. They can do risky things, and if they fail, so \\nwhat? Few will even notice.\\nThe eminent, on the other hand, are weighed down by their eminence. Eminence is like a suit: it \\nimpresses the wrong people, and it constrains the wearer.\\nOutsiders should realize the advantage they have here. Being able to take risks is hugely \\nvaluable. Everyone values safety too much, both the obscure and the eminent. No one wants to \\nlook like a fool. But it's very useful to be able to. If most of your ideas aren't stupid, you're \\nprobably being too conservative. You're not bracketing the problem.\\nLord Acton said we should judge talent at its best and character at its worst. For example, if you \\nwrite one great book and ten bad ones, you still count as a great writer — or at least, a better \\nwriter than someone who wrote eleven that were merely good. Whereas if you're a quiet, law-\\nabiding citizen most of the t\", 'k and ten bad ones, you still count as a great writer — or at least, a better \\nwriter than someone who wrote eleven that were merely good. Whereas if you\\'re a quiet, law-\\nabiding citizen most of the time but occasionally cut someone up and bury them in your \\nbackyard, you\\'re a bad guy.\\nAlmost everyone makes the mistake of treating ideas as if they were indications of character \\nrather than talent — as if having a stupid idea made you stupid. There\\'s a huge weight of \\ntradition advising us to play it safe. \"Even a fool is thought wise if he keeps silent,\" says the Old \\nTestament (Proverbs 17:28).\\nWell, that may be fine advice for a bunch of goatherds in Bronze Age Palestine. There \\nconservatism would be the order of the day. But times have changed. It might still be reasonable \\nto stick with the Old Testament in political questions, but materially the world now has a lot \\nmore state.

Tradition is less of a guide, not just because things change faster, but because the \\nspace of possibilities is so large. The more complicated the world gets, the more valuable it is to \\nbe willing to look like a fool.\\nDelegation\\nAnd yet the more successful people become, the more heat they get if they screw up — or even \\nseem to screw up. In this respect, as in many others, the eminent are prisoners of their own \\nsuccess. So the best way to understand the advantages of being an outsider may be to look at \\nthe disadvantages of being an insider.\\nIf you ask eminent people what's wrong with their lives, the first thing they'll complain about is \\nthe lack of time. A friend of mine at Google is fairly high up in the company and went to work for \\nthem long before they went public. In other words, he's now rich enough not to have to work. I \\nasked him if he could still endure the annoyances of havi\", \"y high up in the company and went to work for \\nthem long before they went public. In other words, he's now rich enough not to have to work. I \\nasked him if he could still endure the annoyances of having a job, now that he didn't have to. \\nAnd he said that there weren't really any annoyances, except — and he got a wistful look when \\nhe said this — that he got so much email.\\nThe eminent feel like everyone wants to take a bite out of them. The problem is so widespread \\nthat people pretending to be eminent do it by pretending to be overstretched.\\nThe lives of the eminent become scheduled, and that's not good for thinking. One of the great \\nadvantages of being an outsider is long, uninterrupted blocks of time. That's what I remember \\nabout grad school: apparently endless supplies of time, which I spent worrying about, but not \\nwriting, my dissertation. Obscurity is like health food — unpleasant, perhaps, but good for you. \\nWhereas fame tends to be like the alcohol produced by fermentation. \", \" I spent worrying about, but not \\nwriting, my dissertation. Obscurity is like health food — unpleasant, perhaps, but good for you. \\nWhereas fame tends to be like the alcohol produced by fermentation. When it reaches a certain \\nconcentration, it kills off the yeast that produced it.\\nThe eminent generally respond to the shortage of time by turning into managers. They don't \\nhave time to work. They're surrounded by junior people they're supposed to help or supervise. \\nThe obvious solution is to have the junior people do the work. Some good stuff happens this \\nway, but there are problems it doesn't work so well for: the kind where it helps to have \\neverything in one head.\\nFor example, it recently emerged that the famous glass artist Dale Chihuly hasn't actually blown \\nglass for 27 years. He has assistants do the work for him. But one of the most valuable sources \\nof ideas in the visual arts is the resistance of the medium. That's why oil paintings look so \\ndifferent from watercolors. In pr\", \"s assistants do the work for him. But one of the most valuable sources \\nof ideas in the visual arts is the resistance of the medium. That's why oil paintings look so \\ndifferent from watercolors. In principle you could make any mark in any medium; in practice the \\nmedium steers you. And if you're no longer doing the work yourself, you stop learning from this.\\nSo if you want to beat those eminent enough to delegate, one way to do it is to take advantage \\nof direct contact with the medium. In the arts it's obvious how: blow your own glass, edit your \\nown films, stage your own plays. And in the process pay close attention to accidents and to new \\nideas you have on the fly. This technique can be generalized to any sort of work: if you're an \\noutsider, don't be ruled by plans. Planning is often just a weakness forced on those who \\ndelegate.\\nIs there a general rule for finding problems best solved in one head?

Well, you can manufacture \\nthem by taking any project usually done by multiple people and trying to do it all yourself. \\nWozniak's work was a classic example: he did everything himself, hardware and software, and \\nthe result was miraculous. He claims not one bug was ever found in the Apple II, in either \\nhardware or software.\\nAnother way to find good problems to solve in one head is to focus on the grooves in the \\nchocolate bar — the places where tasks are divided when they're split between several people. \\nIf you want to beat delegation, focus on a vertical slice: for example, be both writer and editor, \\nor both design buildings and construct them.\\nOne especially good groove to span is the one between tools and things made with them. For \\nexample, programming languages and applications are usually written by different people, and \\nthis is responsible for a lot of the wo\", \"e to span is the one between tools and things made with them. For \\nexample, programming languages and applications are usually written by different people, and \\nthis is responsible for a lot of the worst flaws in programming languages. I think every language \\nshould be designed simultaneously with a large application written in it, the way C was with \\nUnix.\\nTechniques for competing with delegation translate well into business, because delegation is \\nendemic there. Instead of avoiding it as a drawback of senility, many companies embrace it as a \\nsign of maturity. In big companies software is often designed, implemented, and sold by three \\nseparate types of people. In startups one person may have to do all three. And though this feels \\nstressful, it's one reason startups win. The needs of customers and the means of satisfying \\nthem are all in one head.\\nFocus\\nThe very skill of insiders can be a weakness.

Thi\", \"stomers and the means of satisfying \\nthem are all in one head.\\nFocus\\nThe very skill of insiders can be a weakness. Once someone is good at something, they tend to \\nspend all their time doing that. This kind of focus is very valuable, actually. Much of the skill of \\nexperts is the ability to ignore false trails. But focus has drawbacks: you don't learn from other \\nfields, and when a new approach arrives, you may be the last to notice.\\nFor outsiders this translates into two ways to win. One is to work on a variety of things. Since \\nyou can't derive as much benefit (yet) from a narrow focus, you may as well cast a wider net \\nand derive what benefit you can from similarities between fields. Just as you can compete with \\ndelegation by working on larger vertical slices, you can compete with specialization by working \\non larger horizontal slices — by both writing and illustrating your book, for example.\\nThe second way to compete with focus is to see what focus overlooks. In particular, new th\", \"ialization by working \\non larger horizontal slices — by both writing and illustrating your book, for example.\\nThe second way to compete with focus is to see what focus overlooks. In particular, new things. \\nSo if you're not good at anything yet, consider working on something so new that no one else is \\neither. It won't have any prestige yet, if no one is good at it, but you'll have it all to yourself.\\nThe potential of a new medium is usually underestimated, precisely because no one has yet \\nexplored its possibilities. Before Durer tried making engravings, no one took them very \\nseriously. Engraving was for making little devotional images — basically fifteenth century \\nbaseball cards of saints. Trying to make masterpieces in this medium must have seemed to \\nDurer's contemporaries the way that, say, making masterpieces in comics might seem to the \\naverage person today.\\nIn the computer world we get not new mediums but new platforms: the minicomputer, the \\nmicroprocessor, the web-based app\", \"at, say, making masterpieces in comics might seem to the \\naverage person today.\\nIn the computer world we get not new mediums but new platforms: the minicomputer, the \\nmicroprocessor, the web-based application. At first they're always dismissed as being \\nunsuitable for real work. And yet someone always decides to try anyway, and it turns out you \\ncan do more than anyone expected. So in the future when you hear people say of a new \\nplatform: yeah, it's popular and cheap, but not ready yet for real work, jump on it.\\nAs well as being more comfortable working on established lines, insiders generally have a \\nvested interest in perpetuating them. The professor who made his reputation by discovering \\nsome new idea is not likely to be the one to discover its replacement. This is particularly true \\nwith companies, who have not only skill and pride anchoring them to the status quo, but money \\nas well. The Achilles heel of successful companies is their inability to cannibalize themselves. \\nMany in\", \"with companies, who have not only skill and pride anchoring them to the status quo, but money \\nas well.

Instead of working on \\nthings the eminent have made prestigious, work on things that could steal that prestige.\\nThe really juicy new approaches are not the ones insiders reject as impossible, but those they \\nignore as undignified. For example, after Wozniak designed the Apple II he offered it first to his \\nemployer, HP\\n. They passed. One of the reasons was that, to save money, he'd designed the \\nApple II to use a TV as a monitor, and HP felt they couldn't produce anything so declasse.\\nLess\\nWozniak used a TV as a monitor for the simple reason\", \"reasons was that, to save money, he'd designed the \\nApple II to use a TV as a monitor, and HP felt they couldn't produce anything so declasse.\\nLess\\nWozniak used a TV as a monitor for the simple reason that he couldn't afford a monitor. \\nOutsiders are not merely free but compelled to make things that are cheap and lightweight. And \\nboth are good bets for growth: cheap things spread faster, and lightweight things evolve faster.\\nThe eminent, on the other hand, are almost forced to work on a large scale. Instead of garden \\nsheds they must design huge art museums. One reason they work on big things is that they \\ncan: like our hypothetical novelist, they're flattered by such opportunities. They also know that \\nbig projects will by their sheer bulk impress the audience. A garden shed, however lovely, would \\nbe easy to ignore; a few might even snicker at it.

And finally, there are all those people the eminent have working for \\nthem; they have to choose projects that can keep them all busy.\\nOutsiders are free of all this. They can work on small things, and there's something very \\npleasing about small things. Small things can be perfect; big ones always have something \\nwrong with them. But there's a magic in small things that goes beyond such rational \\nexplanations. All kids know it. Small things have more personality.\\nPlus making them is more fun. You can do what you want; you don't have to satisfy committees. \\nAnd perhaps most important, small things can be done fast. The prospect of seeing the finished \\nproject hangs in the air like the smell of dinner cooking. If you work fast, maybe you could have \\nit done tonight.\\nWorking on small things is also a good way to learn.

And in addition there\\'s the challenge of making \\ndo with less. Every designer\\'s ears perk up at the mention of that game, because it\\'s a game \\nyou can\\'t lose. Like the JV playing the varsity, if you even tie, you win. So paradoxically there are \\ncases where fewer resources yield better results, because the designers\\' pleasure at their own \\ningenuity more than compensates. [5]\\nSo if you\\'re an outsider, take advantage of your ability to make small and inexpensive things. \\nCultivate the pleasure and simplicity of that kind of work; one day you\\'ll miss it.\\nResponsibility\\nWhen you\\'re old and eminent, what will you miss about b', \"bility to make small and inexpensive things. \\nCultivate the pleasure and simplicity of that kind of work; one day you'll miss it.\\nResponsibility\\nWhen you're old and eminent, what will you miss about being young and obscure?

In principle you could avoid it, just as in \\nprinciple you could avoid getting fat as you get old, but few do. I sometimes suspect that \\nresponsibility is a trap and that the most virtuous route would be to shirk it, but regardless it's \\ncertainly constraining.\\nWhen you're an outsider you're constrained too, of course. You're short of money, for example. \\nBut that constrains you in different ways. How does responsibility constrain you? The worst \\nthing is that it allows you not to focus on real work.

But this is \\nactually a good thing. You're at least close enough to work that the smell of it makes you hungry.\\nAs an outsider, you're just one step away from getting things done. A huge step, admittedly, and \\none that most people never seem to make, but only one step. If you can summon up the energy \\nto get started, you can work on projects with an intensity (in both senses) that few insiders can \\nmatch.

Copying is a good way to learn, but copy the right things. When I \\nwas in college I imitated the pompous diction of famous professors. But this wasn't what made \\nthem eminent — it was more a flaw their eminence had allowed them to sink into.

It's good for morale to know people want to see what you're \\nmaking; it draws work out of you.\\nIf I'm right that the defining advantage of insiders is an audience, then we live in exciting times, \\nbecause just in the last ten years the Internet has made audiences a lot more liquid.

That phrase draws in most threads I've mentioned here. Hacking \\nsomething together means deciding what to do as you're doing it, not a subordinate executing \\nthe vision of his boss. It implies the result won't be pretty, because it will be made quickly out of \\ninadequate materials. It may work, but it won't be the sort of thing the eminent would want to \\nput their name on. Something hacked together means something that barely solves the \\nproblem, or maybe doesn't solve the problem at all, but another you discovered en route. But \\nthat's ok, because the main value of that initial version is not the thing itself, but what it leads to. \\nInsiders who daren't walk throug\", 'the problem at all, but another you discovered en route.

I disagree here with Yoda, who said there \\nis no try. There is try. It implies there\\'s no punishment if you fail. You\\'re driven by curiosity \\ninstead of duty. That means the wind of procrastination will be in your favor: instead of avoiding \\nthis work, this will be what you do as a way of avoiding other work. And when you do it, you\\'ll be \\nin a better mood. The more the work depends on imagination, the more that matters, because \\nmost people have more ideas when they\\'re happy.\\nIf I could go back and redo my twenties, that would be one thing I\\'d do more of: just try hacking \\nthings together.

There are a lot of them in Silicon Valley and Boston, and few in \\nChicago or Miami. A country that wants startups will probably also have to reproduce whatever \\nmakes these clusters form.\\nI've claimed that the recipe is a great university near a town smart people like. If you set up \\nthose conditions within the US, startups will form as inevitably as water droplets condense on a \\ncold piece o\", \"aimed that the recipe is a great university near a town smart people like. If you set up \\nthose conditions within the US, startups will form as inevitably as water droplets condense on a \\ncold piece of metal. But when I consider what it would take to reproduce Silicon Valley in \\nanother country, it's clear the US is a particularly humid environment. Startups condense more \\neasily here.\\nIt is by no means a lost cause to try to create a silicon valley in another country. There's room \\nnot merely to equal Silicon Valley, but to surpass it. But if you want to do that, you have to \\nunderstand the advantages startups get from being in America.\\n1. The US Allows Immigration.\\nFor example, I doubt it would be possible to reproduce Silicon Valley in Japan, because one of \\nSilicon Valley's most distinctive features is immigration. Half the people there speak with \\naccents. And the Japanese don't like immigration. When they think about how to make a \\nJapanese silicon valley, I suspect they unconsci\", \"ctive features is immigration. Half the people there speak with \\naccents. And the Japanese don't like immigration. When they think about how to make a \\nJapanese silicon valley, I suspect they unconsciously frame it as how to make one consisting \\nonly of Japanese people. This way of framing the question probably guarantees failure.\\nA silicon valley has to be a mecca for the smart and the ambitious, and you can't have a mecca \\nif you don't let people into it.\\nOf course, it's not saying much that America is more open to immigration than Japan. \\nImmigration policy is one area where a competitor could do better.\\n2. The US Is a Rich Country.\\nI could see India one day producing a rival to Silicon Valley. Obviously they have the right \\npeople: you can tell that by the number of Indians in the current Silicon Valley. The problem with \\nIndia itself is that it's still so poor.\\nIn poor countries, things we take for granted are missing. A friend of mine visiting India sprained \\nher ankle falling do\", \"ent Silicon Valley. The problem with \\nIndia itself is that it's still so poor.\\nIn poor countries, things we take for granted are missing. A friend of mine visiting India sprained \\nher ankle falling down the steps in a railway station. When she turned to see what had \\nhappened, she found the steps were all different heights. In industrialized countries we walk \\ndown steps our whole lives and never think about this, because there's an infrastructure that \\nprevents such a staircase from being built.\\nThe US has never been so poor as some countries are now. There have never been swarms of \\nbeggars in the streets of American cities. So we have no data about what it takes to get from \\nthe swarms-of-beggars stage to the silicon-valley stage. Could you have both at once, or does \\nthere have to be some baseline prosperity before you get a silicon valley?\\nI suspect there is some speed limit to the evolution of an economy. Economies are made out of \\npeople, and attitudes can only change a certain \", \"ome baseline prosperity before you get a silicon valley?\\nI suspect there is some speed limit to the evolution of an economy. Economies are made out of \\npeople, and attitudes can only change a certain amount per generation. [1]\\n3. The US Is Not (Yet) a Police State.\\nAnother country I could see wanting to have a silicon valley is China. But I doubt they could do \\nit yet either. China still seems to be a police state, and although present rulers seem \\nenlightened compared to the last, even enlightened despotism can probably only get you part \\nway toward being a great economic power.\\nIt can get you factories for building things designed elsewhere. Can it get you the designers, \\nthough? Can imagination flourish where people can't criticize the government? Imagination \\nmeans having odd ideas, and it's hard to have odd ideas about technology without also having \\nodd ideas about politics. And in any case, many technical ideas do have political implications. \\nSo if you squash dissent, the back \", \"d it's hard to have odd ideas about technology without also having \\nodd ideas about politics. And in any case, many technical ideas do have political implications. \\nSo if you squash dissent, the back pressure will propagate into technical fields. [2]\\nSingapore would face a similar problem. Singapore seems very aware of the importance of \\nencouraging startups. But while energetic government intervention may be able to make a port \\nrun efficiently, it can't coax startups into existence. A state that bans chewing gum has a long \\nway to go before it could create a San Francisco.\\nDo you need a San Francisco? Might there not be an alternate route to innovation that goes \\nthrough obedience and cooperation instead of individualism? Possibly, but I'd bet not. Most \\nimaginative people seem to share a certain prickly independence, whenever and wherever they \\nlived. You see it in Diogenes telling Alexander to get out of his light and two thousand years \\nlater in Feynman breaking into safes at Los \", 'a certain prickly independence, whenever and wherever they \\nlived. You see it in Diogenes telling Alexander to get out of his light and two thousand years \\nlater in Feynman breaking into safes at Los Alamos. [3] Imaginative people don\\'t want to follow \\nor lead. They\\'re most productive when everyone gets to do what they want.\\nIronically, of all rich countries the US has lost the most civil liberties recently. But I\\'m not too \\nworried yet. I\\'m hoping once the present administration is out, the natural openness of \\nAmerican culture will reassert itself.\\n4. American Universities Are Better.\\nYou need a great university to seed a silicon valley, and so far there are few outside the US. I \\nasked a handful of American computer science professors which universities in Europe were \\nmost admired, and they all basically said \"Cambridge\" followed by a long pause while they tried \\nto think of others. There don\\'t seem to be many universities elsewhere that compare with the \\nbest in America, at least ', ' they all basically said \"Cambridge\" followed by a long pause while they tried \\nto think of others. There don\\'t seem to be many universities elsewhere that compare with the \\nbest in America, at least in technology.\\nIn some countries this is the result of a deliberate policy. The German and Dutch governments, \\nperhaps from fear of elitism, try to ensure that all universities are roughly equal in quality. The \\ndownside is that none are especially good. The best professors are spread out, instead of being \\nconcentrated as they are in the US. This probably makes them less productive, because they \\ndon\\'t have good colleagues to inspire them. It also means no one university will be good \\nenough to act as a mecca, attracting talent from abroad and causing startups to form around it.\\nThe case of Germany is a strange one. The Germans invented the modern university, and up till \\nthe 1930s theirs were the best in the world. Now they have none that stand out. As I was \\nmulling this over, I found m', 'ermany is a strange one. The Germans invented the modern university, and up till \\nthe 1930s theirs were the best in the world. Now they have none that stand out. As I was \\nmulling this over, I found myself thinking: \"I can understand why German universities declined in \\nthe 1930s, after they excluded Jews. But surely they should have bounced back by now.\" Then I \\nrealized: maybe not. There are few Jews left in Germany and most Jews I know would not want \\nto move there. And if you took any great American university and removed the Jews, you\\'d have \\nsome pretty big gaps. So maybe it would be a lost cause trying to create a silicon valley in \\nGermany, because you couldn\\'t establish the level of university you\\'d need as a seed. [4]\\nIt\\'s natural for US universities to compete with one another because so many are private. To \\nreproduce the quality of American universities you probably also have to reproduce this. If \\nuniversities are controlled by the central government, log-rolling will pul', \"ecause so many are private. To \\nreproduce the quality of American universities you probably also have to reproduce this. If \\nuniversities are controlled by the central government, log-rolling will pull them all toward the \\nmean: the new Institute of X will end up at the university in the district of a powerful politician, \\ninstead of where it should be.\\n5. You Can Fire People in America.\\nI think one of the biggest obstacles to creating startups in Europe is the attitude toward \\nemployment. The famously rigid labor laws hurt every company, but startups especially, \\nbecause startups have the least time to spare for bureaucratic hassles.\\nThe difficulty of firing people is a particular problem for startups because they have no \\nredundancy. Every person has to do their job well.\\nBut the problem is more than just that some startup might have a problem firing someone they \\nneeded to. Across industries and countries, there's a strong inverse correlation between \\nperformance and job security. A\", \" is more than just that some startup might have a problem firing someone they \\nneeded to. Across industries and countries, there's a strong inverse correlation between \\nperformance and job security. Actors and directors are fired at the end of each film, so they \\nhave to deliver every time. Junior professors are fired by default after a few years unless the \\nuniversity chooses to grant them tenure. Professional athletes know they'll be pulled if they play \\nbadly for just a couple games. At the other end of the scale (at least in the US) are auto \\nworkers, New York City schoolteachers, and civil servants, who are all nearly impossible to fire. \\nThe trend is so clear that you'd have to be willfully blind not to see it.\\nPerformance isn't everything, you say? Well, are auto workers, schoolteachers, and civil \\nservants happier than actors, professors, and professional athletes?\\nEuropean public opinion will apparently tolerate people being fired in industries where they \\nreally care about pe\", \"hers, and civil \\nservants happier than actors, professors, and professional athletes?\\nEuropean public opinion will apparently tolerate people being fired in industries where they \\nreally care about performance. Unfortunately the only industry they care enough about so far is \\nsoccer. But that is at least a precedent.\\n6. In America Work Is Less Identified with Employment.\\nThe problem in more traditional places like Europe and Japan goes deeper than the \\nemployment laws. More dangerous is the attitude they reflect: that an employee is a kind of \\nservant, whom the employer has a duty to protect. It used to be that way in America too. In \\n1970 you were still supposed to get a job with a big company, for whom ideally you'd work your \\nwhole career. In return the company would take care of you: they'd try not to fire you, cover your \\nmedical expenses, and support you in old age.\\nGradually employment has been shedding such paternalistic overtones and becoming simply \\nan economic exchange. But \", \"hey'd try not to fire you, cover your \\nmedical expenses, and support you in old age.\\nGradually employment has been shedding such paternalistic overtones and becoming simply \\nan economic exchange. But the importance of the new model is not just that it makes it easier \\nfor startups to grow. More important, I think, is that it it makes it easier for people to start \\nstartups.\\nEven in the US most kids graduating from college still think they're supposed to get jobs, as if \\nyou couldn't be productive without being someone's employee. But the less you identify work \\nwith employment, the easier it becomes to start a startup. When you see your career as a \\nseries of different types of work, instead of a lifetime's service to a single employer, there's less \\nrisk in starting your own company, because you're only replacing one segment instead of \\ndiscarding the whole thing.\\nThe old ideas are so powerful that even the most successful startup founders have had to \\nstruggle against them. A year af\", \"use you're only replacing one segment instead of \\ndiscarding the whole thing.\\nThe old ideas are so powerful that even the most successful startup founders have had to \\nstruggle against them. A year after the founding of Apple, Steve Wozniak still hadn't quit HP\\n. He \\nstill planned to work there for life. And when Jobs found someone to give Apple serious venture \\nfunding, on the condition that Woz quit, he initially refused, arguing that he'd designed both the \\nApple I and the Apple II while working at HP\\n, and there was no reason he couldn't continue.\\n7. America Is Not Too Fussy.\\nIf there are any laws regulating businesses, you can assume larval startups will break most of \\nthem, because they don't know what the laws are and don't have time to find out.\\nFor example, many startups in America begin in places where it's not really legal to run a \\nbusiness. Hewlett-Packard, Apple, and Google were all run out of garages.

Hewlett-Packard, Apple, and Google were all run out of garages. Many more startups, \\nincluding ours, were initially run out of apartments. If the laws against such things were actually \\nenforced, most startups wouldn't happen.\\nThat could be a problem in fussier countries. If Hewlett and Packard tried running an electronics \\ncompany out of their garage in Switzerland, the old lady next door would report them to the \\nmunicipal authorities.\\nBut the worst problem in other countries is probably the effort required just to start a company. \\nA friend of mine started a company in Germany in the early 90s, and was shocked to discover, \\namong many other regulations, that you needed $20,000 in capital to incorporate. That's one \\nreason I'm not typing this on an Apfel laptop. Jobs and Wozniak couldn't have come up with that \\nkind of money in a company financed by selling a VW bus and an HP calculator. We couldn't \\nhave started Viawe\", \" I'm not typing this on an Apfel laptop. Jobs and Wozniak couldn't have come up with that \\nkind of money in a company financed by selling a VW bus and an HP calculator. We couldn't \\nhave started Viaweb either. [5]\\nHere's a tip for governments that want to encourage startups: read the stories of existing \\nstartups, and then try to simulate what would have happened in your country. When you hit \\nsomething that would have killed Apple, prune it off.\\nStartups are marginal. They're started by the poor and the timid; they begin in marginal space \\nand spare time; they're started by people who are supposed to be doing something else; and \\nthough businesses, their founders often know nothing about business. Young startups are \\nfragile. A society that trims its margins sharply will kill them all.\\n8. America Has a Large Domestic Market.\\nWhat sustains a startup in the beginning is the prospect of getting their initial product out.

The \\nsuccessful ones therefore make the first version as simple as possible. In the US they usually \\nbegin by making something just for the local market.\\nThis works in America, because the local market is 300 million people. It wouldn't work so well \\nin Sweden. In a small country, a startup has a harder task: they have to sell internationally from \\nthe start.\\nThe EU was designed partly to simulate a single, large domestic market. The problem is that \\nthe inhabitants still speak many different languages. So a software startup in Sweden is still at a \\ndisadvantage relative to one in the US, because they have to deal with internationalization from \\nthe beginning.

This is presumably a \\ntaboo subject, but if present trends continue, French and German will eventually go the way of \\nIrish and Luxembourgish: they'll be spoken in homes and by eccentric nationalists.\\n9. America Has Venture Funding.\\nStartups are easier to start in America because funding is easier to get. There are now a few \\nVC firms outside the US, but startup funding doesn't only come from VC firms. A more \\nimportant source, because it's more personal and comes earlier in the process, is money from \\nindividual angel investors.

This pattern is repeated \\nconstantly in startup hubs. It's this pattern that makes them startup hubs.\\nThe good news is, all you have to do to get the process rolling is get those first few startups \\nsuccessfully launched. If they stick around after they get rich, startup founders will almost \\nautomatically fund and encourage new startups.\\nThe bad news is that the cycle is slow. It probably takes five years, on average, before a startup \\nfounder can make angel investments.

A lot \\nof the money in VC funds comes from their endowments. So another advantage of private \\nuniversities is that a good chunk of the country\\'s wealth is managed by enlightened investors.\\n10. America Has Dynamic Typing for Careers.\\nCompared to other industrialized countries the US is disorganized about routing people into \\ncareers. For example, in America people often don\\'t decide to go to medical school till they\\'ve \\nfinished college. In Europe they generally decide in high school.\\nThe European approach reflects the old idea that each person has a single, definite \\noccupation-- which is not far from the idea that each person has a natural \"station\" in life.

If this \\nwere true, the most efficient plan would be to discover each person\\'s station as early as \\npossible, so they could receive the training appropriate to it.\\nIn the US things are more haphazard. But that turns out to be an advantage as an economy \\ngets more liquid, just as dynamic typing turns out to work better than static for ill-defined \\nproblems. This is particularly true with startups. \"Startup founder\" is not the sort of career a high \\nschool student would choose. If you ask at that age, people will choose conservatively. They\\'ll \\nchoose well-understood occupations like engineer, or doctor, or lawyer.\\nStartups are the kind of thing people don\\'t plan, so you\\'re more likely to get them in a society \\nwhere it\\'s ok to make career decisions on the fly.\\nFor example, in theory the purpose ', 'tor, or lawyer.\\nStartups are the kind of thing people don\\'t plan, so you\\'re more likely to get them in a society \\nwhere it\\'s ok to make career decisions on the fly.\\nFor example, in theory the purpose of a PhD program is to train you to do research. But \\nfortunately in the US this is another rule that isn\\'t very strictly enforced. In the US most people \\nin CS PhD programs are there simply because they wanted to learn more. They haven\\'t \\ndecided what they\\'ll do afterward. So American grad schools spawn a lot of startups, because \\nstudents don\\'t feel they\\'re failing if they don\\'t go into research.\\nThose worried about America\\'s \"competitiveness\" often suggest spending more on public \\nschools. But perhaps America\\'s lousy public schools have a hidden advantage. Because they\\'re \\nso bad, the kids adopt an attitude of waiting for college. I did; I knew I was learning so little that I \\nwasn\\'t even learning what the choices were, let alone which to choose.

Better to make everyone feel like a late bloomer than a failed child prodigy.\\nAttitudes\\nThere's one item conspicuously missing from this list: American attitudes. Americans are said to \\nbe more entrepreneurial, and less afraid of risk. But America has no monopoly on this. Indians \\nand Chinese seem plenty entrepreneurial, perhaps more than Americans.\\nSome say Europeans are less energetic, but I don't believe it. I think the problem with Europe is \\nnot that they lack balls, but that they lack examples.\\nEven in the US, the most successful startup founders are oft\", \"eans are less energetic, but I don't believe it. I think the problem with Europe is \\nnot that they lack balls, but that they lack examples.\\nEven in the US, the most successful startup founders are often technical people who are quite \\ntimid, initially, about the idea of starting their own company. Few are the sort of backslapping \\nextroverts one thinks of as typically American. They can usually only summon up the activation \\nenergy to start a startup when they meet people who've done it and realize they could too.\\nI think what holds back European hackers is simply that they don't meet so many people who've \\ndone it. You see that variation even within the US. Stanford students are more entrepreneurial \\nthan Yale students, but not because of some difference in their characters; the Yale students \\njust have fewer examples.\\nI admit there seem to be different attitudes toward ambition in Europe and the US. In the US it's \\nok to be overtly ambitious, and in most of Europe it's not. But this \", 'ents \\njust have fewer examples.\\nI admit there seem to be different attitudes toward ambition in Europe and the US. In the US it\\'s \\nok to be overtly ambitious, and in most of Europe it\\'s not. But this can\\'t be an intrinsically \\nEuropean quality; previous generations of Europeans were as ambitious as Americans. What \\nhappened? My hypothesis is that ambition was discredited by the terrible things ambitious \\npeople did in the first half of the twentieth century. Now swagger is out. (Even now the image of \\na very ambitious German presses a button or two, doesn\\'t it?)\\nIt would be surprising if European attitudes weren\\'t affected by the disasters of the twentieth \\ncentury. It takes a while to be optimistic after events like that. But ambition is human nature. \\nGradually it will re-emerge. [6]\\nHow To Do Better\\nI don\\'t mean to suggest by this list that America is the perfect place for startups. It\\'s the best \\nplace so far, but the sample size is small, and \"so far\" is not very long.

How could you make something users would like better? The \\nusers in this case are those critical few thousand people you\\'d like to move to your silicon valley.\\nTo start with, Silicon Valley is too far from San Francisco. Palo Alto, the original ground zero, is \\nabout thirty miles away, and the present center more like forty. So people who come to work in \\nSilicon Valley face an unpleasant choice: either live in the boring sprawl of the valley proper, or \\nlive in San Francisco and endure an hour commute each way.\\nThe best thing would be if the silicon valley were not merely closer to the interesting city, but \\nintere', \"ng sprawl of the valley proper, or \\nlive in San Francisco and endure an hour commute each way.\\nThe best thing would be if the silicon valley were not merely closer to the interesting city, but \\ninteresting itself.

There is a \\ntrain running the length of it, and by American standards it's not bad. Which is to say that to \\nJapanese or Europeans it would seem like something out of the third world.\\nThe kind of people you want to attract to your silicon valley like to get around by train, bicycle, \\nand on foot.

It will be a while \\nbefore any American city can bring itself to do that.\\nCapital Gains\\nThere are also a couple things you could do to beat America at the national level. One would be \\nto have lower capital gains taxes. It doesn\\'t seem critical to have the lowest income taxes, \\nbecause to take advantage of those, people have to move. [7] But if capital gains rates vary, you \\nmove assets, not yourself, so changes are reflected at market speeds. The lower the rate, the \\ncheaper it is to buy stock in growing companies as opposed to real estate, or bonds, or stocks \\nbought for the dividends they pay.\\nSo if you want to encourage startups you should have a low rate on capital gains.

Politicians are \\ncaught between a rock and a hard place here, however: make the capital gains rate low and be \\naccused of creating \"tax breaks for the rich,\" or make it high and starve growing companies of \\ninvestment capital. As Galbraith said, politics is a matter of choosing between the unpalatable \\nand the disastrous. A lot of governments experimented with the disastrous in the twentieth \\ncentury; now the trend seems to be toward the merely unpalatable.\\nOddly enough, the leaders now are European countries like Belgium, which has a capital gains \\ntax rate of zero.\\nImmigration\\nThe other place you could beat the US would be with smarter immigration policy. There are \\nhuge gains to be made here.

What does it take to make a silicon valley even here?\\nWhat it takes is the right people. If you could get the right ten thousand people to move from \\nSilicon Valley to Buffalo, Buffalo would become Silicon Valley. [1]\\nThat's a striking departure from the past.

All great cities were located on waterways, because cities made money by trade, and \\nwater was the only economical way to ship.\\nNow you could make a great city anywhere, if you could get the right people to move there. So \\nthe question of how to make a silicon valley becomes: who are the right people, and how do \\nyou get them to move?\\nTwo Types\\nI think you only need two kinds of people to create a technology hub: rich people and nerds. \\nThey're the limiting reagents in the reaction that produces startups, because they're the only \\nones present when startups get started. Everyone else will move.\\nObservation bears this out: within the US, towns have become startup hubs if and only if they \\nhave both rich people and nerds. Few startups happen in Miami, for example, because although \\nit's full of rich people, it has few nerds. It's not the kind of place nerds like.\\nWhereas Pittsburgh has the opposite \", \"h people and nerds.

The top US \\nComputer Science departments are said to be MIT, Stanford, Berkeley, and Carnegie-Mellon. \\nMIT yielded Route 128. Stanford and Berkeley yielded Silicon Valley. But Carnegie-Mellon? The \\nrecord skips at that point. Lower down the list, the University of Washington yielded a high-tech \\ncommunity in Seattle, and the University of Texas at Austin yielded one in Austin. But what \\nhappened in Pittsburgh? And in Ithaca, home of Cornell, which is also high on the list?\\nI grew up in Pittsburgh and went to college at Cornell, so I can answer for both. The weather is \\nterrible, particularly in winter, and there's no interesting old city to make up for it, as there is in \\nBoston. Rich people don't want to live in Pittsburgh or Ithaca. So while \", \"both. The weather is \\nterrible, particularly in winter, and there's no interesting old city to make up for it, as there is in \\nBoston. Rich people don't want to live in Pittsburgh or Ithaca. So while there are plenty of \\nhackers who could start startups, there's no one to invest in them.\\nNot Bureaucrats\\nDo you really need the rich people? Wouldn't it work to have the government invest in the \\nnerds? No, it would not. Startup investors are a distinct type of rich people. They tend to have a \\nlot of experience themselves in the technology business. This (a) helps them pick the right \\nstartups, and (b) means they can supply advice and connections as well as money. And the fact \\nthat they have a personal stake in the outcome makes them really pay attention.\\nBureaucrats by their nature are the exact opposite sort of people from startup investors. The \\nidea of them making startup investments is comic. It would be like mathematicians running \\nVogue-- or perhaps more accurately, Vogue editors \", 'exact opposite sort of people from startup investors. The \\nidea of them making startup investments is comic. It would be like mathematicians running \\nVogue-- or perhaps more accurately, Vogue editors running a math journal. [2]\\nThough indeed, most things bureaucrats do, they do badly. We just don\\'t notice usually, \\nbecause they only have to compete against other bureaucrats. But as startup investors they\\'d \\nhave to compete against pros with a great deal more experience and motivation.\\nEven corporations that have in-house VC groups generally forbid them to make their own \\ninvestment decisions. Most are only allowed to invest in deals where some reputable private VC \\nfirm is willing to act as lead investor.\\nNot Buildings\\nIf you go to see Silicon Valley, what you\\'ll see are buildings.

An article \\nabout Sophia Antipolis bragged that companies there included Cisco, Compaq, IBM, NCR, and \\nNortel. Don\\'t the French realize these aren\\'t startups?\\nBuilding office buildings for technology companies won\\'t get you a silicon valley, because the \\nkey stage in the life of a startup happens before they want that kind of space. The key stage is \\nwhen they\\'re three guys operating out of an apartment. Wherever the startup is when it gets \\nfunded, it will stay. The defining quality of Silicon Valley is not that Intel or Apple or Google have \\noffices there, but that they were started there.\\nSo if you want to reproduce Silicon Valley, what you need to reproduce is those two or three \\nfounders sitting around a kitchen table deciding to start a company.

If you could attract a critical mass of nerds \\nand investors to live somewhere, you could reproduce Silicon Valley. And both groups are highly \\nmobile. They'll go where life is good. So what makes a place good to them?\\nWhat nerds like is other nerds. Smart people will go wherever other smart people are. And in \\nparticular, to great universities. In theory there could be other ways to attract them, but so far \\nuniversities seem to be indispensable. Within the US, there are no technology hubs without first-\\nrate universities-- or at least, first-rate computer science departments.\\nSo if you want to make a silicon valley, you not only need a university, but one of the top handful \\nin the world.

It has to be good enough to act as a magnet, drawing the best people from \\nthousands of miles away. And that means it has to stand up to existing magnets like MIT and \\nStanford.\\nThis sounds hard. Actually it might be easy. My professor friends, when they're deciding where \\nthey'd like to work, consider one thing above all: the quality of the other faculty. What attracts \\nprofessors is good colleagues. So if you managed to recruit, en masse, a significant number of \\nthe best young researchers, you could create a first-rate university from nothing overnight. And \\nyou could do that for surprisingly little. If you paid 200 people hiring bonuses of $3 million \\napiece, you could put together a faculty that would bear comparison with any in the world.

And \\nfrom that point the chain reaction would be self-sustaining. So whatever it costs to establish a \\nmediocre university, for an additional half billion or so you could have a great one. [3]\\nPersonality\\nHowever, merely creating a new university would not be enough to start a silicon valley. The \\nuniversity is just the seed. It has to be planted in the right soil, or it won't germinate. Plant it in \\nthe wrong place, and you just create Carnegie-Mellon.\\nTo spawn startups, your university has to be in a town that has attractions other than the \\nuniversity. It has to be a place where investors want to live, and students want to stay after they \\ngraduate.\\nThe two like much the same things, because most startup investors are nerds themselves.

That is certainly true; in fact it was the basis of Amsterdam\\'s prosperity 400 years ago.\\nA lot of nerd tastes they share with the creative class in general.

I think it\\'s the feeling that each building is the work of a distinct \\ngroup of people. A town with personality is one that doesn\\'t feel mass-produced. So if you want \\nto make a startup hub-- or any town to attract the \"creative class\"-- you probably have to ban \\nlarge development projects. When a large tract has been developed by a single organization, \\nyou can always tell. [4]\\nMost towns with personality are old, but they don\\'t have to be. Old towns have two advantages: \\nthey\\'re denser, because they were laid out before cars, and they\\'re more varied, because they \\nwere built one building at a time. You could have both now.

You could have both now. Just have building codes that ensure \\ndensity, and ban large scale developments.\\nA corollary is that you have to keep out the biggest developer of all: the government. A \\ngovernment that asks \"How can we build a silicon valley?\" has probably ensured failure by the \\nway they framed the question. You don\\'t build a silicon valley; you let one grow.\\nNerds\\nIf you want to attract nerds, you need more than a town with personality. You need a town with \\nthe right personality. Nerds are a distinct subset of the creative class, with different tastes from \\nthe rest. You can see this most clearly in New York, which attracts a lot of creative people, but \\nfew nerds. [5]\\nWhat nerds like is the kind of town where people walk around smiling. This excludes LA, where \\nno one walks at all, and also New York, where people walk, but not smiling.

They just looked like \\nthey were compared to the facial expressions she was used to.\\nIf you\\'ve lived in New York, you know where these facial expressions come from. It\\'s the kind of \\nplace where your mind may be excited, but your body knows it\\'s having a bad time. People don\\'t \\nso much enjoy living there as endure it for the sake of the excitement. And if you like certain \\nkinds of excitement, New York is incomparable. It\\'s a hub of glamour, a magnet for all the \\nshorter half-life isotopes of style and fame.\\nNerds don\\'t care about glamour, so to them the appeal of New York is a mystery.

It would be a waste of time to try to reverse the fortunes of a declining industrial \\ntown like Detroit or Philadelphia by trying to encourage startups. Those places have too much \\nmomentum in the wrong direction. You're better off starting with a blank slate in the form of a \\nsmall town. Or better still, if there's a town young people already flock to, that one.\\nThe Bay Area was a magnet for the young and optimistic for decades before it was associated \\nwith technology.

If you wanted to start a \\nnew fad-- a new way to focus one\\'s \"energy,\" for example, or a new category of things not to \\neat-- the Bay Area would be the place to do it. But a place that tolerates oddness in the search \\nfor the new is exactly what you want in a startup hub, because economically that\\'s what \\nstartups are. Most good startup ideas seem a little crazy; if they were obviously good ideas, \\nsomeone would have done them already.\\n(How many people are going to want computers in their houses?

It\\'s \\nbecause liberal cities tolerate odd ideas, and smart people by definition have odd ideas.\\nConversely, a town that gets praised for being \"solid\" or representing \"traditional values\" may be \\na fine place to live, but it\\'s never going to succeed as a startup hub. The 2004 presidential \\nelection, though a disaster in other respects, conveniently supplied us with a county-by-county \\nmap of such places. [6]\\nTo attract the young, a town must have an intact center. In most American cities the center has \\nbeen abandoned, and the growth, if any, is in the suburbs. Most American cities have been \\nturned inside out. But none of the startup hubs has: not San Francisco, or Boston, or Seattle. \\nThey all have intact centers.

That was all it took to make the \\noriginal Silicon Valley. Silicon Valley traces its origins to William Shockley, one of the inventors \\nof the transistor.

Shockley was a difficult man, and in 1957 his top people-- \"the traitorous \\neight\"-- left to start a new company, Fairchild Semiconductor. Among them were Gordon Moore \\nand Robert Noyce, who went on to found Intel, and Eugene Kleiner, who founded the VC firm \\nKleiner Perkins. Forty-two years later, Kleiner Perkins funded Google, and the partner \\nresponsible for the deal was John Doerr, who came to Silicon Valley in 1974 to work for Intel.\\nSo although a lot of the newest companies in Silicon Valley don\\'t make anything out of silicon, \\nthere a', \"\\nresponsible for the deal was John Doerr, who came to Silicon Valley in 1974 to work for Intel.\\nSo although a lot of the newest companies in Silicon Valley don't make anything out of silicon, \\nthere always seem to be multiple links back to Shockley. There's a lesson here: startups beget \\nstartups. People who work for startups start their own. People who get rich from startups fund \\nnew ones. I suspect this kind of organic growth is the only way to produce a startup hub, \\nbecause it's the only way to grow the expertise you need.\\nThat has two important implications. The first is that you need time to grow a silicon valley. The \\nuniversity you could create in a couple years, but the startup community around it has to grow \\norganically. The cycle time is limited by the time it takes a company to succeed, which probably \\naverages about five years.\\nThe other implication of the organic growth hypothesis is that you can't be somewhat of a \\nstartup hub. You either have a self-sustaining chain r\", \"to succeed, which probably \\naverages about five years.\\nThe other implication of the organic growth hypothesis is that you can't be somewhat of a \\nstartup hub. You either have a self-sustaining chain reaction, or not. Observation confirms this \\ntoo: cities either have a startup scene, or they don't. There is no middle ground. Chicago has \\nthe third largest metropolitan area in America. As source of startups it's negligible compared to \\nSeattle, number 15.\\nThe good news is that the initial seed can be quite small. Shockley Semiconductor, though itself \\nnot very successful, was big enough. It brought a critical mass of experts in an important new \\ntechnology together in a place they liked enough to stay.\\nCompeting\\nOf course, a would-be silicon valley faces an obstacle the original one didn't: it has to compete \\nwith Silicon Valley.

In fact, Shockley Semiconductor and Fairchild \\nSemiconductor were not startups at all in our sense. They were subsidiaries-- of Beckman \\nInstruments and Fairchild Camera and Instrument respectively. Those companies were \\napparently willing to establish subsidiaries wherever the experts wanted to live.\\nVenture investors, however, prefer to fund startups within an hour's drive. For one, they're more \\nlikely to notice startups nearby. But when they do notice startups in other towns they prefer \\nthem to move.

And although the first may be \\nweakening because it\\'s now so cheap to start some startups, the second seems as strong as \\never. Three of the most admired \"Web 2.0\" companies were started outside the usual startup \\nhubs, but two of them have already been reeled in through acquisitions.\\nSuch centralizing forces make it harder for new silicon valleys to get started. But by no means \\nimpossible. Ultimately power rests with the founders. A startup with the best people will beat \\none with funding from famous VCs, and a startup that was sufficiently successful would never \\nhave to move.

Users hate bugs, but they don\\'t seem to mind a minimal version 1, \\nif there\\'s more coming soon.\\nThere are several reasons it pays to get version 1 done fast. One is that this is simply the right \\nway to write software, whether for a startup or not. I\\'ve been repeating that since 1993, and I \\nhaven\\'t seen much since to contradict it.

If anything major is broken-- if the idea's no good, for \\nexample, or the founders hate one another-- the stress of getting that first version out will \\nexpose it. And if you have such problems you want to find them early.\\nPerhaps the most important reason to release early, though, is that it makes you work harder. \\nWhen you're working on something that isn't released, problems are intriguing. In something \\nthat's out there, problems are alarming. There is a lot more urgency once you release. And I \\nthink that's precisely why people put it off.

And I \\nthink that\\'s precisely why people put it off. They know they\\'ll have to work a lot harder once they \\ndo. [2]\\n2. Keep Pumping Out Features.\\nOf course, \"release early\" has a second component, without which it would be bad advice. If \\nyou\\'re going to start with something that doesn\\'t do much, you better improve it fast.\\nWhat I find myself repeating is \"pump out features.\" And this rule isn\\'t just for the initial stages. \\nThis is something all startups should do for as long as they want to be considered startups.\\nI don\\'t mean, of course, that you should make your application ever more complex. By \"feature\" \\nI mean one unit of hacking-- one quantum of making users\\' lives better.\\nAs with exercise, improvements beget improvements. If you run every day, you\\'ll probably feel \\nlike running tomorrow. But if you skip running for a couple weeks, it will be an effort to drag \\nyourself out. So it is wi', \" improvements beget improvements. If you run every day, you'll probably feel \\nlike running tomorrow. But if you skip running for a couple weeks, it will be an effort to drag \\nyourself out. So it is with hacking: the more ideas you implement, the more ideas you'll have. \\nYou should make your system better at least in some small way every day or two.\\nThis is not just a good way to get development done; it is also a form of marketing. Users love a \\nsite that's constantly improving. In fact, users expect a site to improve. Imagine if you visited a \\nsite that seemed very good, and then returned two months later and not one thing had \\nchanged. Wouldn't it start to seem lame? [3]\\nThey'll like you even better when you improve in response to their comments, because \\ncustomers are used to companies ignoring them. If you're the rare exception-- a company that \\nactually listens-- you'll generate fanatical loyalty. You won't need to advertise, because your \\nusers will do it for you.\\nThis seems obvi\", \"ignoring them. If you're the rare exception-- a company that \\nactually listens-- you'll generate fanatical loyalty. You won't need to advertise, because your \\nusers will do it for you.\\nThis seems obvious too, so why do I have to keep repeating it? I think the problem here is that \\npeople get used to how things are. Once a product gets past the stage where it has glaring \\nflaws, you start to get used to it, and gradually whatever features it happens to have become its \\nidentity. For example, I doubt many people at Yahoo (or Google for that matter) realized how \\nmuch better web mail could be till Paul Buchheit showed them.\\nI think the solution is to assume that anything you've made is far short of what it could be. Force \\nyourself, as a sort of intellectual exercise, to keep thinking of improvements. Ok, sure, what you \\nhave is perfect. But if you had to change something, what would it be?\\nIf your product seems finished, there are two possible explanations: (a) it is finished, or (b) you\", \"ovements.

But if you had to change something, what would it be?\\nIf your product seems finished, there are two possible explanations: (a) it is finished, or (b) you \\nlack imagination. Experience suggests (b) is a thousand times more likely.\\n3. Make Users Happy.\\nImproving constantly is an instance of a more general rule: make users happy. One thing all \\nstartups have in common is that they can't force anyone to do anything. They can't force anyone \\nto use their software, and they can't force anyone to do deals with them. A startup has to sing \\nfor its supper. That's why the successful ones make great things. They have to, or die.\\nWhen you're running a startup you feel like a little bit of debris blown about by powerful winds. \\nThe most powerful wind is users. They can either catch you and loft you up into the sky, as they \\ndid with Google, or leave you flat on the pavement, as they do with most startups. Users are a \\nfickle wind, but more powerful tha\", 'ers. They can either catch you and loft you up into the sky, as they \\ndid with Google, or leave you flat on the pavement, as they do with most startups. Users are a \\nfickle wind, but more powerful than any other. If they take you up, no competitor can keep you \\ndown.\\nAs a little piece of debris, the rational thing for you to do is not to lie flat, but to curl yourself into \\na shape the wind will catch.\\nI like the wind metaphor because it reminds you how impersonal the stream of traffic is. The \\nvast majority of people who visit your site will be casual visitors. It\\'s them you have to design \\nyour site for. The people who really care will find what they want by themselves.\\nThe median visitor will arrive with their finger poised on the Back button. Think about your own \\nexperience: most links you follow lead to something lame. Anyone who has used the web for \\nmore than a couple weeks has been trained to click on Back after following a link. So your site \\nhas to say \"Wait! Don\\'t click on ', 's you follow lead to something lame. Anyone who has used the web for \\nmore than a couple weeks has been trained to click on Back after following a link. So your site \\nhas to say \"Wait! Don\\'t click on Back. This site isn\\'t lame. Look at this, for example.\"\\nThere are two things you have to do to make people pause. The most important is to explain, as \\nconcisely as possible, what the hell your site is about. How often have you visited a site that \\nseemed to assume you already knew what they did? For example, the corporate site that says \\nthe company makes enterprise content management solutions for business that enable \\norganizations to unify people, content and processes to minimize business risk, accelerate time-\\nto-value and sustain lower total cost of ownership. An established company may get away with \\nsuch an opaque description, but no startup can. A startup should be able to explain in one or \\ntwo sentences exactly what it does. [4] And not just to users. You need this for everyone', ' get away with \\nsuch an opaque description, but no startup can. A startup should be able to explain in one or \\ntwo sentences exactly what it does. [4] And not just to users. You need this for everyone: \\ninvestors, acquirers, partners, reporters, potential employees, and even current employees. You \\nprobably shouldn\\'t even start a company to do something that can\\'t be described compellingly \\nin one or two sentences.\\nThe other thing I repeat is to give people everything you\\'ve got, right away. If you have \\nsomething impressive, try to put it on the front page, because that\\'s the only one most visitors \\nwill see. Though indeed there\\'s a paradox here: the more you push the good stuff toward the \\nfront, the more likely visitors are to explore further. [5]\\nIn the best case these two suggestions get combined: you tell visitors what your site is about by \\nshowing them. One of the standard pieces of advice in fiction writing is \"show, don\\'t tell.\" Don\\'t \\nsay that a character\\'s angry; have him g', 'get combined: you tell visitors what your site is about by \\nshowing them. One of the standard pieces of advice in fiction writing is \"show, don\\'t tell.\" Don\\'t \\nsay that a character\\'s angry; have him grind his teeth, or break his pencil in half. Nothing will \\nexplain what your site does so well as using it.\\nThe industry term here is \"conversion.\" The job of your site is to convert casual visitors into \\nusers-- whatever your definition of a user is. You can measure this in your growth rate. Either \\nyour site is catching on, or it isn\\'t, and you must know which. If you have decent growth, you\\'ll \\nwin in the end, no matter how obscure you are now. And if you don\\'t, you need to fix something.\\n4. Fear the Right Things.\\nAnother thing I find myself saying a lot is \"don\\'t worry.\" Actually, it\\'s more often \"don\\'t worry \\nabout this; worry about that instead.\" Startups are right to be paranoid, but they sometimes fear \\nthe wrong things.\\nMost visible disasters are not so alarming as they seem. Disa', 'e often \"don\\'t worry \\nabout this; worry about that instead.\" Startups are right to be paranoid, but they sometimes fear \\nthe wrong things.\\nMost visible disasters are not so alarming as they seem. Disasters are normal in a startup: a \\nfounder quits, you discover a patent that covers what you\\'re doing, your servers keep crashing, \\nyou run into an insoluble technical problem, you have to change your name, a deal falls \\nthrough-- these are all par for the course. They won\\'t kill you unless you let them.\\nNor will most competitors. A lot of startups worry \"what if Google builds something like us?\" \\nActually big companies are not the ones you have to worry about-- not even Google. The \\npeople at Google are smart, but no smarter than you; they\\'re not as motivated, because Google \\nis not going to go out of business if this one product fails; and even at Google they have a lot of \\nbureaucracy to slow them down.\\nWhat you should fear, as a startup, is not the established players, but other startup', \"o out of business if this one product fails; and even at Google they have a lot of \\nbureaucracy to slow them down.\\nWhat you should fear, as a startup, is not the established players, but other startups you don't \\nknow exist yet. They're way more dangerous than Google because, like you, they're cornered \\nanimals.\\nLooking just at existing competitors can give you a false sense of security. You should compete \\nagainst what someone else could be doing, not just what you can see people doing. A corollary \\nis that you shouldn't relax just because you have no visible competitors yet. No matter what \\nyour idea, there's someone else out there working on the same thing.\\nThat's the downside of it being easier to start a startup: more people are doing it. But I disagree \\nwith Caterina Fake when she says that makes this a bad time to start a startup. More people \\nare starting startups, but not as many more as could. Most college graduates still think they \\nhave to get a job. The average person can'\", \"ys that makes this a bad time to start a startup. More people \\nare starting startups, but not as many more as could. Most college graduates still think they \\nhave to get a job. The average person can't ignore something that's been beaten into their head \\nsince they were three just because serving web pages recently got a lot cheaper.\\nAnd in any case, competitors are not the biggest threat. Way more startups hose themselves \\nthan get crushed by competitors. There are a lot of ways to do it, but the three main ones are \\ninternal disputes, inertia, and ignoring users. Each is, by itself, enough to kill you. But if I had to \\npick the worst, it would be ignoring users. If you want a recipe for a startup that's going to die, \\nhere it is: a couple of founders who have some great idea they know everyone is going to love, \\nand that's what they're going to build, no matter what.\\nAlmost everyone's initial plan is broken. If companies stuck to their initial plans, Microsoft would \\nbe selling progr\", \"eryone is going to love, \\nand that's what they're going to build, no matter what.\\nAlmost everyone's initial plan is broken. If companies stuck to their initial plans, Microsoft would \\nbe selling programming languages, and Apple would be selling printed circuit boards. In both \\ncases their customers told them what their business should be-- and they were smart enough \\nto listen.\\nAs Richard Feynman said, the imagination of nature is greater than the imagination of man. \\nYou'll find more interesting things by looking at the world than you could ever produce just by \\nthinking. This principle is very powerful. It's why the best abstract painting still falls short of \\nLeonardo, for example. And it applies to startups too. No idea for a product could ever be so \\nclever as the ones you can discover by smashing a beam of prototypes into a beam of users.\\n5.

Commitment Is a Self-Fulfilling Prophecy.\\nI now have enough experience with startups to be able to say what the most important quality is \\nin a startup founder, and it's not what you might think. The most important quality in a startup \\nfounder is determination. Not intelligence-- determination.\\nThis is a little depressing. I'd like to believe Viaweb succeeded because we were smart, not \\nmerely determined. A lot of people in the startup world want to believe that. Not just founders, \\nbut investors too. They like the idea of inhabiting a world ruled by intelligence. And you can tell \\nthey really believe this, because it affects their investment decisions.\\nTime after time VCs invest in startups founded by eminent professors.

But lose even a little bit in \\nthe commitment department, and that will kill you very rapidly.\\nRunning a startup is like walking on your hands: it's possible, but it requires extraordinary effort. \\nIf an ordinary employee were asked to do the things a startup founder has to, he'd be very \\nindignant.

That's the part that really demands determination. In a startup, \\nthere's always some disaster happening. So if you're the least bit inclined to find an excuse to \\nquit, there's always one right there.\\nBut if you lack commitment, chances are it will have been hurting you long before you actually \\nquit.

If you lack commitment, you\\'ll just find \\nthat for some mysterious reason good things happen to your competitors but not to you. If you \\nlack commitment, it will seem to you that you\\'re unlucky.\\nWhereas if you\\'re determined to stick around, people will pay attention to you, because odds \\nare they\\'ll have to deal with you later. You\\'re a local, not just a tourist, so everyone has to come \\nto terms with you.\\nAt Y Combinator we sometimes mistakenly fund teams who have the attitude that they\\'re going \\nto give this startup thing a shot for three months, and if something great happens, they\\'ll stick \\nwith it-- \"something great\" meaning either that someone wants to buy them or invest millions of \\ndollars in them.

Ditto for investors. What really motivates \\ninvestors, even big VCs, is not the hope of good returns, but the fear of missing out. [6] So if \\nyou make it clear you\\'re going to succeed no matter what, and the only reason you need them \\nis to make it happen a little faster, you\\'re much more likely to get money.\\nYou can\\'t fake this.

The one thing he'll never do is stand still. [7]\\n6. There Is Always Room.\\nI was talking recently to a startup founder about whether it might be good to add a social \\ncomponent to their software. He said he didn't think so, because the whole social thing was \\ntapped out. Really?

At every point in history, even the darkest bits of the dark \\nages, people were discovering things that made everyone say \"why didn\\'t anyone think of that \\nbefore?\" We know this continued to be true up till 2004, when the Facebook was founded-- \\nthough strictly speaking someone else did think of that.\\nThe reason we don\\'t see the opportunities all around us is that we adjust to however things are, \\nand assume that\\'s how things have to be. For example, it would seem crazy to most people to \\ntry to make a better search engine than Google. Surely that field, at least, is tapped out.

Sometimes you hear \\npeople saying \"All these guys starting startups now are going to be disappointed. How many \\nlittle startups are Google and Yahoo going to buy, after all?\" That sounds cleverly skeptical, but I \\ncan prove it\\'s mistaken. No one proposes that there\\'s some limit to the number of people who \\ncan be employed in an economy consisting of big, slow-moving companies with a couple \\nthousand people each.

And I don't think there's any limit on that, \\nexcept cosmological ones.\\nSo for all practical purposes, there is no limit to the number of startups. Startups make wealth, \\nwhich means they make things people want, and if there's a limit on the number of things \\npeople want, we are nowhere near it. I still don't even have a flying car.\\n7.

An optimism shield has to be pierced too. I think the place to draw the \\nline is between what you expect of yourself, and what you expect of other people. It's ok to be \\noptimistic about what you can do, but assume the worst about machines and other people.\\nThis is particularly necessary in a startup, because you tend to be pushing the limits of \\nwhatever you're doing.

Then if things work out you can be pleasantly \\nsurprised.\\nThe reason I warn startups not to get their hopes up is not to save them from being \\ndisappointed when things fall through. It's for a more practical reason: to prevent them from \\nleaning their company against something that's going to fall over, taking them with it.\\nFor example, if someone says they want to invest in you, there's a natural tendency to stop \\nlooking for other investors. That's why peop\", \"inst something that's going to fall over, taking them with it.\\nFor example, if someone says they want to invest in you, there's a natural tendency to stop \\nlooking for other investors. That's why people proposing deals seem so positive: they want you \\nto stop looking. And you want to stop too, because doing deals is a pain. Raising money, in \\nparticular, is a huge time sink. So you have to consciously force yourself to keep looking.\\nEven if you ultimately do the first deal, it will be to your advantage to have kept looking, \\nbecause you'll get better terms. Deals are dynamic; unless you're negotiating with someone \\nunusually honest, there's not a single point where you shake hands and the deal's done. There \\nare usually a lot of subsidiary questions to be cleared up after the handshake, and if the other \\nside senses weakness-- if they sense you need this deal-- they will be very tempted to screw \\nyou in the details.\\nVCs and corp dev guys are professional negotiators.

It is. When I talk to the \\nfounders of the companies we've funded, they all say the same thing: I knew it would be hard, \\nbut I didn't realize it would be this hard.\\nSo why do it? It would be worth enduring a lot of pain and stress to do something grand or \\nheroic, but just to make money? Is making money really that important?\\nNo, not really. It seems ridiculous to me when people take business too seriously. I regard \\nmaking money as a boring errand to be got out of the way as soon as possible.

So difficult that there\\'s probably \\nroom to discard more. Richard Dawkins made another step in that direction only in the last \\nseveral decades, with the idea of the selfish gene. No, it turns out, we\\'re not even the \\nprotagonists: we\\'re just the latest model vehicle our genes have constructed to travel around in. \\nAnd having kids is our genes heading for the lifeboats.

This was all the more \\nsurprising because I\\'d only applied for three. The patents aren\\'t mine, of course. They were \\nassigned to Viaweb, and became Yahoo\\'s when they bought us. But the news set me thinking \\nabout the question of software patents generally.\\nPatents are a hard problem.

I\\'ve had to advise most of the startups we\\'ve funded about them, \\nand despite years of experience I\\'m still not always sure I\\'m giving the right advice.\\nOne thing I do feel pretty certain of is that if you\\'re against software patents, you\\'re against \\npatents in general. Gradually our machines consist more and more of software. Things that \\nused to be done with levers and cams and gears are now done with loops and trees and \\nclosures. There\\'s nothing special about physical embodiments of control systems that should \\nmake them patentable, and the software equivalent not.\\nUnfortunately, patent law is inconsistent on this point. Patent law in most countries says that \\nalgorithms aren\\'t patentable. This rule is left over from a time when \"algorithm\" meant \\nsomething like the Sieve of Eratosthenes. In 1800, people could not see as readily as we can \\nthat a great many patents on mechan', 'patentable. This rule is left over from a time when \"algorithm\" meant \\nsomething like the Sieve of Eratosthenes. In 1800, people could not see as readily as we can \\nthat a great many patents on mechanical objects were really patents on the algorithms they \\nembodied.\\nPatent lawyers still have to pretend that\\'s what they\\'re doing when they patent algorithms. You \\nmust not use the word \"algorithm\" in the title of a patent application, just as you must not use \\nthe word \"essays\" in the title of a book. If you want to patent an algorithm, you have to frame it \\nas a computer system executing that algorithm. Then it\\'s mechanical; phew. The default \\neuphemism for algorithm is \"system and method.\" Try a patent search for that phrase and see \\nhow many results you get.\\nSince software patents are no different from hardware patents, people who say \"software \\npatents are evil\" are saying simply \"patents are evil.\" So why do so many people complain \\nabout software patents specifically?\\nI think the pr', 'ifferent from hardware patents, people who say \"software \\npatents are evil\" are saying simply \"patents are evil.\" So why do so many people complain \\nabout software patents specifically?\\nI think the problem is more with the patent office than the concept of software patents. \\nWhenever software meets government, bad things happen, because software changes fast and \\ngovernment changes slow. The patent office has been overwhelmed by both the volume and \\nthe novelty of applications for software patents, and as a result they\\'ve made a lot of mistakes.\\nThe most common is to grant patents that shouldn\\'t be granted. To be patentable, an invention \\nhas to be more than new. It also has to be non-obvious. And this, especially, is where the \\nUSPTO has been dropping the ball. Slashdot has an icon that expresses the problem vividly: a \\nknife and fork with the words \"patent pending\" superimposed.\\nThe scary thing is, this is the only icon they have for patent stories. Slashdot readers now take it \\nfor ', 'xpresses the problem vividly: a \\nknife and fork with the words \"patent pending\" superimposed.\\nThe scary thing is, this is the only icon they have for patent stories. Slashdot readers now take it \\nfor granted that a story about a patent will be about a bogus patent. That\\'s how bad the problem \\nhas become.\\nThe problem with Amazon\\'s notorious one-click patent, for example, is not that it\\'s a software \\npatent, but that it\\'s obvious. Any online store that kept people\\'s shipping addresses would have \\nimplemented this. The reason Amazon did it first was not that they were especially smart, but \\nbecause they were one of the earliest sites with enough clout to force customers to log in \\nbefore they could buy something. [1]\\nWe, as hackers, know the USPTO is letting people patent the knives and forks of our world. The \\nproblem is, the USPTO are not hackers. They\\'re probably good at judging new inventions for \\ncasting steel or grinding lenses, but they don\\'t understand software yet.\\nAt this point ', ' of our world. The \\nproblem is, the USPTO are not hackers. They\\'re probably good at judging new inventions for \\ncasting steel or grinding lenses, but they don\\'t understand software yet.\\nAt this point an optimist would be tempted to add \"but they will eventually.\" Unfortunately that \\nmight not be true. The problem with software patents is an instance of a more general one: the \\npatent office takes a while to understand new technology. If so, this problem will only get worse, \\nbecause the rate of technological change seems to be increasing. In thirty years, the patent \\noffice may understand the sort of things we now patent as software, but there will be other new \\ntypes of inventions they understand even less.\\nApplying for a patent is a negotiation. You generally apply for a broader patent than you think \\nyou\\'ll be granted, and the examiners reply by throwing out some of your claims and granting \\nothers. So I don\\'t really blame Amazon for applying for the one-click patent. The big mistak', \"han you think \\nyou'll be granted, and the examiners reply by throwing out some of your claims and granting \\nothers. So I don't really blame Amazon for applying for the one-click patent. The big mistake \\nwas the patent office's, for not insisting on something narrower, with real technical content. By \\ngranting such an over-broad patent, the USPTO in effect slept with Amazon on the first date. \\nWas Amazon supposed to say no?\\nWhere Amazon went over to the dark side was not in applying for the patent, but in enforcing it. \\nA lot of companies (Microsoft, for example) have been granted large numbers of preposterously \\nover-broad patents, but they keep them mainly for defensive purposes. Like nuclear weapons, \\nthe main role of big companies' patent portfolios is to threaten anyone who attacks them with a \\ncounter-suit. Amazon's suit against Barnes & Noble was thus the equivalent of a nuclear first \\nstrike.\\nThat suit probably hurt Amazon more than it helped them. Barnes & Noble was a lame site\", \"m with a \\ncounter-suit. Amazon's suit against Barnes & Noble was thus the equivalent of a nuclear first \\nstrike.\\nThat suit probably hurt Amazon more than it helped them. Barnes & Noble was a lame site; \\nAmazon would have crushed them anyway. To attack a rival they could have ignored, Amazon \\nput a lasting black mark on their own reputation. Even now I think if you asked hackers to free-\\nassociate about Amazon, the one-click patent would turn up in the first ten topics.\\nGoogle clearly doesn't feel that merely holding patents is evil. They've applied for a lot of them. \\nAre they hypocrites? Are patents evil?\\nThere are really two variants of that question, and people answering it often aren't clear in their \\nown minds which they're answering. There's a narrow variant: is it bad, given the current legal \\nsystem, to apply for patents? and also a broader one: is it bad that the current legal system \\nallows patents?\\nThese are separate questions. For example, in preindustrial societies like me\", \"rent legal \\nsystem, to apply for patents? and also a broader one: is it bad that the current legal system \\nallows patents?\\nThese are separate questions. For example, in preindustrial societies like medieval Europe, \\nwhen someone attacked you, you didn't call the police. There were no police. When attacked, \\nyou were supposed to fight back, and there were conventions about how to do it. Was this \\nwrong? That's two questions: was it wrong to take justice into your own hands, and was it \\nwrong that you had to? We tend to say yes to the second, but no to the first. If no one else will \\ndefend you, you have to defend yourself. [2]\\nThe situation with patents is similar. Business is a kind of ritualized warfare. Indeed, it evolved \\nfrom actual warfare: most early traders switched on the fly from merchants to pirates depending \\non how strong you seemed. In business there are certain rules describing how companies may \\nand may not compete with one another, and someone deciding that they're goin\", 'merchants to pirates depending \\non how strong you seemed. In business there are certain rules describing how companies may \\nand may not compete with one another, and someone deciding that they\\'re going to play by \\ntheir own rules is missing the point. Saying \"I\\'m not going to apply for patents just because \\neveryone else does\" is not like saying \"I\\'m not going to lie just because everyone else does.\" It\\'s \\nmore like saying \"I\\'m not going to use TCP/IP just because everyone else does.\" Oh yes you \\nare.\\nA closer comparison might be someone seeing a hockey game for the first time, realizing with \\nshock that the players were deliberately bumping into one another, and deciding that one would \\non no account be so rude when playing hockey oneself.\\nHockey allows checking. It\\'s part of the game. If your team refuses to do it, you simply lose. So \\nit is in business. Under the present rules, patents are part of the game.\\nWhat does that mean in practice? We tell the startups we fund not to worry a', \" your team refuses to do it, you simply lose. So \\nit is in business. Under the present rules, patents are part of the game.\\nWhat does that mean in practice? We tell the startups we fund not to worry about infringing \\npatents, because startups rarely get sued for patent infringement. There are only two reasons \\nsomeone might sue you: for money, or to prevent you from competing with them. Startups are \\ntoo poor to be worth suing for money. And in practice they don't seem to get sued much by \\ncompetitors, either. They don't get sued by other startups because (a) patent suits are an \\nexpensive distraction, and (b) since the other startups are as young as they are, their patents \\nprobably haven't issued yet. [3] Nor do startups, at least in the software business, seem to get \\nsued much by established competitors. Despite all the patents Microsoft holds, I don't know of \\nan instance where they sued a startup for patent infringement.

Despite all the patents Microsoft holds, I don't know of \\nan instance where they sued a startup for patent infringement. Companies like Microsoft and \\nOracle don't win by winning lawsuits. That's too uncertain. They win by locking competitors out \\nof their sales channels. If you do manage to threaten them, they're more likely to buy you than \\nsue you.\\nWhen you read of big companies filing patent suits against smaller ones, it's usually a big \\ncompany on the way down, grasping at straws. For example, Unisys's attempts to enforce their \\npatent on LZW compression. When you see a big company threatening patent suits, sell. When \\na company starts fighting over IP\\n, it's a sign they've lost the real battle, for users.\\nA company that sues competitors for patent infringement is like a defender who has been \\nbeaten so thoroughly that he turns to plead with the referee. You don't do that if you can still \\nreach the ball, even if you genuinely believe you've been fouled. So a \", ' like a defender who has been \\nbeaten so thoroughly that he turns to plead with the referee. You don\\'t do that if you can still \\nreach the ball, even if you genuinely believe you\\'ve been fouled. So a company threatening \\npatent suits is a company in trouble.\\nWhen we were working on Viaweb, a bigger company in the e-commerce business was granted \\na patent on online ordering, or something like that. I got a call from a VP there asking if we\\'d \\nlike to license it. I replied that I thought the patent was completely bogus, and would never hold \\nup in court. \"Ok,\" he replied. \"So, are you guys hiring?\"\\nIf your startup grows big enough, however, you\\'ll start to get sued, no matter what you do. If you \\ngo public, for example, you\\'ll be sued by multiple patent trolls who hope you\\'ll pay them off to go \\naway. More on them later.\\nIn other words, no one will sue you for patent infringement till you have money, and once you \\nhave money, people will sue you whether they have grounds to or not. So I ', \" go \\naway. More on them later.\\nIn other words, no one will sue you for patent infringement till you have money, and once you \\nhave money, people will sue you whether they have grounds to or not. So I advise fatalism. \\nDon't waste your time worrying about patent infringement. You're probably violating a patent \\nevery time you tie your shoelaces. At the start, at least, just worry about making something \\ngreat and getting lots of users. If you grow to the point where anyone considers you worth \\nattacking, you're doing well.\\nWe do advise the companies we fund to apply for patents, but not so they can sue competitors. \\nSuccessful startups either get bought or grow into big companies. If a startup wants to grow into \\na big company, they should apply for patents to build up the patent portfolio they'll need to \\nmaintain an armed truce with other big companies. If they want to get bought, they should apply \\nfor patents because patents are part of the mating dance with acquirers.\\nMost startups\", \"they'll need to \\nmaintain an armed truce with other big companies. If they want to get bought, they should apply \\nfor patents because patents are part of the mating dance with acquirers.\\nMost startups that succeed do it by getting bought, and most acquirers care about patents. \\nStartup acquisitions are usually a build-vs-buy decision for the acquirer. Should we buy this little \\nstartup or build our own? And two things, especially, make them decide not to build their own: if \\nyou already have a large and rapidly growing user base, and if you have a fairly solid patent \\napplication on critical parts of your software.\\nThere's a third reason big companies should prefer buying to building: that if they built their \\nown, they'd screw it up. But few big companies are smart enough yet to admit this to \\nthemselves. It's usually the acquirer's engineers who are asked how hard it would be for the \\ncompany to build their own, and they overestimate their abilities. [4] A patent seems to change \\nthe\", \"s to \\nthemselves. It's usually the acquirer's engineers who are asked how hard it would be for the \\ncompany to build their own, and they overestimate their abilities. [4] A patent seems to change \\nthe balance. It gives the acquirer an excuse to admit they couldn't copy what you're doing. It \\nmay also help them to grasp what's special about your technology.\\nFrankly, it surprises me how small a role patents play in the software business. It's kind of ironic, \\nconsidering all the dire things experts say about software patents stifling innovation, but when \\none looks closely at the software business, the most striking thing is how little patents seem to \\nmatter.\\nIn other fields, companies regularly sue competitors for patent infringement. For example, the \\nairport baggage scanning business was for many years a cozy duopoly shared between two \\ncompanies, InVision and L-3. In 2002 a startup called Reveal appeared, with new technology \\nthat let them build scanners a third the size.

In 2002 a startup called Reveal appeared, with new technology \\nthat let them build scanners a third the size. They were sued for patent infringement before \\nthey'd even released a product.\\nYou rarely hear that kind of story in our world. The one example I've found is, embarrassingly \\nenough, Yahoo, which filed a patent suit against a gaming startup called Xfire in 2005. Xfire \\ndoesn't seem to be a very big deal, and it's hard to say why Yahoo felt threatened. Xfire's VP of \\nengineering had worked at Yahoo on similar stuff-- in fact, he was listed as an inventor on the \\npatent Yahoo sued over-- so perhaps there was something personal about it. My guess is that \\nsomeone at Yahoo goofed. At any rate they didn't pursue the suit very vigorously.\\nWhy do patents play so small a role in software?

I can think of three possible reasons.\\nOne is that software is so complicated that patents by themselves are not worth very much. I \\nmay be maligning other fields here, but it seems that in most types of engineering you can hand \\nthe details of some new technique to a group of medium-high quality people and get the \\ndesired result. For example, if someone develops a new process for smelting ore that gets a \\nbetter yield, and you assemble a team of qualified experts and tell them about it, they\\'ll be able \\nto get the same yield. This doesn\\'t seem to work in software. Software is so subtle and \\nunpredictable that \"qualified experts\" don\\'t get you very far.\\nThat\\'s why we rarely hear phrases like \"qualified expert\" in the software business. What that \\nlevel of ability can get you is, say, to make your software compatible with some other piece of \\nsoftware-- in eight months, at enormous cost. To do anything hard', \" in the software business. What that \\nlevel of ability can get you is, say, to make your software compatible with some other piece of \\nsoftware-- in eight months, at enormous cost. To do anything harder you need individual \\nbrilliance. If you assemble a team of qualified experts and tell them to make a new web-based \\nemail program, they'll get their asses kicked by a team of inspired nineteen year olds.\\nExperts can implement, but they can't design. Or rather, expertise in implementation is the only \\nkind most people, including the experts themselves, can measure. [5]\\nBut design is a definite skill. It's not just an airy intangible. Things always seem intangible when \\nyou don't understand them. Electricity seemed an airy intangible to most people in 1800. Who \\nknew there was so much to know about it? So it is with design. Some people are good at it and \\nsome people are bad at it, and there's something very tangible they're good or bad at.\\nThe reason design counts so much in software is \", \" about it? So it is with design. Some people are good at it and \\nsome people are bad at it, and there's something very tangible they're good or bad at.\\nThe reason design counts so much in software is probably that there are fewer constraints than \\non physical things. Building physical things is expensive and dangerous. The space of possible \\nchoices is smaller; you tend to have to work as part of a larger group; and you're subject to a lot \\nof regulations. You don't have any of that if you and a couple friends decide to create a new \\nweb-based application.\\nBecause there's so much scope for design in software, a successful application tends to be way \\nmore than the sum of its patents. What protects little companies from being copied by bigger \\ncompetitors is not just their patents, but the thousand little things the big company will get \\nwrong if they try.\\nThe second reason patents don't count for much in our world is that startups rarely attack big \\ncompanies head-on, the way Reveal di\", \"thousand little things the big company will get \\nwrong if they try.\\nThe second reason patents don't count for much in our world is that startups rarely attack big \\ncompanies head-on, the way Reveal did. In the software business, startups beat established \\ncompanies by transcending them. Startups don't build desktop word processing programs to \\ncompete with Microsoft Word. [6] They build Writely. If this paradigm is crowded, just wait for the \\nnext one; they run pretty frequently on this route.\\nFortunately for startups, big companies are extremely good at denial. If you take the trouble to \\nattack them from an oblique angle, they'll meet you half-way and maneuver to keep you in their \\nblind spot. To sue a startup would mean admitting it was dangerous, and that often means \\nseeing something the big company doesn't want to see.

Companies building web based apps are similarly \\nprotected from Microsoft, which even now doesn't want to imagine a world in which Windows is \\nirrelevant.\\nThe third reason patents don't seem to matter very much in software is public opinion-- or \\nrather, hacker opinion. In a recent interview, Steve Ballmer coyly left open the possibility of \\nattacking Linux on patent grounds. But I doubt Microsoft would ever be so stupid. They'd face \\nthe mother of all boycotts. And not just from the technical community in general; a lot of their \\nown people would rebel.\\nGood hackers care a lot about matters of principle, and they are highly mobile.

Perhaps we can split the \\ndifference and say that mobility gives hackers the luxury of being principled.\\nGoogle\\'s \"don\\'t be evil\" policy may for this reason be the most valuable thing they\\'ve \\ndiscovered. It\\'s very constraining in some ways. If Google does do something evil, they get \\ndoubly whacked for it: once for whatever they did, and again for hypocrisy. But I think it\\'s worth \\nit. It helps them to hire the best people, and it\\'s better, even from a purely selfish point of view, \\nto be constrained by principles than by stupidity.\\n(I wish someone would get this point across to the present administration.)\\nI\\'m not sure what the proportions are of the preceding three ingr', ' view, \\nto be constrained by principles than by stupidity.\\n(I wish someone would get this point across to the present administration.)\\nI\\'m not sure what the proportions are of the preceding three ingredients, but the custom among \\nthe big companies seems to be not to sue the small ones, and the startups are mostly too busy \\nand too poor to sue one another. So despite the huge number of software patents there\\'s not a \\nlot of suing going on. With one exception: patent trolls.\\nPatent trolls are companies consisting mainly of lawyers whose whole business is to \\naccumulate patents and threaten to sue companies who actually make things. Patent trolls, it \\nseems safe to say, are evil. I feel a bit stupid saying that, because when you\\'re saying \\nsomething that Richard Stallman and Bill Gates would both agree with, you must be perilously \\nclose to tautologies.\\nThe CEO of Forgent, one of the most notorious patent trolls, says that what his company does \\nis \"the American way.\" Actually that\\'s not', ' both agree with, you must be perilously \\nclose to tautologies.\\nThe CEO of Forgent, one of the most notorious patent trolls, says that what his company does \\nis \"the American way.\" Actually that\\'s not true. The American way is to make money by creating \\nwealth, not by suing people. [7] What companies like Forgent do is actually the proto-industrial \\nway. In the period just before the industrial revolution, some of the greatest fortunes in countries \\nlike England and France were made by courtiers who extracted some lucrative right from the \\ncrown-- like the right to collect taxes on the import of silk-- and then used this to squeeze \\nmoney from the merchants in that business. So when people compare patent trolls to the mafia, \\nthey\\'re more right than they know, because the mafia too are not merely bad, but bad \\nspecifically in the sense of being an obsolete business model.\\nPatent trolls seem to have caught big companies by surprise.

In the last couple years they've \\nextracted hundreds of millions of dollars from them. Patent trolls are hard to fight precisely \\nbecause they create nothing. Big companies are safe from being sued by other big companies \\nbecause they can threaten a counter-suit. But because patent trolls don't make anything, \\nthere's nothing they can be sued for. I predict this loophole will get closed fairly quickly, at least \\nby legal standards. It's clearly an abuse of the system, and the victims are powerful. [8]\\nBut evil as patent trolls are, I don't think they hamper innovation much. They don't sue till a \\nstartup has made money, and by that point the innovation that generated it has already \\nhappened. I can't think of a startup that avoided working on some problem because of patent \\ntrolls.\\nSo much for hockey as the game is played now.

What about the more theoretical question of \\nwhether hockey would be a better game without checking? Do patents encourage or \\ndiscourage innovation?\\nThis is a very hard question to answer in the general case. People write whole books on the \\ntopic. One of my main hobbies is the history of technology, and even though I've studied the \\nsubject for years, it would take me several weeks of research to be able to say whether patents \\nhave in general been a net win.\\nOne thing I can say is that 99.9% of the people who express opinions on the subject do it not \\nbased on such research, but out of a kind of religious conviction.

You don't get a \\npatent for nothing. In return for the exclusive right to use an idea, you have to publish it, and it \\nwas largely to encourage such openness that patents were established.\\nBefore patents, people protected ideas by keeping them secret. With patents, central \\ngovernments said, in effect, if you tell everyone your idea, we'll protect it for you. There is a \\nparallel here to the rise of civil order, which happened at roughly the same time. Before central \\ngovernments were powerful enough to enforce order, rich people had private armies.

We might like to think \\nwe wouldn\\'t go so far, but the movie industry has already tried to pass laws prescribing three \\nyear prison terms just for putting movies on public networks. Want to try a frightening thought \\nexperiment? If the movie industry could have any law they wanted, where would they stop? \\nShort of the death penalty, one assumes, but how close would they get?\\nEven worse than the spectacular abuses might be the overall decrease in efficiency that would \\naccompany increased secrecy. As anyone who has dealt with organizations that operate on a \\n\"need to know\" basis can attest, dividing information up into little cells is terribly inefficient.

This would encourage what is already \\nthe worst trait of big companies.\\nI\\'m not saying secrecy would be worse than patents, just that we couldn\\'t discard patents for \\nfree. Businesses would become more secretive to compensate, and in some fields this might \\nget ugly. Nor am I defending the current patent system. There is clearly a lot that\\'s broken about \\nit.

At least, that's what we advise, and we bet money on that advice.\\nThe only real role of patents, for most startups, is as an element of the mating dance with \\nacquirers. There patents do help a little. And so they do encourage innovation indirectly, in that \\nthey give more power to startups, which is where, pound for pound, the most innovation \\nhappens.

Ordinarily you\\'d do this for shopping searches, though in \\nfact one of the features of our scheme is that it automatically detects which searches are \\nshopping searches.\\nIf you just order the results in order of bids, you can make the search results useless, because \\nthe first results could be dominated by lame sites that had bid the most.

Get funded by Y Combinator. \\n January 2006\\nTo do something well you have to like it. That idea is not exactly novel. We\\'ve got it down to four \\nwords: \"Do what you love.\" But it\\'s not enough just to tell people that. Doing what you love is \\ncomplicated.\\nThe very idea is foreign to what most of us learn as kids. When I was a kid, it seemed as if work \\nand fun were opposites by definition. Life had two states: some of the time adults were making \\nyou do things, and that was called work; the rest of the time you could do what you wanted, and \\nthat was called playing. Occasionally the things adults made you do were fun, just as, \\noccasionally, playing wasn\\'t — for example, if you fell and hurt yourself. But except for ', \"what you wanted, and \\nthat was called playing. Occasionally the things adults made you do were fun, just as, \\noccasionally, playing wasn't — for example, if you fell and hurt yourself. But except for these few \\nanomalous cases, work was pretty much defined as not-fun.\\nAnd it did not seem to be an accident. School, it was implied, was tedious because it was \\npreparation for grownup work.\\nThe world then was divided into two groups, grownups and kids. Grownups, like some kind of \\ncursed race, had to work. Kids didn't, but they did have to go to school, which was a dilute \\nversion of work meant to prepare us for the real thing. Much as we disliked school, the \\ngrownups all agreed that grownup work was worse, and that we had it easy.\\nTeachers in particular all seemed to believe implicitly that work was not fun. Which is not \\nsurprising: work wasn't fun for most of them. Why did we have to memorize state capitals \\ninstead of playing dodgeball? For the same reason they had to watch over a bun\", \"work was not fun. Which is not \\nsurprising: work wasn't fun for most of them. Why did we have to memorize state capitals \\ninstead of playing dodgeball? For the same reason they had to watch over a bunch of kids \\ninstead of lying on a beach. You couldn't just do what you wanted.\\nI'm not saying we should let little kids do whatever they want. They may have to be made to \\nwork on certain things. But if we make kids work on dull stuff, it might be wise to tell them that \\ntediousness is not the defining quality of work, and indeed that the reason they have to work on \\ndull stuff now is so they can work on more interesting stuff later. [1]\\nOnce, when I was about 9 or 10, my father told me I could be whatever I wanted when I grew \\nup, so long as I enjoyed it. I remember that precisely because it seemed so anomalous. It was \\nlike being told to use dry water. Whatever I thought he meant, I didn't think he meant work could \\nliterally be fun — fun like playing. It took me years to grasp that.\\nJob\", \"seemed so anomalous. It was \\nlike being told to use dry water.

It took me years to grasp that.\\nJobs\\nBy high school, the prospect of an actual job was on the horizon. Adults would sometimes \\ncome to speak to us about their work, or we would go to see them at work. It was always \\nunderstood that they enjoyed what they did. In retrospect I think one may have: the private jet \\npilot. But I don't think the bank manager really did.\\nThe main reason they all acted as if they enjoyed their work was presumably the upper-middle \\nclass convention that you're supposed to. It would not merely be bad for your career to say that \\nyou despised your job, but a social faux-pas.\\nWhy is it conventional to pretend to like what you do? The first sentence of this essay explains \\nthat. If you have to like something to do it well, then the most successful people will all like what \\nthey do. That's where the upp\", 'end to like what you do? The first sentence of this essay explains \\nthat.

Just as houses all over \\nAmerica are full of chairs that are, without the owners even knowing it, nth-degree imitations of \\nchairs designed 250 years ago for French kings, conventional attitudes about work are, without \\nthe owners even knowing it, nth-degree imitations of the attitudes of people who\\'ve done great \\nthings.\\nWhat a recipe for alienation. By the time they reach an age to think about what they\\'d like to do, \\nmost kids have been thoroughly misled about the idea of loving one\\'s work. School has trained \\nthem to regard work as an unpleasant duty. Having a job is said to be even more onerous than \\nschoolwork. And yet all the adults claim to like what they do. You can\\'t blame kids for thinking \"I \\nam not like these people; I am not suited to thi', 'Having a job is said to be even more onerous than \\nschoolwork.

If you take a boring job to give your \\nfamily a high standard of living, as so many people do, you risk infecting your kids with the idea \\nthat work is boring. [2] Maybe it would be better for kids in this one case if parents were not so \\nunselfish. A parent who set an example of loving their work might help their kids more than an \\nexpensive house.

Then the impo', \"of loving their work might help their kids more than an \\nexpensive house. [3]\\nIt was not till I was in college that the idea of work finally broke free from the idea of making a \\nliving. Then the important question became not how to make money, but what to work on. \\nIdeally these coincided, but some spectacular boundary cases (like Einstein in the patent office) \\nproved they weren't identical.\\nThe definition of work was now to make some original contribution to the world, and in the \\nprocess not to starve. But after the habit of so many years my idea of work still included a large \\ncomponent of pain. Work still seemed to require discipline, because only hard problems yielded \\ngrand results, and hard problems couldn't literally be fun. Surely one had to force oneself to \\nwork on them.\\nIf you think something's supposed to hurt, you're less likely to notice if you're doing it wrong. \\nThat about sums up my experience of graduate school.\\nBounds\\nHow much are you supposed to like what you do?\", \"u think something's supposed to hurt, you're less likely to notice if you're doing it wrong. \\nThat about sums up my experience of graduate school.\\nBounds\\nHow much are you supposed to like what you do? Unless you know that, you don't know when \\nto stop searching. And if, like most people, you underestimate it, you'll tend to stop searching \\ntoo early. You'll end up doing something chosen for you by your parents, or the desire to make \\nmoney, or prestige — or sheer inertia.\\nHere's an upper bound: Do what you love doesn't mean, do what you would like to do most this \\nsecond. Even Einstein probably had moments when he wanted to have a cup of coffee, but told \\nhimself he ought to finish what he was working on first.\\nIt used to perplex me when I read about people who liked what they did so much that there was \\nnothing they'd rather do. There didn't seem to be any sort of work I liked that much. If I had a \\nchoice of (a) spending the next hour working on something or (b) be teleported to Rome\", 'that there was \\nnothing they\\'d rather do.

If I had a \\nchoice of (a) spending the next hour working on something or (b) be teleported to Rome and \\nspend the next hour wandering about, was there any sort of work I\\'d prefer? Honestly, no.\\nBut the fact is, almost anyone would rather, at any given moment, float about in the Carribbean, \\nor have sex, or eat some delicious food, than work on hard problems. The rule about doing \\nwhat you love assumes a certain length of time. It doesn\\'t mean, do what will make you \\nhappiest this second, but what will make you happiest over some longer period, like a week or a \\nmonth.\\nUnproductive pleasures pall eventually. After a while you get tired of lying on the beach. If you \\nwant to stay happy, you have to do something.\\nAs a lower bound, you have to like your work more than any unproductive pleasure. You have to \\nlike what you do enough that the concept of \"spare time\" seems mistaken.

You have to \\nlike what you do enough that the concept of \"spare time\" seems mistaken. Which is not to say \\nyou have to spend all your time working. You can only work so much before you get tired and \\nstart to screw up. Then you want to do something else — even something mindless. But you \\ndon\\'t regard this time as the prize and the time you spend working as the pain you endure to \\nearn it.\\nI put the lower bound there for practical reasons. If your work is not your favorite thing to do, \\nyou\\'ll have terrible problems with procrastination. You\\'ll have to force yourself to work, and when \\nyou resort to that the results are distinctly inferior.\\nTo be happy I think you have to be doing something you not only enjoy, but admire.

What there has to be is a \\ntest.\\nSo one thing that falls just short of the standard, I think, is reading books. Except for some \\nbooks in math and the hard sciences, there's no test of how well you've read a book, and that's \\nwhy merely reading books doesn't quite feel like work. You have to do something with what \\nyou've read to feel productive.\\nI think the best test is one Gino Lee taught me: to try to do things that would make your friends \\nsay wow. But it probably wouldn't start to work properly till about age 22, because most people \\nhaven't had a big enough sample to pick friends from before then.\\nSirens\\nWhat you should not do, I think, is worry about the opinion of anyone beyon\", \"rk properly till about age 22, because most people \\nhaven't had a big enough sample to pick friends from before then.\\nSirens\\nWhat you should not do, I think, is worry about the opinion of anyone beyond your friends. You \\nshouldn't worry about prestige. Prestige is the opinion of the rest of the world. When you can \\nask the opinions of people whose judgement you respect, what does it add to consider the \\nopinions of people you don't even know? [4]\\nThis is easy advice to give. It's hard to follow, especially when you're young. [5] Prestige is like a \\npowerful magnet that warps even your beliefs about what you enjoy. It causes you to work not \\non what you like, but what you'd like to like.\\nThat's what leads people to try to write novels, for example. They like reading novels. They \\nnotice that people who write them win Nobel prizes. What could be more wonderful, they think, \\nthan to be a novelist? But liking the idea of being a novelist is not enough; you have to like the \\nactual work of \", \"t people who write them win Nobel prizes.

But liking the idea of being a novelist is not enough; you have to like the \\nactual work of novel-writing if you're going to be good at it; you have to like making up elaborate \\nlies.\\nPrestige is just fossilized inspiration. If you do anything well enough, you'll make it prestigious. \\nPlenty of things we now consider prestigious were anything but at first. Jazz comes to mind — \\nthough almost any established art form would do. So just do what you like, and let prestige take \\ncare of itself.\\nPrestige is especially dangerous to the ambitious. If you want to make ambitious people waste \\ntheir time on errands, the way to do it is to bait the hook with prestige. That's the recipe for \\ngetting people to give talks, write forewords, serve on committees, be department heads, and \\nso on. It might be a good rule simply to avoid any prestigious task.

It might be a good rule simply to avoid any prestigious task. If it didn\\'t suck, they wouldn\\'t \\nhave had to make it prestigious.\\nSimilarly, if you admire two kinds of work equally, but one is more prestigious, you should \\nprobably choose the other. Your opinions about what\\'s admirable are always going to be slightly \\ninfluenced by prestige, so if the two seem equal to you, you probably have more genuine \\nadmiration for the less prestigious one.\\nThe other big force leading people astray is money. Money by itself is not that dangerous. When \\nsomething pays well but is regarded with contempt, like telemarketing, or prostitution, or \\npersonal injury litigation, ambitious people aren\\'t tempted by it. That kind of work ends up being \\ndone by people who are \"just trying to make a living.\" (Tip: avoid any field whose practitioners \\nsay this.)

That kind of work ends up being \\ndone by people who are \"just trying to make a living.\" (Tip: avoid any field whose practitioners \\nsay this.) The danger is when money is combined with prestige, as in, say, corporate law, or \\nmedicine. A comparatively safe and prosperous career with some automatic baseline prestige is \\ndangerously tempting to someone young, who hasn\\'t thought much about what they really like.\\nThe test of whether people love what they do is whether they\\'d do it even if they weren\\'t paid for \\nit — even if they had to work at another job to make a living. How many corporate lawyers \\nwould do their current work if they had to do it for free, in their spare time, and take day jobs as \\nwaiters to support themselves?\\nThis test is especially helpful in deciding between different kinds of academic work, because \\nfields vary greatly in this respect.

Most good mathematicians would work on math even if there \\nwere no jobs as math professors, whereas in the departments at the other end of the spectrum, \\nthe availability of teaching jobs is the driver: people would rather be English professors than \\nwork in ad agencies, and publishing papers is the way you compete for such jobs. Math would \\nhappen without math departments, but it is the existence of English majors, and therefore jobs \\nteaching them, that calls into being all those thousands of dreary papers about gender and \\nidentity in the novels of Conrad. No one does that kind of thing for fun.\\nThe advice of parents will tend to err on the side of money. It seems safe to say there are more \\nundergrads who want to be novelists and whose parents want them to be doctors than who \\nwant to be doctors and whose parents want them to be novelists.

If \\nyour eight year old son decides to climb a tall tree, or your teenage daughter decides to date \\nthe local bad boy, you won\\'t get a share in the excitement, but if your son falls, or your daughter \\ngets pregnant, you\\'ll have to deal with the consequences.\\nDiscipline\\nWith such powerful forces leading us astray, it\\'s not surprising we find it so hard to discover \\nwhat we like to work on.

Not necessarily, but probably.\\nAlthough doing great work takes less discipline than people think — because the way to do \\ngreat work is to find something you like so much that you don't have to force yourself to do it — \\nfinding work you love does usually require discipline.

Some people are lucky enough to know \\nwhat they want to do when they're 12, and just glide along as if they were on railroad tracks. But \\nthis seems the exception. More often people who do great things have careers with the \\ntrajectory of a ping-pong ball. They go to school to study A, drop out and get a job doing B, and \\nthen become famous for C after taking it up on the side.\\nSometimes jumping from one sort of work to another is a sign of energy, and sometimes it's a \\nsign of laziness. Are you dropping out, or boldly carving a new path? You often can't tell \\nyourself. Plenty of people who will later do great things seem to be disappointments early on, \\nwhen they're trying to find their niche.\\nIs there some test you can use to keep yourself honest?

Perhaps more importantly, you\\'ll get into the habit of \\ndoing things well.\\nAnother test you can use is: always produce. For example, if you have a day job you don\\'t take \\nseriously because you plan to be a novelist, are you producing? Are you writing pages of \\nfiction, however bad? As long as you\\'re producing, you\\'ll know you\\'re not merely using the hazy \\nvision of the grand novel you plan to write one day as an opiate. The view of it will be obstructed \\nby the all too palpably flawed one you\\'re actually writing.\\n\"Always produce\" is also a heuristic for finding the work you love. If you subject yourself to that \\nconstraint, it will automatically push you away from things you think you\\'re supposed to work on, \\ntoward things you actually like. \"Always produce\" will discover your life\\'s', 'subject yourself to that \\nconstraint, it will automatically push you away from things you think you\\'re supposed to work on, \\ntoward things you actually like. \"Always produce\" will discover your life\\'s work the way water, \\nwith the aid of gravity, finds the hole in your roof.\\nOf course, figuring out what you like to work on doesn\\'t mean you get to work on it. That\\'s a \\nseparate question. And if you\\'re ambitious you have to keep them separate: you have to make a \\nconscious effort to keep your ideas about what you want from being contaminated by what \\nseems possible. [6]\\nIt\\'s painful to keep them apart, because it\\'s painful to observe the gap between them. So most \\npeople pre-emptively lower their expectations. For example, if you asked random people on the \\nstreet if they\\'d like to be able to draw like Leonardo, you\\'d find most would say something like \\n\"Oh, I can\\'t draw.\" This is more a statement of intention than fact; it means, I\\'m not going to try. \\nBecause the fact is, if you took a', 'o draw like Leonardo, you\\'d find most would say something like \\n\"Oh, I can\\'t draw.\" This is more a statement of intention than fact; it means, I\\'m not going to try. \\nBecause the fact is, if you took a random person off the street and somehow got them to work \\nas hard as they possibly could at drawing for the next twenty years, they\\'d get surprisingly far. \\nBut it would require a great moral effort; it would mean staring failure in the eye every day for \\nyears. And so to protect themselves people say \"I can\\'t.\"\\nAnother related line you often hear is that not everyone can do work they love — that someone \\nhas to do the unpleasant jobs. Really? How do you make them? In the US the only mechanism \\nfor forcing people to do unpleasant jobs is the draft, and that hasn\\'t been invoked for over 30 \\nyears. All we can do is encourage people to do unpleasant work, with money and prestige.\\nIf there\\'s something people still won\\'t do, it seems as if society just has to make do without. \\nThat\\'s what hap', 'ears. All we can do is encourage people to do unpleasant work, with money and prestige.\\nIf there\\'s something people still won\\'t do, it seems as if society just has to make do without. \\nThat\\'s what happened with domestic servants. For millennia that was the canonical example of \\na job \"someone had to do.\" And yet in the mid twentieth century servants practically \\ndisappeared in rich countries, and the rich have just had to do without.\\nSo while there may be some things someone has to do, there\\'s a good chance anyone saying \\nthat about any particular job is mistaken. Most unpleasant jobs would either get automated or \\ngo undone if no one were willing to do them.\\nTwo Routes\\nThere\\'s another sense of \"not everyone can do work they love\" that\\'s all too true, however. One \\nhas to make a living, and it\\'s hard to get paid for doing work you love. There are two routes to \\nthat destination: The organic route: as you become more eminent, gradually to increase the \\nparts of your job that you like at', 'd it\\'s hard to get paid for doing work you love. There are two routes to \\nthat destination: The organic route: as you become more eminent, gradually to increase the \\nparts of your job that you like at the expense of those you don\\'t.\\nThe two-job route: to work at things you don\\'t like to get money to work on things you do. The \\norganic route is more common. It happens naturally to anyone who does good work. A young \\narchitect has to take whatever work he can get, but if he does well he\\'ll gradually be in a \\nposition to pick and choose among projects. The disadvantage of this route is that it\\'s slow and \\nuncertain. Even tenure is not real freedom.\\nThe two-job route has several variants depending on how long you work for money at a time. At \\none extreme is the \"day job,\" where you work regular hours at one job to make money, and \\nwork on what you love in your spare time. At the other extreme you work at something till you \\nmake enough not to have to work for money again.\\nThe two-job route', \"r hours at one job to make money, and \\nwork on what you love in your spare time. At the other extreme you work at something till you \\nmake enough not to have to work for money again.\\nThe two-job route is less common than the organic route, because it requires a deliberate \\nchoice. It's also more dangerous. Life tends to get more expensive as you get older, so it's easy \\nto get sucked into working longer than you expected at the money job. Worse still, anything you \\nwork on changes you. If you work too long on tedious stuff, it will rot your brain. And the best \\npaying jobs are most dangerous, because they require your full attention.\\nThe advantage of the two-job route is that it lets you jump over obstacles. The landscape of \\npossible jobs isn't flat; there are walls of varying heights between different kinds of work.

[7] The \\ntrick of maximizing the parts of your job that you like can get you from architecture to product \\ndesign, but not, probably, to music. If you make money doing one thing and then work on \\nanother, you have more freedom of choice.\\nWhich route should you take? That depends on how sure you are of what you want to do, how \\ngood you are at taking orders, how much risk you can stand, and the odds that anyone will pay \\n(in your lifetime) for what you want to do. If you're sure of the general area you want to work in \\nand it's something people are likely to pay you for, then you should probably take the organic \\nroute. But if you don't know what you want to work on, or don't like to take orders, you may want \\nto take the two-job route, if you can stand the risk.\\nDon't decide too soon.

When \\npeople applying to medical school ask her for advice, she wants to shake them and yell \"Don\\'t \\ndo it!\" (But she never does.) How did she get into this fix?

So could it be that \\nprocrastination isn't always bad?\\nMost people who write about procrastination write about how to cure it. But this is, strictly \\nspeaking, impossible. There are an infinite number of things you could be doing. No matter \\nwhat you work on, you're not working on everything else. So the question is not how to avoid \\nprocrastination, but how to procrastinate well.\\nThere are three variants of procrastination, depending on what you do instead of working on \\nsomething: you could work on (a) nothing, (b) something less important, or (c) something more \\nimportant. That las\", 're three variants of procrastination, depending on what you do instead of working on \\nsomething: you could work on (a) nothing, (b) something less important, or (c) something more \\nimportant. That last type, I\\'d argue, is good procrastination.\\nThat\\'s the \"absent-minded professor,\" who forgets to shave, or eat, or even perhaps look where \\nhe\\'s going while he\\'s thinking about some interesting question. His mind is absent from the \\neveryday world because it\\'s hard at work in another.\\nThat\\'s the sense in which the most impressive people I know are all procrastinators. They\\'re \\ntype-C procrastinators: they put off working on small stuff to work on big stuff.\\nWhat\\'s \"small stuff?\" Roughly, work that has zero chance of being mentioned in your obituary. \\nIt\\'s hard to say at the time what will turn out to be your best work (will it be your magnum opus \\non Sumerian temple architecture, or the detective thriller you wrote under a pseudonym?), but \\nthere\\'s a whole class of tasks you can safely rul', \" out to be your best work (will it be your magnum opus \\non Sumerian temple architecture, or the detective thriller you wrote under a pseudonym?), but \\nthere's a whole class of tasks you can safely rule out: shaving, doing your laundry, cleaning the \\nhouse, writing thank-you notes—anything that might be called an errand.\\nGood procrastination is avoiding errands to do real work.\\nGood in a sense, at least. The people who want you to do the errands won't think it's good. But \\nyou probably have to annoy them if you want to get anything done. The mildest seeming \\npeople, if they want to do real work, all have a certain degree of ruthlessness when it comes to \\navoiding errands.\\nSome errands, like replying to letters, go away if you ignore them (perhaps taking friends with \\nthem). Others, like mowing the lawn, or filing tax returns, only get worse if you put them off. In \\nprinciple it shouldn't work to put off the second kind of errand. You're going to have to do \\nwhatever it is eventually. Wh\", \"ing the lawn, or filing tax returns, only get worse if you put them off. In \\nprinciple it shouldn't work to put off the second kind of errand. You're going to have to do \\nwhatever it is eventually. Why not (as past-due notices are always saying) do it now?\\nThe reason it pays to put off even those errands is that real work needs two things errands \\ndon't: big chunks of time, and the right mood. If you get inspired by some project, it can be a net \\nwin to blow off everything you were supposed to do for the next few days to work on it. Yes, \\nthose errands may cost you more time when you finally get around to them. But if you get a lot \\ndone during those few days, you will be net more productive.\\nIn fact, it may not be a difference in degree, but a difference in kind. There may be types of work \\nthat can only be done in long, uninterrupted stretches, when inspiration hits, rather than dutifully \\nin scheduled little slices. Empirically it seems to be so. When I think of the people I know wh\", \"k \\nthat can only be done in long, uninterrupted stretches, when inspiration hits, rather than dutifully \\nin scheduled little slices. Empirically it seems to be so. When I think of the people I know who've \\ndone great things, I don't imagine them dutifully crossing items off to-do lists. I imagine them \\nsneaking off to work on some new idea.\\nConversely, forcing someone to perform errands synchronously is bound to limit their \\nproductivity. The cost of an interruption is not just the time it takes, but that it breaks the time on \\neither side in half. You probably only have to interrupt someone a couple times a day before \\nthey're unable to work on hard problems at all.\\nI've wondered a lot about why startups are most productive at the very beginning, when they're \\njust a couple guys in an apartment. The main reason may be that there's no one to interrupt \\nthem yet. In theory it's good when the founders finally get enough money to hire people to do \\nsome of the work for them.

In theory it\\'s good when the founders finally get enough money to hire people to do \\nsome of the work for them. But it may be better to be overworked than interrupted. Once you \\ndilute a startup with ordinary office workers—with type-B procrastinators—the whole company \\nstarts to resonate at their frequency. They\\'re interrupt-driven, and soon you are too.\\nErrands are so effective at killing great projects that a lot of people use them for that purpose. \\nSomeone who has decided to write a novel, for example, will suddenly find that the house \\nneeds cleaning. People who fail to write novels don\\'t do it by sitting in front of a blank page for \\ndays without writing anything. They do it by feeding the cat, going out to buy something they \\nneed for their apartment, meeting a friend for coffee, checking email. \"I don\\'t have time to work,\" \\nthey say. And they don\\'t; they\\'ve made sure of that.\\n(There\\'s also a variant whe', 'uy something they \\nneed for their apartment, meeting a friend for coffee, checking email. \"I don\\'t have time to work,\" \\nthey say. And they don\\'t; they\\'ve made sure of that.\\n(There\\'s also a variant where one has no place to work. The cure is to visit the places where \\nfamous people worked, and see how unsuitable they were.)\\nI\\'ve used both these excuses at one time or another. I\\'ve learned a lot of tricks for making \\nmyself work over the last 20 years, but even now I don\\'t win consistently. Some days I get real \\nwork done. Other days are eaten up by errands. And I know it\\'s usually my fault: I let errands \\neat up the day, to avoid facing some hard problem.\\nThe most dangerous form of procrastination is unacknowledged type-B procrastination, \\nbecause it doesn\\'t feel like procrastination. You\\'re \"getting things done.\" Just the wrong things.\\nAny advice about procrastination that concentrates on crossing things off your to-do list is not \\nonly incomplete, but positively misleading, if it does', 'e \"getting things done.\" Just the wrong things.\\nAny advice about procrastination that concentrates on crossing things off your to-do list is not \\nonly incomplete, but positively misleading, if it doesn\\'t consider the possibility that the to-do list \\nis itself a form of type-B procrastination. In fact, possibility is too weak a word. Nearly \\neveryone\\'s is. Unless you\\'re working on the biggest things you could be working on, you\\'re type-\\nB procrastinating, no matter how much you\\'re getting done.\\nIn his famous essay You and Your Research (which I recommend to anyone ambitious, no \\nmatter what they\\'re working on), Richard Hamming suggests that you ask yourself three \\nquestions: What are the most important problems in your field?\\n Are you working on one of them?\\n Why not? Hamming was at Bell Labs when he started asking such questions. In principle \\nanyone there ought to have been able to work on the most important problems in their field. \\nPerhaps not everyone can make an equally dramatic m', \"bs when he started asking such questions. In principle \\nanyone there ought to have been able to work on the most important problems in their field. \\nPerhaps not everyone can make an equally dramatic mark on the world; I don't know; but \\nwhatever your capacities, there are projects that stretch them. So Hamming's exercise can be \\ngeneralized to: What's the best thing you could be working on, and why aren't you? Most people \\nwill shy away from this question. I shy away from it myself; I see it there on the page and quickly \\nmove on to the next sentence. Hamming used to go around actually asking people this, and it \\ndidn't make him popular. But it's a question anyone ambitious should face.\\nThe trouble is, you may end up hooking a very big fish with this bait. To do good work, you need \\nto do more than find good projects. Once you've found them, you have to get yourself to work \\non them, and that can be hard. The bigger the problem, the harder it is to get yourself to work \\non it.\\nOf cours\", \"more than find good projects. Once you've found them, you have to get yourself to work \\non them, and that can be hard. The bigger the problem, the harder it is to get yourself to work \\non it.\\nOf course, the main reason people find it difficult to work on a particular problem is that they \\ndon't enjoy it. When you're young, especially, you often find yourself working on stuff you don't \\nreally like-- because it seems impressive, for example, or because you've been assigned to \\nwork on it. Most grad students are stuck working on big problems they don't really like, and grad \\nschool is thus synonymous with procrastination.\\nBut even when you like what you're working on, it's easier to get yourself to work on small \\nproblems than big ones. Why? Why is it so hard to work on big problems? One reason is that \\nyou may not get any reward in the forseeable future. If you work on something you can finish in \\na day or two, you can expect to have a nice feeling of accomplishment fairly soon. If the \", \"son is that \\nyou may not get any reward in the forseeable future. If you work on something you can finish in \\na day or two, you can expect to have a nice feeling of accomplishment fairly soon. If the reward \\nis indefinitely far in the future, it seems less real.\\nAnother reason people don't work on big projects is, ironically, fear of wasting time. What if they \\nfail? Then all the time they spent on it will be wasted. (In fact it probably won't be, because work \\non hard projects almost always leads somewhere.)\\nBut the trouble with big problems can't be just that they promise no immediate reward and \\nmight cause you to waste a lot of time. If that were all, they'd be no worse than going to visit \\nyour in-laws. There's more to it than that. Big problems are terrifying. There's an almost physical \\npain in facing them. It's like having a vacuum cleaner hooked up to your imagination. All your \\ninitial ideas get sucked out immediately, and you don't have any more, and yet the vacuum \\ncleaner \", \"cal \\npain in facing them.

You can tighten the angle once you get going, just as a sailboat can sail closer to \\nthe wind once it gets underway.\\nIf you want to work on big things, you seem to have to trick yourself into doing it.

There was that same odd atmosphere created by \\na large number of people determined not to miss out. Miss out on what? They didn\\'t know. \\nWhatever was going to happen—whatever Web 2.0 turned out to be.\\nI wouldn\\'t quite call it \"Bubble 2.0\" just because VCs are eager to invest again. The Internet is a \\ngenuinely big deal. The bust was as much an overreaction as the boom. It\\'s to be expected that \\nonce we started to pull out of the bust, there would be a lot of growth in this area, just as there \\nwas in the industries that spiked the sharpest before the Depression.\\nThe reason this won\\'t turn into a second Bubble is that the IPO market is gone. Venture \\ninvestors are driven by exit strategies. The reason they were funding all those laughable \\nstartups during the late 90s was that they hoped to sell them to gullible retail investors; they \\nhoped to be laughing all the way ', 'y exit strategies. The reason they were funding all those laughable \\nstartups during the late 90s was that they hoped to sell them to gullible retail investors; they \\nhoped to be laughing all the way to the bank. Now that route is closed. Now the default exit \\nstrategy is to get bought, and acquirers are less prone to irrational exuberance than IPO \\ninvestors. The closest you\\'ll get to Bubble valuations is Rupert Murdoch paying $580 million for \\nMyspace. That\\'s only off by a factor of 10 or so.\\n1. Ajax\\nDoes \"Web 2.0\" mean anything more than the name of a conference yet? I don\\'t like to admit it, \\nbut it\\'s starting to. When people say \"Web 2.0\" now, I have some idea what they mean. And the \\nfact that I both despise the phrase and understand it is the surest proof that it has started to \\nmean something.\\nOne ingredient of its meaning is certainly Ajax, which I can still only just bear to use without \\nscare quotes. Basically, what \"Ajax\" means is \"Javascript now works.\" And that in turn me', 'n something.\\nOne ingredient of its meaning is certainly Ajax, which I can still only just bear to use without \\nscare quotes. Basically, what \"Ajax\" means is \"Javascript now works.\" And that in turn means \\nthat web-based applications can now be made to work much more like desktop ones.\\nAs you read this, a whole new generation of software is being written to take advantage of Ajax. \\nThere hasn\\'t been such a wave of new applications since microcomputers first appeared. Even \\nMicrosoft sees it, but it\\'s too late for them to do anything more than leak \"internal\" documents \\ndesigned to give the impression they\\'re on top of this new trend.\\nIn fact the new generation of software is being written way too fast for Microsoft even to channel \\nit, let alone write their own in house. Their only hope now is to buy all the best Ajax startups \\nbefore Google does. And even that\\'s going to be hard, because Google has as big a head start \\nin buying microstartups as it did in search a few years ago. After ', ' is to buy all the best Ajax startups \\nbefore Google does. And even that\\'s going to be hard, because Google has as big a head start \\nin buying microstartups as it did in search a few years ago. After all, Google Maps, the \\ncanonical Ajax application, was the result of a startup they bought.\\nSo ironically the original description of the Web 2.0 conference turned out to be partially right: \\nweb-based applications are a big component of Web 2.0. But I\\'m convinced they got this right \\nby accident. The Ajax boom didn\\'t start till early 2005, when Google Maps appeared and the \\nterm \"Ajax\" was coined.\\n2. Democracy\\nThe second big element of Web 2.0 is democracy. We now have several examples to prove that \\namateurs can surpass professionals, when they have the right kind of system to channel their \\nefforts. Wikipedia may be the most famous. Experts have given Wikipedia middling reviews, but \\nthey miss the critical point: it\\'s good enough. And it\\'s free, which means people actually read it. \\nOn ', '\\nefforts. Wikipedia may be the most famous. Experts have given Wikipedia middling reviews, but \\nthey miss the critical point: it\\'s good enough. And it\\'s free, which means people actually read it. \\nOn the web, articles you have to pay for might as well not exist. Even if you were willing to pay \\nto read them yourself, you can\\'t link to them. They\\'re not part of the conversation.\\nAnother place democracy seems to win is in deciding what counts as news. I never look at any \\nnews site now except Reddit. [2] I know if something major happens, or someone writes a \\nparticularly interesting article, it will show up there. Why bother checking the front page of any \\nspecific paper or magazine? Reddit\\'s like an RSS feed for the whole web, with a filter for quality. \\nSimilar sites include Digg, a technology news site that\\'s rapidly approaching Slashdot in \\npopularity, and del.icio.us, the collaborative bookmarking network that set off the \"tagging\" \\nmovement. And whereas Wikipedia\\'s main appeal is ', 'ology news site that\\'s rapidly approaching Slashdot in \\npopularity, and del.icio.us, the collaborative bookmarking network that set off the \"tagging\" \\nmovement. And whereas Wikipedia\\'s main appeal is that it\\'s good enough and free, these sites \\nsuggest that voters do a significantly better job than human editors.\\nThe most dramatic example of Web 2.0 democracy is not in the selection of ideas, but their \\nproduction. I\\'ve noticed for a while that the stuff I read on individual people\\'s sites is as good as \\nor better than the stuff I read in newspapers and magazines. And now I have independent \\nevidence: the top links on Reddit are generally links to individual people\\'s sites rather than to \\nmagazine articles or news stories.\\nMy experience of writing for magazines suggests an explanation. Editors. They control the \\ntopics you can write about, and they can generally rewrite whatever you produce. The result is \\nto damp extremes. Editing yields 95th percentile writing—95% of articles are imp', 'tors. They control the \\ntopics you can write about, and they can generally rewrite whatever you produce. The result is \\nto damp extremes. Editing yields 95th percentile writing—95% of articles are improved by it, but \\n5% are dragged down. 5% of the time you get \"throngs of geeks.\"\\nOn the web, people can publish whatever they want. Nearly all of it falls short of the editor-\\ndamped writing in print publications. But the pool of writers is very, very large. If it\\'s large \\nenough, the lack of damping means the best writing online should surpass the best in print. [3] \\nAnd now that the web has evolved mechanisms for selecting good stuff, the web wins net. \\nSelection beats damping, for the same reason market economies beat centrally planned ones.\\nEven the startups are different this time around.

They are to the startups of the Bubble what \\nbloggers are to the print media. During the Bubble, a startup meant a company headed by an \\nMBA that was blowing through several million dollars of VC money to \"get big fast\" in the most \\nliteral sense. Now it means a smaller, younger, more technical group that just decided to make \\nsomething great. They\\'ll decide later if they want to raise VC-scale funding, and if they take it, \\nthey\\'ll take it on their terms.\\n3. Don\\'t Maltreat Users\\nI think everyone would agree that democracy and Ajax are elements of \"Web 2.0.\" I also see a \\nthird: not to maltreat users. During the Bubble a lot of popular sites were quite high-handed with \\nusers. And not just in obvious ways, like making them register, or subjecting them to annoying \\nads. The very design of the average site in the late 90s was an abuse. Many of the most \\npopular sites were loaded with obtrusive branding that made them slow to load and sent the \\nuser the message: this is our site, not yo', \" the average site in the late 90s was an abuse. Many of the most \\npopular sites were loaded with obtrusive branding that made them slow to load and sent the \\nuser the message: this is our site, not yours. (There's a physical analog in the Intel and \\nMicrosoft stickers that come on some laptops.)\\nI think the root of the problem was that sites felt they were giving something away for free, and \\ntill recently a company giving anything away for free could be pretty high-handed about it. \\nSometimes it reached the point of economic sadism: site owners assumed that the more pain \\nthey caused the user, the more benefit it must be to them. The most dramatic remnant of this \\nmodel may be at salon.com, where you can read the beginning of a story, but to get the rest \\nyou have sit through a movie.\\nAt Y Combinator we advise all the startups we fund never to lord it over users.

What a bang that balloon is going to make when someone \\npops it by offering a free web-based alternative to MS Office. [5] Who will? Google? They seem \\nto be taking their time. I suspect the pin will be wielded by a couple of 20 year old hackers who \\nare too naive to be intimidated by the idea. (How hard can it be?)\\nThe Common Thread\\nAjax, democracy, and not dissing users. What do they all have in common? I didn\\'t realize they \\nhad anything in common till recently, which is one of the reasons I disliked the term \"Web 2.0\" \\nso much. It seemed that it was being used as a label for whatever happened to be new—that it \\ndidn\\'t predict anything.\\nBut there is a common thread.

It seemed that it was being used as a label for whatever happened to be new—that it \\ndidn\\'t predict anything.\\nBut there is a common thread. Web 2.0 means using the web the way it\\'s meant to be used. \\nThe \"trends\" we\\'re seeing now are simply the inherent nature of the web emerging from under \\nthe broken models that got imposed on it during the Bubble.\\nI realized this when I read an interview with Joe Kraus, the co-founder of Excite. [6] Excite really \\nnever got the business model right at all. We fell into the classic problem of how when a new \\nmedium comes out it adopts the practices, the content, the business models of the old medium\\n—which fails, and then the more appropriate models get figured out.

But the first time around it was co-opted by Sun, and we got Java applets.

Microsoft helped kill it, but it would have died anyway. \\nThere was no uptake among hackers.

When you find PR firms promoting something as the next \\ndevelopment platform, you can be sure it\\'s not.

Mikey likes it.\\nThere\\'s another thing all three components of Web 2.0 have in common. Here\\'s a clue. \\nSuppose you approached investors with the following idea for a Web 2.0 startup: Sites like \\ndel.icio.us and flickr allow users to \"tag\" content with descriptive tokens.

Many are underfunded. A few are overfunded, which is like trying \\nto start driving in third gear.\\nI think it would help founders to understand funding better—not just the mechanics of it, but \\nwhat investors are thinking. I was surprised recently when I realized that all the worst problems \\nwe faced in our startup were due not to competitors, but investors. Dealing with competitors \\nwas easy by comparison.\\nI don't mean to suggest that our investors were nothing but a drag on us. They were helpful in \\nnegotiating deals, for example.

And if trouble with investors is one of the biggest \\nthreats to a startup, managing them is one of the most important skills founders need to learn.\\nLet's start by talking about the five sources of startup funding. Then we'll trace the life of a \\nhypothetical (very fortunate) startup as it shifts gears through successive rounds.\\nFriends and Family\\nA lot of startups get their first funding from friends and family. Excite did, for example: after the \\nfounders graduated from college, they borrowed $15,000 from their parents to start a company. \\nWith the help of some part-time jobs they made it last 18 months.\\nIf your friends or family happen to be rich, the line blurs between them and angel investors. At \\nViaweb we got our first $10,000 of seed money from our friend Julian, but he was sufficiently \\nrich that \", 'your friends or family happen to be rich, the line blurs between them and angel investors. At \\nViaweb we got our first $10,000 of seed money from our friend Julian, but he was sufficiently \\nrich that it\\'s hard to say whether he should be classified as a friend or angel. He was also a \\nlawyer, which was great, because it meant we didn\\'t have to pay legal bills out of that initial \\nsmall sum.\\nThe advantage of raising money from friends and family is that they\\'re easy to find. You already \\nknow them. There are three main disadvantages: you mix together your business and personal \\nlife; they will probably not be as well connected as angels or venture firms; and they may not be \\naccredited investors, which could complicate your life later.\\nThe SEC defines an \"accredited investor\" as someone with over a million dollars in liquid assets \\nor an income of over $200,000 a year. The regulatory burden is much lower if a company\\'s \\nshareholders are all accredited investors. Once you take money from', \"h over a million dollars in liquid assets \\nor an income of over $200,000 a year. The regulatory burden is much lower if a company's \\nshareholders are all accredited investors. Once you take money from the general public you're \\nmore restricted in what you can do. [1]\\nA startup's life will be more complicated, legally, if any of the investors aren't accredited. In an \\nIPO, it might not merely add expense, but change the outcome. A lawyer I asked about it said: \\nWhen the company goes public, the SEC will carefully study all prior issuances of stock by the \\ncompany and demand that it take immediate action to cure any past violations of securities \\nlaws. Those remedial actions can delay, stall or even kill the IPO. Of course the odds of any \\ngiven startup doing an IPO are small. But not as small as they might seem. A lot of startups that \\nend up going public didn't seem likely to at first. (Who could have guessed that the company \\nWozniak and Jobs started in their spare time selling plans \", \"ll as they might seem. A lot of startups that \\nend up going public didn't seem likely to at first. (Who could have guessed that the company \\nWozniak and Jobs started in their spare time selling plans for microcomputers would yield one \\nof the biggest IPOs of the decade?) Much of the value of a startup consists of that tiny \\nprobability multiplied by the huge outcome.\\nIt wasn't because they weren't accredited investors that I didn't ask my parents for seed money, \\nthough. When we were starting Viaweb, I didn't know about the concept of an accredited \\ninvestor, and didn't stop to think about the value of investors' connections. The reason I didn't \\ntake money from my parents was that I didn't want them to lose it.\\nConsulting\\nAnother way to fund a startup is to get a job. The best sort of job is a consulting project in which \\nyou can build whatever software you wanted to sell as a startup. Then you can gradually \\ntransform yourself from a consulting company into a product company, and hav\", \" is a consulting project in which \\nyou can build whatever software you wanted to sell as a startup. Then you can gradually \\ntransform yourself from a consulting company into a product company, and have your clients \\npay your development expenses.\\nThis is a good plan for someone with kids, because it takes most of the risk out of starting a \\nstartup. There never has to be a time when you have no revenues. Risk and reward are usually \\nproportionate, however: you should expect a plan that cuts the risk of starting a startup also to \\ncut the average return. In this case, you trade decreased financial risk for increased risk that \\nyour company won't succeed as a startup.\\nBut isn't the consulting company itself a startup? No, not generally. A company has to be more \\nthan small and newly founded to be a startup. There are millions of small businesses in \\nAmerica, but only a few thousand are startups. To be a startup, a company has to be a product \\nbusiness, not a service business. By which I \", \"to be a startup. There are millions of small businesses in \\nAmerica, but only a few thousand are startups. To be a startup, a company has to be a product \\nbusiness, not a service business. By which I mean not that it has to make something physical, \\nbut that it has to have one thing it sells to many people, rather than doing custom work for \\nindividual clients. Custom work doesn't scale. To be a startup you need to be the band that sells \\na million copies of a song, not the band that makes money by playing at individual weddings \\nand bar mitzvahs.\\nThe trouble with consulting is that clients have an awkward habit of calling you on the phone. \\nMost startups operate close to the margin of failure, and the distraction of having to deal with \\nclients could be enough to put you over the edge. Especially if you have competitors who get to \\nwork full time on just being a startup.\\nSo you have to be very disciplined if you take the consulting route. You have to work actively to \\nprevent your com\", 'pecially if you have competitors who get to \\nwork full time on just being a startup.\\nSo you have to be very disciplined if you take the consulting route. You have to work actively to \\nprevent your company growing into a \"weed tree,\" dependent on this source of easy but low-\\nmargin money. [2]\\nIndeed, the biggest danger of consulting may be that it gives you an excuse for failure. In a \\nstartup, as in grad school, a lot of what ends up driving you are the expectations of your family \\nand friends. Once you start a startup and tell everyone that\\'s what you\\'re doing, you\\'re now on \\na path labelled \"get rich or bust.\" You now have to get rich, or you\\'ve failed.\\nFear of failure is an extraordinarily powerful force. Usually it prevents people from starting \\nthings, but once you publish some definite ambition, it switches directions and starts working in \\nyour favor.

I think it's a pretty clever piece of jiujitsu to set this irresistible force against the \\nslightly less immovable object of becoming rich. You won't have it driving you if your stated \\nambition is merely to start a consulting company that you will one day morph into a startup.\\nAn advantage of consulting, as a way to develop a product, is that you know you're making \\nsomething at least one customer wants. But if you have what it takes to start a startup you \\nshould have sufficient vision not to need this crutch.\\nAngel Investors\\nAngels are individual rich people. The word was first used for backers of Broadway plays, but \\nnow applies to individual investors generally. Angels who've made money in technology are \\npreferable, for two reasons: they understand your situation, and they're a source of contacts and \\nadvice.\\nThe contacts and advice can be more important than the money. When del.icio.us took money \\nfrom invest\", \"e, for two reasons: they understand your situation, and they're a source of contacts and \\nadvice.\\nThe contacts and advice can be more important than the money. When del.icio.us took money \\nfrom investors, they took money from, among others, Tim O'Reilly. The amount he put in was \\nsmall compared to the VCs who led the round, but Tim is a smart and influential guy and it's \\ngood to have him on your side.\\nYou can do whatever you want with money from consulting or friends and family. With angels \\nwe're now talking about venture funding proper, so it's time to introduce the concept of exit \\nstrategy. Younger would-be founders are often surprised that investors expect them either to sell \\nthe company or go public. The reason is that investors need to get their capital back. They'll \\nonly consider companies that have an exit strategy—meaning companies that could get bought \\nor go public.\\nThis is not as selfish as it sounds. There are few large, private technology companies. Those \\nthat don't \", 'r companies that have an exit strategy—meaning companies that could get bought \\nor go public.\\nThis is not as selfish as it sounds. There are few large, private technology companies. Those \\nthat don\\'t fail all seem to get bought or go public. The reason is that employees are investors too\\n—of their time—and they want just as much to be able to cash out. If your competitors offer \\nemployees stock options that might make them rich, while you make it clear you plan to stay \\nprivate, your competitors will get the best people. So the principle of an \"exit\" is not just \\nsomething forced on startups by investors, but part of what it means to be a startup.\\nAnother concept we need to introduce now is valuation. When someone buys shares in a \\ncompany, that implicitly establishes a value for it. If someone pays $20,000 for 10% of a \\ncompany, the company is in theory worth $200,000. I say \"in theory\" because in early stage \\ninvesting, valuations are voodoo.

I say \"in theory\" because in early stage \\ninvesting, valuations are voodoo. As a company gets more established, its valuation gets closer \\nto an actual market value. But in a newly founded startup, the valuation number is just an \\nartifact of the respective contributions of everyone involved.\\nStartups often \"pay\" investors who will help the company in some way by letting them invest at \\nlow valuations. If I had a startup and Steve Jobs wanted to invest in it, I\\'d give him the stock for \\n$10, just to be able to brag that he was an investor. Unfortunately, it\\'s impractical (if not illegal) \\nto adjust the valuation of the company up and down for each investor. Startups\\' valuations are \\nsupposed to rise over time. So if you\\'re going to sell cheap stock to eminent angels, do it early, \\nwhen it\\'s natural for the company to have a low valuation.\\nSome angel investors join together in syndicates.

You can find groups near you through the Angel Capital Association. [3] \\nHowever, most angel investors don't belong to these groups. In fact, the more prominent the \\nangel, the less likely they are to belong to a group.\\nSome angel groups charge you money to pitch your idea to them. Needless to say, you should \\nnever do this.\\nOne of the dangers of taking investment from individual angels, rather than through an angel \\ngroup or investment firm, is that they have less reputation to protect. A big-name VC firm will \\nnot screw you too outrageously, because other founders would avoid them if word got out.

When we got into such a \\nscrape, our investors took advantage of it in a way that a name-brand VC probably wouldn't \\nhave.\\nAngels have a corresponding advantage, however: they're also not bound by all the rules that \\nVC firms are. And so they can, for example, allow founders to cash out partially in a funding \\nround, by selling some of their stock directly to the investors.

(As in families, relations between founders and investors can be complicated.)\\nThe best way to find angel investors is through personal introductions. You could try to cold-call \\nangel groups near you, but angels, like VCs, will pay more attention to deals recommended by \\nsomeone they respect.\\nDeal terms with angels vary a lot. There are no generally accepted standards. Sometimes \\nangels' deal terms are as fearsome as VCs'.

Which \\nin practice usually means, whatever existing agreement he finds lying around his firm. (Few \\nlegal documents are created from scratch.)\\nThese heaps o' boilerplate are a problem for small startups, because they tend to grow into the \\nunion of all preceding documents.

Some angels might balk at this, but others would probably welcome it.\\nInexperienced angels often get cold feet when the time comes to write that big check. In our \\nstartup, one of the two angels in the initial round took months to pay us, and only did after \\nrepeated nagging from our lawyer, who was also, fortunately, his lawyer.\\nIt's obvious why investors delay.

[4]\\nSeed Funding Firms\\nSeed firms are like angels in that they invest relatively small amounts at early stages, but like \\nVCs in that they\\'re companies that do it as a business, rather than individuals making \\noccasional investments on the side.\\nTill now, nearly all seed firms have been so-called \"incubators,\" so Y Combinator gets called \\none too, though the only thing we have in common is that we invest in the earliest phase.\\nAccording to the National Association of Business Incubators, there are about 800 incubators in \\nthe US.

At one extreme is the sort of pork-barrel project where a town gets money from \\nthe state government to renovate a vacant building as a \"high-tech incubator,\" as if it were \\nmerely lack of the right sort of office space that had till now prevented the town from becoming \\na startup hub.

In addition to working in their \\nspace, you were supposed to use their office staff, lawyers, accountants, and so on.\\nWhereas incubators tend (or tended) to exert more control than VCs, Y Combinator exerts less. \\nAnd we think it\\'s better if startups operate out of their own premises, however crappy, than the \\noffices of their investors. So it\\'s annoying that we keep getting called an \"incubator,\" but \\nperhaps inevitable, because there\\'s only one of us so far and no word yet for what we are. If we \\nhave to be called something, the obvious name would be \"excubator.\" (The name is more \\nexcusable if one considers it as meaning that we enable people to escape cubicles.)\\nBecause seed firms are companies rather than individual people, reaching them is easier than', 'or.\" (The name is more \\nexcusable if one considers it as meaning that we enable people to escape cubicles.)\\nBecause seed firms are companies rather than individual people, reaching them is easier than \\nreaching angels. Just go to their web site and send them an email. The importance of personal \\nintroductions varies, but is less than with angels or VCs.\\nThe fact that seed firms are companies also means the investment process is more \\nstandardized. (This is generally true with angel groups too.) Seed firms will probably have set \\ndeal terms they use for every startup they fund. The fact that the deal terms are standard \\ndoesn\\'t mean they\\'re favorable to you, but if other startups have signed the same agreements \\nand things went well for them, it\\'s a sign the terms are reasonable.\\nSeed firms differ from angels and VCs in that they invest exclusively in the earliest phases—\\noften when the company is still just an idea.

For example, in the first couple months a startup \\nmay completely redefine their idea. So seed investors usually care less about the idea than the \\npeople. This is true of all venture funding, but especially so in the seed stage.\\nLike VCs, one of the advantages of seed firms is the advice they offer. But because seed firms \\noperate in an earlier phase, they need to offer different kinds of advice. For example, a seed \\nfirm should be able to give advice about how to approach VCs, which VCs obviously don\\'t need \\nto do; whereas VCs should be able to give advice about how to hire an \"executive team,\" which \\nis not an issue in the seed stage.\\nIn the earliest phases, a lot of the problems are technical, so seed firms should be able ', 'hould be able to give advice about how to hire an \"executive team,\" which \\nis not an issue in the seed stage.\\nIn the earliest phases, a lot of the problems are technical, so seed firms should be able to help \\nwith technical as well as business problems.\\nSeed firms and angel investors generally want to invest in the initial phases of a startup, then \\nhand them off to VC firms for the next round. Occasionally startups go from seed funding direct \\nto acquisition, however, and I expect this to become increasingly common.\\nGoogle has been aggressively pursuing this route, and now Yahoo is too. Both now compete \\ndirectly with VCs. And this is a smart move. Why wait for further funding rounds to jack up a \\nstartup\\'s price? When a startup reaches the point where VCs have enough information to invest \\nin it, the acquirer should have enough information to buy it. More information, in fact; with their \\ntechnical depth, the acquirers should be better at picking winners than VCs.\\nVenture Capital Fun', 't \\nin it, the acquirer should have enough information to buy it.

VC investments average several million dollars. So they \\ntend to come later in the life of a startup, are harder to get, and come with tougher terms.\\nThe word \"venture capitalist\" is sometimes used loosely for any venture investor, but there is a \\nsharp difference between VCs and other investors: VC firms are organized as funds, much like \\nhedge funds or mutual funds. The fund managers, who are called \"general partners,\" get about \\n2% of the fund annually as a management fee, plus about 20% of the fund\\'s gains.\\nThere is a very sharp dropoff in performance among VC firms, because in the VC business \\nboth success and failure are self-perpetuating.

And many \\nfounders prefer to take money from successful VC firms, because of the legitimacy it confers. \\nHence a vicious (for the losers) cycle: VC firms that have been doing badly will only get the \\ndeals the bigger fish have rejected, causing them to continue to do badly.\\nAs a result, of the thousand or so VC funds in the US now, only about 50 are likely to make \\nmoney, and it is very hard for a new fund to break into this group.\\nIn a sense, the lower-tier VC firms are a bargain for founders.

The most obvious is valuation: they\\'ll take less of your company. But as well as \\nmoney, there\\'s power. I think founders will increasingly be able to stay on as CEO, and on terms \\nthat will make it fairly hard to fire them later.\\nThe most dramatic change, I predict, is that VCs will allow founders to cash out partially by \\nselling some of their stock direct to the VC firm. VCs have traditionally resisted letting founders \\nget anything before the ultimate \"liquidity event.\" But they\\'re also desperate for deals. And since \\nI know from my own experience that the rule against buying stock from founders is a stupid \\none, this is a natural place for things to give as venture funding becomes more and more a \\nseller\\'s market.\\nThe disadvantage of taking money from less known firms is that ', \" from founders is a stupid \\none, this is a natural place for things to give as venture funding becomes more and more a \\nseller's market.\\nThe disadvantage of taking money from less known firms is that people will assume, correctly \\nor not, that you were turned down by the more exalted ones. But, like where you went to \\ncollege, the name of your VC stops mattering once you have some performance to measure. \\nSo the more confident you are, the less you need a brand-name VC. We funded Viaweb entirely \\nwith angel money; it never occurred to us that the backing of a well known VC firm would make \\nus seem more impressive. [5]\\nAnother danger of less known firms is that, like angels, they have less reputation to protect. I \\nsuspect it's the lower-tier firms that are responsible for most of the tricks that have given VCs \\nsuch a bad reputation among hackers.

One experienced CFO said: The better \\nones usually will not give a term sheet unless they really want to do a deal. The second or third \\ntier firms have a much higher break rate—it could be as high as 50%.

Here's a partial solution: when \\na VC offers you a term sheet, ask how many of their last 10 term sheets turned into deals. This \\nwill at least force them to lie outright if they want to mislead you.\\nNot all the people who work at VC firms are partners. Most firms also have a handful of junior \\nemployees called something like associates or analysts. If you get a call from a VC firm, go to \\ntheir web site and check whether the person you talked to is a partner.

Don't be misled by this optimism. It's the partners who decide, and \\nthey view things with a colder eye.\\nBecause VCs invest large amounts, the money comes with more restrictions. Most only come \\ninto effect if the company gets into trouble. For example, VCs generally write it into the deal that \\nin any sale, they get their investment back first. So if the company gets sold at a low price, the \\nfounders could get nothing.

VCs don\\'t want to \\ninvest millions in a company the founders could just walk away from. Financially, vesting has \\nlittle effect, but in some situations it could mean founders will have less power. If VCs got de \\nfacto control of the company and fired one of the founders, he\\'d lose any unvested stock unless \\nthere was specific protection against this. So vesting would in that situation force founders to \\ntoe the line.\\nThe most noticeable change when a startup takes serious funding is that the founders will no \\nlonger have complete control.

The danger comes when there\\'s a bump in the road, as happened to \\nSteve Jobs at Apple.\\nLike angels, VCs prefer to invest in deals that come to them through people they know.

As one VC put it: I\\'m not hard to find. I know a lot of \\npeople. If you can\\'t find some way to reach me, how are you going to create a successful \\ncompany? One of the most difficult problems for startup founders is deciding when to approach \\nVCs. You really only get one chance, because they rely heavily on first impressions. And you \\ncan\\'t approach some and save others for later, because (a) they ask who else you\\'ve talked to \\nand when and (b) they talk among themselves.

This is actually less common than it seems: many have to claim they thought of the idea \\nafter quitting because otherwise their former employer would own it.\\nThe three friends decide to take the leap. Since most startups are in competitive businesses, \\nyou not only want to work full-time on them, but more than full-time. So some or all of the \\nfriends quit their jobs or leave school.

They find some just as the prototype is demoable. When they demo it, one of \\nthe angels is willing to invest.

Now the group is looking for more money: they want enough to \\nlast for a year, and maybe to hire a couple friends. So they're going to raise $200,000.\\nThe angel agrees to invest at a pre-money valuation of $1 million. The company issues \\n$200,000 worth of new shares to the angel; if there were 1000 shares before the deal, this \\nmeans 200 additional shares. The angel now owns 200/1200 shares, or a sixth of the company, \\nand all the previous shareholders' percentage ownership is diluted by a sixth.

The startup, remember, only has a couple thousand left. \\nIn practice this turns out to be a sticky problem that usually gets solved in some improvised way. \\nMaybe the startup can find lawyers who will do it cheaply in the hope of future work if the \\nstartup succeeds. Maybe someone has a lawyer friend. Maybe the angel pays for his lawyer to \\nrepresent both sides. (Make sure if you take the latter route that the lawyer is representing you \\nrather than merely advising you, or his only duty is to the investor.)\\nAn angel investing $200k would probably expect a seat on the board of directors.

Typically these rights include vetoes over major strategic \\ndecisions, protection against being diluted in future rounds, and the right to get one's \\ninvestment back first if the company is sold.\\nSome investors might expect the founders to accept vesting for a sum this size, and others \\nwouldn't. VCs are more likely to require vesting than angels. At Viaweb we managed to raise \\n$2.5 million from angels without ever accepting vesting, largely because we were so \\ninexperienced that we were appalled at the idea.

But maybe if we \\nwere investing millions we would think differently.\\nI should add that vesting is also a way for founders to protect themselves against one another. It \\nsolves the problem of what to do if one of the founders quits.

Perhaps they need to \\nspend a lot on marketing, or build some kind of expensive infrastructure, or hire highly paid \\nsalesmen. So they decide to start talking to VCs.

They find the VCs intimidating \\nand inscrutable. They all ask the same question: who else have you pitched to? (VCs are like \\nhigh school girls: they\\'re acutely aware of their position in the VC pecking order, and their \\ninterest in a company is a function of the interest other VCs show in it.)\\nOne of the VC firms says they want to invest and offers the founders a term sheet. A term sheet \\nis a summary of what the deal terms will be when and if they do a deal; lawyers will fill in the \\ndetails later. By accepting the term sheet, the startup agrees to turn away other VCs for some \\nset amount of time while this firm does the \"due diligence\" required for the deal.

In the real world, VCs regard angels \\nthe way a jealous husband feels about his wife's previous boyfriends. To them the company \\ndidn't exist before they invested in it.

[10] The startup will almost certainly hire more people at this point; those millions must be \\nput to work, after all. The company may do additional funding rounds, presumably at higher \\nvaluations. They may if they are extraordinarily fortunate do an IPO, which we should remember \\nis also in principle a round of funding, regardless of its de facto purpose.

Many startups—even successful ones—come close to \\nrunning out of money at some point. Terrible things happen to startups when they run out of \\nmoney, because they're designed for growth, not adversity.\\nBut the most unrealistic thing about the series of deals I've described is that they all closed.

The reason is that \\nit's such a risky environment. People about to fund or acquire a startup are prone to wicked \\ncases of buyer's remorse. They don't really grasp the risk they're taking till the deal's about to \\nclose. And then they panic. And not just inexperienced angel investors, but big companies too.\\nSo if you're a startup founder wondering why some angel investor isn't returning your phone \\ncalls, you can at least take comfort in the thought that the same thing is happening to other \\ndeals a hundred times the size.\\nThe example of a startup's history that I'\", \"or isn't returning your phone \\ncalls, you can at least take comfort in the thought that the same thing is happening to other \\ndeals a hundred times the size.\\nThe example of a startup's history that I've presented is like a skeleton—accurate so far as it \\ngoes, but needing to be fleshed out to be a complete picture.

The very uncertainty of \\nstartups frightens away almost everyone. People overvalue stability—especially young people, \\nwho ironically need it least.

Governments may mean well when they set up grant programs to encourage startups, but what they give \\nwith one hand they take away with the other: the process of applying is inevitably so arduous, and the restrictions on \\nwhat you can do with the money so burdensome, that it would be easier to take a job to get the\", \"they take away with the other: the process of applying is inevitably so arduous, and the restrictions on \\nwhat you can do with the money so burdensome, that it would be easier to take a job to get the money.\\nYou should be especially suspicious of grants whose purpose is some kind of social engineering-- e.g. to encourage \\nmore startups to be started in Mississippi.

Down rounds are bad news; it is generally the common stock holders who take the hit. Some of the \\nmost fearsome provisions in VC deal terms have to do with down rounds—like \"full ratchet anti-dilution,\" which is as \\nfrightening as it sounds.\\nFounders are tempted to ignore these clauses, because they think the company will either be a big success or a \\ncomplete bust.

This by itself is not the end of the world. In fact, it's \\njust a more extreme version of the norm in the VC business: too much money chasing too few \\ndeals.\\nUnfortunately, those few deals now want less and less money, because it's getting so cheap to \\nstart a startup.

The four causes: open source, which makes software free; Moore's law, which \\nmakes hardware geometrically closer to free; the Web, which makes promotion free if you're \\ngood; and better languages, which make development a lot cheaper.\\nWhen we started our startup in 1995, the first three were our biggest expenses. We had to pay \\n$5000 for the Netscape Commerce Server, the only software that then supported secure http \\nconnections. We paid $3000 for a server with a 90 MHz processor and 32 meg of memory. And \\nwe paid a PR firm about $30,000 to promote our launch.\\nNow you could get all three for nothing.

At most startups ten years ago, software \\ndevelopment meant ten programmers writing code in C++. Now the same work might be done \\nby one or two using Python or Ruby.\\nDuring the Bubble, a lot of people predicted that startups would outsource their development to \\nIndia. I think a better model for the future is David Heinemeier Hansson, who outsourced his \\ndevelopment to a more powerful language instead. A lot of well-known applications are now, like \\nBaseCamp, written by just one programmer.

VCs like to invest several million at a time. But as one VC \\ntold me after a startup he funded would only take about half a million, \"I don\\'t know what we\\'re \\ngoing to do. Maybe we\\'ll just have to give some of it back.\" Meaning give some of the fund back \\nto the institutional investors who supplied it, because it wasn\\'t going to be possible to invest it all.\\nInto this already bad situation comes the third problem: Sarbanes-Oxley.

And in addition to the cost of compliance, which is at least two million dollars a \\nyear, the law introduces frightening legal exposure for corporate officers.

This CFO is both the smartest and the most upstanding money guy I know. If Sarbanes-\\nOxley deters people like him from being CFOs of public companies, that\\'s proof enough that it\\'s \\nbroken.\\nLargely because of Sarbanes-Oxley, few startups go public now.

They didn\\'t mean to be in this business; it\\'s just what their business has evolved into.\\nHence the fourth problem: the acquirers have begun to realize they can buy wholesale. Why \\nshould they wait for VCs to make the startups they want more expensive? Most of what the VCs \\nadd, acquirers don\\'t want anyway. The acquirers already have brand recognition and HR \\ndepartments.

Get funded by Y Combinator. \\n October 2005\\n(This essay is derived from a talk at the 2005 Startup School.)\\nHow do you get good ideas for startups? That's probably the number one question people ask \\nme.\\nI'd like to reply with another question: why do people think it's hard to come up with ideas for \\nstartups?\\nThat might seem a stupid thing \", \"ups? That's probably the number one question people ask \\nme.\\nI'd like to reply with another question: why do people think it's hard to come up with ideas for \\nstartups?\\nThat might seem a stupid thing to ask. Why do they think it's hard? If people can't do it, then it is \\nhard, at least for them. Right?\\nWell, maybe not. What people usually say is not that they can't think of ideas, but that they don't \\nhave any. That's not quite the same thing. It could be the reason they don't have any is that they \\nhaven't tried to generate them.\\nI think this is often the case. I think people believe that coming up with ideas for startups is very \\nhard-- that it must be very hard-- and so they don't try do to it. They assume ideas are like \\nmiracles: they either pop into your head or they don't.\\nI also have a theory about why people think this. They overvalue ideas. They think creating a \\nstartup is just a matter of implementing some fabulous initial idea. And since a successful \\nstartup is worth mill\", \"ve a theory about why people think this. They overvalue ideas. They think creating a \\nstartup is just a matter of implementing some fabulous initial idea. And since a successful \\nstartup is worth millions of dollars, a good idea is therefore a million dollar idea.\\nIf coming up with an idea for a startup equals coming up with a million dollar idea, then of \\ncourse it's going to seem hard. Too hard to bother trying. Our instincts tell us something so \\nvaluable would not be just lying around for anyone to discover.\\nActually, startup ideas are not million dollar ideas, and here's an experiment you can try to \\nprove it: just try to sell one. Nothing evolves faster than markets. The fact that there's no market \\nfor startup ideas suggests there's no demand. Which means, in the narrow sense of the word, \\nthat startup ideas are worthless.\\nQuestions\\nThe fact is, most startups end up nothing like the initial idea. It would be closer to the truth to \\nsay the main value of your initial idea is that\", \" word, \\nthat startup ideas are worthless.\\nQuestions\\nThe fact is, most startups end up nothing like the initial idea. It would be closer to the truth to \\nsay the main value of your initial idea is that, in the process of discovering it's broken, you'll \\ncome up with your real idea.\\nThe initial idea is just a starting point-- not a blueprint, but a question. It might help if they were \\nexpressed that way. Instead of saying that your idea is to make a collaborative, web-based \\nspreadsheet, say: could one make a collaborative, web-based spreadsheet? A few grammatical \\ntweaks, and a woefully incomplete idea becomes a promising question to explore.\\nThere's a real difference, because an assertion provokes objections in a way a question \\ndoesn't. If you say: I'm going to build a web-based spreadsheet, then critics-- the most \\ndangerous of which are in your own head-- will immediately reply that you'd be competing with \\nMicrosoft, that you couldn't give people the kind of UI they expect, that u\", \"eet, then critics-- the most \\ndangerous of which are in your own head-- will immediately reply that you'd be competing with \\nMicrosoft, that you couldn't give people the kind of UI they expect, that users wouldn't want to \\nhave their data on your servers, and so on.\\nA question doesn't seem so challenging. It becomes: let's try making a web-based spreadsheet \\nand see how far we get. And everyone knows that if you tried this you'd be able to make \\nsomething useful. Maybe what you'd end up with wouldn't even be a spreadsheet. Maybe it \\nwould be some kind of new spreasheet-like collaboration tool that doesn't even have a name \\nyet. You wouldn't have thought of something like that except by implementing your way toward it.\\nTreating a startup idea as a question changes what you're looking for. If an idea is a blueprint, it \\nhas to be right. But if it's a question, it can be wrong, so long as it's wrong in a way that leads to \\nmore ideas.\\nOne valuable way for an idea to be wrong is to be only\", \"f an idea is a blueprint, it \\nhas to be right. But if it's a question, it can be wrong, so long as it's wrong in a way that leads to \\nmore ideas.\\nOne valuable way for an idea to be wrong is to be only a partial solution. When someone's \\nworking on a problem that seems too big, I always ask: is there some way to bite off some \\nsubset of the problem, then gradually expand from there? That will generally work unless you \\nget trapped on a local maximum, like 1980s-style AI, or C.\\nUpwind\\nSo far, we've reduced the problem from thinking of a million dollar idea to thinking of a mistaken \\nquestion. That doesn't seem so hard, does it?\\nTo generate such questions you need two things: to be familiar with promising new \\ntechnologies, and to have the right kind of friends. New technologies are the ingredients startup \\nideas are made of, and conversations with friends are the kitchen they're cooked in.\\nUniversities have both, and that's why so many startups grow out of them. They're filled with \\nnew \", \"dients startup \\nideas are made of, and conversations with friends are the kitchen they're cooked in.\\nUniversities have both, and that's why so many startups grow out of them. They're filled with \\nnew technologies, because they're trying to produce research, and only things that are new \\ncount as research. And they're full of exactly the right kind of people to have ideas with: the \\nother students, who will be not only smart but elastic-minded to a fault.\\nThe opposite extreme would be a well-paying but boring job at a big company. Big companies \\nare biased against new technologies, and the people you'd meet there would be wrong too.\\nIn an essay I wrote for high school students, I said a good rule of thumb was to stay upwind-- to \\nwork on things that maximize your future options. The principle applies for adults too, though \\nperhaps it has to be modified to: stay upwind for as long as you can, then cash in the potential \\nenergy you've accumulated when you need to pay for kids.\\nI don't th\", 'le applies for adults too, though \\nperhaps it has to be modified to: stay upwind for as long as you can, then cash in the potential \\nenergy you\\'ve accumulated when you need to pay for kids.\\nI don\\'t think people consciously realize this, but one reason downwind jobs like churning out \\nJava for a bank pay so well is precisely that they are downwind. The market price for that kind \\nof work is higher because it gives you fewer options for the future. A job that lets you work on \\nexciting new stuff will tend to pay less, because part of the compensation is in the form of the \\nnew skills you\\'ll learn.\\nGrad school is the other end of the spectrum from a coding job at a big company: the pay\\'s low \\nbut you spend most of your time working on new stuff. And of course, it\\'s called \"school,\" which \\nmakes that clear to everyone, though in fact all jobs are some percentage school.\\nThe right environment for having startup ideas need not be a university per se. It just has to be \\na situation with a lar', \"es that clear to everyone, though in fact all jobs are some percentage school.\\nThe right environment for having startup ideas need not be a university per se. It just has to be \\na situation with a large percentage of school.\\nIt's obvious why you want exposure to new technology, but why do you need other people? \\nCan't you just think of new ideas yourself? The empirical answer is: no. Even Einstein needed \\npeople to bounce ideas off. Ideas get developed in the process of explaining them to the right \\nkind of person. You need that resistance, just as a carver needs the resistance of the wood.\\nThis is one reason Y Combinator has a rule against investing in startups with only one founder. \\nPractically every successful company has at least two. And because startup founders work \\nunder great pressure, it's critical they be friends.\\nI didn't realize it till I was writing this, but that may help explain why there are so few female \\nstartup founders. I read on the Internet (so it must be true) \", \"ssure, it's critical they be friends.\\nI didn't realize it till I was writing this, but that may help explain why there are so few female \\nstartup founders. I read on the Internet (so it must be true) that only 1.7% of VC-backed \\nstartups are founded by women. The percentage of female hackers is small, but not that small. \\nSo why the discrepancy?\\nWhen you realize that successful startups tend to have multiple founders who were already \\nfriends, a possible explanation emerges. People's best friends are likely to be of the same sex, \\nand if one group is a minority in some population, pairs of them will be a minority squared. [1]\\nDoodling\\nWhat these groups of co-founders do together is more complicated than just sitting down and \\ntrying to think of ideas. I suspect the most productive setup is a kind of together-alone-together \\nsandwich. Together you talk about some hard problem, probably getting nowhere. Then, the \\nnext morning, one of you has an idea in the shower about how to solve it. \", \" a kind of together-alone-together \\nsandwich. Together you talk about some hard problem, probably getting nowhere. Then, the \\nnext morning, one of you has an idea in the shower about how to solve it. He runs eagerly to to \\ntell the others, and together they work out the kinks.\\nWhat happens in that shower? It seems to me that ideas just pop into my head. But can we say \\nmore than that?\\nTaking a shower is like a form of meditation. You're alert, but there's nothing to distract you. It's \\nin a situation like this, where your mind is free to roam, that it bumps into new ideas.\\nWhat happens when your mind wanders? It may be like doodling. Most people have \\ncharacteristic ways of doodling. This habit is unconscious, but not random: I found my doodles \\nchanged after I started studying painting. I started to make the kind of gestures I'd make if I \\nwere drawing from life. They were atoms of drawing, but arranged randomly. [2]\\nPerhaps letting your mind wander is like doodling with ideas. You ha\", ' started to make the kind of gestures I\\'d make if I \\nwere drawing from life. They were atoms of drawing, but arranged randomly. [2]\\nPerhaps letting your mind wander is like doodling with ideas. You have certain mental gestures \\nyou\\'ve learned in your work, and when you\\'re not paying attention, you keep making these \\nsame gestures, but somewhat randomly. In effect, you call the same functions on random \\narguments. That\\'s what a metaphor is: a function applied to an argument of the wrong type.\\nConveniently, as I was writing this, my mind wandered: would it be useful to have metaphors in \\na programming language? I don\\'t know; I don\\'t have time to think about this. But it\\'s convenient \\nbecause this is an example of what I mean by habits of mind. I spend a lot of time thinking \\nabout language design, and my habit of always asking \"would x be useful in a programming \\nlanguage\" just got invoked.\\nIf new ideas arise like doodles, this would explain why you have to work at something for a \\nwhile', 'esign, and my habit of always asking \"would x be useful in a programming \\nlanguage\" just got invoked.\\nIf new ideas arise like doodles, this would explain why you have to work at something for a \\nwhile before you have any. It\\'s not just that you can\\'t judge ideas till you\\'re an expert in a field. \\nYou won\\'t even generate ideas, because you won\\'t have any habits of mind to invoke.\\nOf course the habits of mind you invoke on some field don\\'t have to be derived from working in \\nthat field. In fact, it\\'s often better if they\\'re not. You\\'re not just looking for good ideas, but for \\ngood new ideas, and you have a better chance of generating those if you combine stuff from \\ndistant fields. As hackers, one of our habits of mind is to ask, could one open-source x? For \\nexample, what if you made an open-source operating system? A fine idea, but not very novel. \\nWhereas if you ask, could you make an open-source play? you might be onto something.\\nAre some kinds of work better sources of habits of mi', \"en-source operating system? A fine idea, but not very novel. \\nWhereas if you ask, could you make an open-source play? you might be onto something.\\nAre some kinds of work better sources of habits of mind than others? I suspect harder fields \\nmay be better sources, because to attack hard problems you need powerful solvents. I find \\nmath is a good source of metaphors-- good enough that it's worth studying just for that. Related \\nfields are also good sources, especially when they're related in unexpected ways. Everyone \\nknows computer science and electrical engineering are related, but precisely because everyone \\nknows it, importing ideas from one to the other doesn't yield great profits. It's like importing \\nsomething from Wisconsin to Michigan. Whereas (I claim) hacking and painting are also \\nrelated, in the sense that hackers and painters are both makers, and this source of new ideas is \\npractically virgin territory.\\nProblems\\nIn theory you could stick together ideas at random and see wh\", \" \\nrelated, in the sense that hackers and painters are both makers, and this source of new ideas is \\npractically virgin territory.\\nProblems\\nIn theory you could stick together ideas at random and see what you came up with. What if you \\nbuilt a peer-to-peer dating site? Would it be useful to have an automatic book? Could you turn \\ntheorems into a commodity? When you assemble ideas at random like this, they may not be \\njust stupid, but semantically ill-formed. What would it even mean to make theorems a \\ncommodity? You got me. I didn't think of that idea, just its name.\\nYou might come up with something useful this way, but I never have. It's like knowing a fabulous \\nsculpture is hidden inside a block of marble, and all you have to do is remove the marble that \\nisn't part of it. It's an encouraging thought, because it reminds you there is an answer, but it's \\nnot much use in practice because the search space is too big.\\nI find that to have good ideas I need to be working on some problem. You\", \"ing thought, because it reminds you there is an answer, but it's \\nnot much use in practice because the search space is too big.\\nI find that to have good ideas I need to be working on some problem. You can't start with \\nrandomness. You have to start with a problem, then let your mind wander just far enough for \\nnew ideas to form.\\nIn a way, it's harder to see problems than their solutions. Most people prefer to remain in denial \\nabout problems. It's obvious why: problems are irritating. They're problems! Imagine if people in \\n1700 saw their lives the way we'd see them. It would have been unbearable. This denial is such \\na powerful force that, even when presented with possible solutions, people often prefer to \\nbelieve they wouldn't work.\\nI saw this phenomenon when I worked on spam filters. In 2002, most people preferred to ignore \\nspam, and most of those who didn't preferred to believe the heuristic filters then available were \\nthe best you could do.\\nI found spam intolerable, and I felt \", \"n 2002, most people preferred to ignore \\nspam, and most of those who didn't preferred to believe the heuristic filters then available were \\nthe best you could do.\\nI found spam intolerable, and I felt it had to be possible to recognize it statistically. And it turns \\nout that was all you needed to solve the problem. The algorithm I used was ridiculously simple. \\nAnyone who'd really tried to solve the problem would have found it. It was just that no one had \\nreally tried to solve the problem. [3]\\nLet me repeat that recipe: finding the problem intolerable and feeling it must be possible to \\nsolve it. Simple as it seems, that's the recipe for a lot of startup ideas.\\nWealth\\nSo far most of what I've said applies to ideas in general. What's special about startup ideas? \\nStartup ideas are ideas for companies, and companies have to make money. And the way to \\nmake money is to make something people want.\\nWealth is what people want. I don't mean that as some kind of philosophical statement; I mea\", \"r companies, and companies have to make money. And the way to \\nmake money is to make something people want.\\nWealth is what people want. I don't mean that as some kind of philosophical statement; I mean \\nit as a tautology.\\nSo an idea for a startup is an idea for something people want. Wouldn't any good idea be \\nsomething people want? Unfortunately not. I think new theorems are a fine thing to create, but \\nthere is no great demand for them. Whereas there appears to be great demand for celebrity \\ngossip magazines. Wealth is defined democratically. Good ideas and valuable ideas are not \\nquite the same thing; the difference is individual tastes.\\nBut valuable ideas are very close to good ideas, especially in technology. I think they're so close \\nthat you can get away with working as if the goal were to discover good ideas, so long as, in the \\nfinal stage, you stop and ask: will people actually pay for this? Only a few ideas are likely to \\nmake it that far and then get shot down; RPN calculat\", \"were to discover good ideas, so long as, in the \\nfinal stage, you stop and ask: will people actually pay for this? Only a few ideas are likely to \\nmake it that far and then get shot down; RPN calculators might be one example.\\nOne way to make something people want is to look at stuff people use now that's broken. \\nDating sites are a prime example. They have millions of users, so they must be promising \\nsomething people want. And yet they work horribly. Just ask anyone who uses them. It's as if \\nthey used the worse-is-better approach but stopped after the first stage and handed the thing \\nover to marketers.\\nOf course, the most obvious breakage in the average computer user's life is Windows itself. But \\nthis is a special case: you can't defeat a monopoly by a frontal attack. Windows can and will be \\noverthrown, but not by giving people a better desktop OS. The way to kill it is to redefine the \\nproblem as a superset of the current one.

The way to kill it is to redefine the \\nproblem as a superset of the current one. The problem is not, what operating system should \\npeople use on desktop computers? but how should people use applications? There are \\nanswers to that question that don't even involve desktop computers.\\nEveryone thinks Google is going to solve this problem, but it is a very subtle one, so subtle that \\na company as big as Google might well get it wrong. I think the odds are better than 50-50 that \\nthe Windows killer-- or more accurately, Windows transcender-- will come from some little \\nstartup.\\nAnother classic way to make something people want is to take a luxury and make it into a \\ncommmodity. People must want something if they pay a lot for it. And it is a very rare product \\nthat can't be made dramatically cheaper if you try.\\nThis was Henry Ford's plan. He made cars, which had been a luxury item, into a commodity. \\nBut the idea is much olde\", \" And it is a very rare product \\nthat can't be made dramatically cheaper if you try.\\nThis was Henry Ford's plan. He made cars, which had been a luxury item, into a commodity. \\nBut the idea is much older than Henry Ford. Water mills transformed mechanical power from a \\nluxury into a commodity, and they were used in the Roman empire. Arguably pastoralism \\ntransformed a luxury into a commodity.\\nWhen you make something cheaper you can sell more of them. But if you make something \\ndramatically cheaper you often get qualitative changes, because people start to use it in \\ndifferent ways. For example, once computers get so cheap that most people can have one of \\ntheir own, you can use them as communication devices.\\nOften to make something dramatically cheaper you have to redefine the problem. The Model T \\ndidn't have all the features previous cars did. It only came in black, for example.

It only came in black, for example. But it solved the \\nproblem people cared most about, which was getting from place to place.\\nOne of the most useful mental habits I know I learned from Michael Rabin: that the best way to \\nsolve a problem is often to redefine it. A lot of people use this technique without being \\nconsciously aware of it, but Rabin was spectacularly explicit. You need a big prime number? \\nThose are pretty expensive. How about if I give you a big number that only has a 10 to the \\nminus 100 chance of not being prime? Would that do? Well, probably; I mean, that's probably \\nsmaller than the chance that I'm imagining all this anyway.\\nRedefining the problem is a particularly juicy heuristic when you have competitors, because it's \\nso hard for rigid-minded people to follow. You can work in plain sight and they don't realize the \\ndanger. Don't worry about us. We're just working on search.

We're just working on search. Do one thing and do it well, that's \\nour motto.\\nMaking things cheaper is actually a subset of a more general technique: making things easier. \\nFor a long time it was most of making things easier, but now that the things we build are so \\ncomplicated, there's another rapidly growing subset: making things easier to use.\\nThis is an area where there's great room for improvement. What you want to be able to say \\nabout technology is: it just works. How often do you say that now?\\nSimplicity takes effort-- genius, even. The average programmer seems to produce UI designs \\nthat are almost willfully bad. I was trying to use the stove at my mother's house a couple weeks \\nago. It was a new one, and instead of physical knobs it had buttons and an LED display. I tried \\npressing some buttons I thought would cause it to get hot, and you know\", ' mother\\'s house a couple weeks \\nago.

I tried \\npressing some buttons I thought would cause it to get hot, and you know what it said? \"Err.\" Not \\neven \"Error.\" \"Err.\" You can\\'t just say \"Err\" to the user of a stove. You should design the UI so \\nthat errors are impossible. And the boneheads who designed this stove even had an example of \\nsuch a UI to work from: the old one. You turn one knob to set the temperature and another to \\nset the timer. What was wrong with that? It just worked.\\nIt seems that, for the average engineer, more options just means more rope to hang yourself. \\nSo if you want to start a startup, you can take almost any existing technology produced by a big \\ncompany, and assume you could build something way easier to use.\\nDesign for Exit\\nSuccess for a startup approximately equals getting bought.

You need some kind of exit strategy, \\nbecause you can't get the smartest people to work for you without giving them options likely to \\nbe worth something. Which means you either have to get bought or go public, and the number \\nof startups that go public is very small.\\nIf success probably means getting bought, should you make that a conscious goal? The old \\nanswer was no: you were supposed to pretend that you wanted to create a giant, public \\ncompany, and act surprised when someone made you an offer. Really, you want to buy us? \\nWell, I suppose we'd consider it, for the right price.\\nI think things are changing. If 98% of the time success means getting bought, why not be open \\nabout it? If 98% of the time you're doing product development on spec for some big company, \\nwhy not think of that as your task?

Don't fix Windows, because the \\nonly potential acquirer is Microsoft, and when there's only one acquirer, they don't have to hurry. \\nThey can take their time and copy you instead of buying you.

If you look at how famous startups got started, a lot of them weren't initially supposed \\nto be startups. Lotus began with a program Mitch Kapor wrote for a friend. Apple got started \\nbecause Steve Wozniak wanted to build microcomputers, and his employer, Hewlett-Packard, \\nwouldn't let him do it at work. Yahoo began as David Filo's personal collection of links.\\nThis is not the only way to start startups. You can sit down and consciously come up with an \\nidea for a company; we did.

Young founders are not a new phenomenon: the trend \\nbegan as soon as computers got cheap enough for college kids to afford them.\\nAnother of our hypotheses was that you can start a startup on less money than most people \\nthink. Other investors were surprised to hear the most we gave any group was $20,000. But we \\nknew it was possible to start on that little because we started Viaweb on $10,000.\\nAnd so it proved this summer. Three months' funding is enough to get into second gear.

It seems \\nlike a win for everyone. The only catch is that we get on average only about 5-7% of the upside, \\nwhile an employer gets nearly all of it. (We\\'re counting on it being 5-7% of a much larger \\nnumber.)\\nAs well as working hard, the groups all turned out to be extraordinarily responsible. I can\\'t think \\nof a time when one failed to do something they\\'d promised to, even by being late for an \\nappointment. This is another lesson the world has yet to learn.

They also wanted very much to get rich. \\nThese qualities might seem incompatible, but they're not. These guys want to get rich, but they \\nwant to do it by changing the world.

They want to make something people use.\\nI think this makes them more effective as founders. As hard as people will work for money, \\nthey'll work harder for a cause. And since success in a startup depends so much on motivation, \\nthe paradoxical result is that the people likely to make the most money are those who aren't in it \\njust for the money.\\nThe founders of Kiko, for example, are working on an Ajax calendar. They want to get rich, but \\nthey pay more attention to design than they would if that were their only motivation. You can tell \\njust by looking at it.\\nI never considered it till this summer, but this might be another reason startups run by hackers \\ntend to do better than those run by MBAs.

Their mean corporate culture only works for \\nmonopolies. Google is a better model.\\nConsidering that the summer founders are the sharks in this ocean, we were surprised how \\nfrightened most of them were of competitors. But now that I think of it, we were just as \\nfrightened when we started Viaweb. For the first year, our initial reaction to news of a competitor \\nwas always: we're doomed. Just as a hypochondriac magnifies his symptoms till he's convinced \\nhe has some terrible disease, when you're not used to competitors you magnify them into \\nmonsters.\\nHere's a handy rule for startups: competitors are rarely as dangerous as they seem.

In big companies, all the pressure is in the \\ndirection of over-engineering.\\nWhat Got Learned\\nOne thing we were curious about this summer was where these groups would need help. That \\nturned out to vary a lot. Some we helped with technical advice-- for example, about how to set \\nup an application to run on multiple servers. Most we helped with strategy questions, like what \\nto patent, and what to charge for and what to give away. Nearly all wanted advice about dealing \\nwith future investors: how much money should they take and what kind of terms should they \\nexpect?\\nHowever, all the groups quickly learned how to deal with stuff like patents and investors. These \\nproblems aren't intrinsically difficult, just unfamiliar.\\nIt was surprising-- slightly frightening even-- how fast they learned. The weekend before the \\ndemo day for investors, we had a practice session where all the groups gave their \\npresentations. They were all terrible.

So on demo day I told the assembled angels and VCs that these guys were \\nhackers, not MBAs, and so while their software was good, we should not expect slick \\npresentations from them.\\nThe groups then proceeded to give fabulously slick presentations. Gone were the mumbling \\nrecitations of lists of features. It was as if they'd spent the past week at acting school. I still don't \\nknow how they did it.\\nPerhaps watching each others' presentations helped them see what they'd been doing wrong. \\nJust as happens in college, the summer founders learned a lot from one another-- maybe more \\nthan they learned from us.

A lot went wrong, as \\nusually happens with startups. One group got an \"exploding term-sheet\" from some VCs. Pretty \\nmuch all the groups who had dealings with big companies found that big companies do \\neverything infinitely slowly. (This is to be expected. If big companies weren\\'t incapable, there \\nwould be no room for startups to exist.) And of course there were the usual nightmares \\nassociated with servers. \\nIn short, the disasters this summer were just the usual childhood diseases. Some of this \\nsummer\\'s eight startups will probably die eventually; it would be extraordinary if all eight \\nsucceeded.

In fact, we were surprised how much fun the summer was \\nfor us. The main reason was how much we liked the founders. They're so earnest and hard-\\nworking. They seem to like us too.

The SFP was just an experiment to get things started. But it worked so well \\nthat we plan to do all our investing this way, one cycle in the summer and one in winter. It\\'s \\nmore efficient for us, and better for the startups too.\\nSeveral groups said our weekly dinners saved them from a common problem afflicting startups: \\nworking so hard that one has no social life.

There are two ways to do it: give money \\nto the poor, or take it away from the rich. But they amount to the same thing, because if you \\nwant to give money to the poor, you have to get it from somewhere. You can't get it from the \\npoor, or they just end up where they started. You have to get it from the rich.\\nThere is of course a way to make the poor richer without simply shifting money from the rich. \\nYou could help the poor become more productive — for example, by improving access to \\neducation. Instead of taking money from engineers and giving it to checkout clerks, you could \\nenable people who would have become checkout clerks to become engineers.\\nThis is an excellent strategy for making the poor richer.

If there \\nare more engineers, then there are more opportunities to hire them and to sell them things. \\nHenry Ford couldn't have made a fortune building cars in a society in which most people were \\nstill subsistence farmers; he would have had neither workers nor customers.\\nIf you want to reduce economic inequality instead of just improving the overall standard of \\nliving, it's not enough just to raise up the poor. What if one of your newly minted engineers gets \\nambitious and goes on to become another Bill Gates? Economic inequality will be as bad as \\never. If you actually want to compress the gap between rich and poor, you have to push down \\non the top as well as pushing up on the bottom.\\nHow do you push down on the top?

You could try to decrease the productivity of the people \\nwho make the most money: make the best surgeons operate with their left hands, force popular \\nactors to overeat, and so on. But this approach is hard to implement. The only practical solution \\nis to let people do the best work they can, and then (either by taxation or by limiting what they \\ncan charge) to confiscate whatever you deem to be surplus.\\nSo let\\'s be clear what reducing economic inequality means. It is identical with taking money \\nfrom the rich.\\nWhen you transform a mathematical expression into another form, you often notice new things. \\nSo it is in this case. Taking money from the rich turns out to have consequences one might not \\nforesee when one phrases the same idea in terms of \"reducing inequality.\"\\nThe problem is, risk and reward have to be proportionate. A bet', 'ey from the rich turns out to have consequences one might not \\nforesee when one phrases the same idea in terms of \"reducing inequality.\"\\nThe problem is, risk and reward have to be proportionate. A bet with only a 10% chance of \\nwinning has to pay more than one with a 50% chance of winning, or no one will take it. So if you \\nlop off the top of the possible rewards, you thereby decrease people\\'s willingness to take risks.\\nTransposing into our original expression, we get: decreasing economic inequality means \\ndecreasing the risk people are willing to take.\\nThere are whole classes of risks that are no longer worth taking if the maximum return is \\ndecreased. One reason high tax rates are disastrous is that this class of risks includes starting \\nnew companies.\\nInvestors\\nStartups are intrinsically risky.

One big wave and \\nyou're sunk. A competing product, a downturn in the economy, a delay in getting funding or \\nregulatory approval, a patent suit, changing technical standards, the departure of a key \\nemployee, the loss of a big account — any one of these can destroy you overnight. It seems \\nonly about 1 in 10 startups succeeds. [1]\\nOur startup paid its first round of outside investors 36x. Which meant, with current US tax rates, \\nthat it made sense to invest in us if we had better than a 1 in 24 chance of succeeding. That \\nsounds about right. That's probably roughly how we looked when we were a couple of nerds \\nwith no business experience operating out of an apartment.\\nIf that kind of risk doesn't pay, venture investing, as we know it, doesn't happen.\\nThat might be ok if there were other sources of capital for new companies.

Because then you're asking government or almost-\\ngovernment employees to do the one thing they are least able to do: take risks.\\nAs anyone who has worked for the government knows, the important thing is not to make the \\nright choices, but to make choices that can be justified later if they fail. If there is a safe option, \\nthat's the one a bureaucrat will choose. But that is exactly the wrong way to do venture \\ninvesting. The nature of the business means that you want to make terribly risky choices, if the \\nupside looks good enough.\\nVCs are currently paid in a way that makes them focus on the upside: they get a percentage of \\nthe fund's gains.

They\\'d turn down the nerds in \\nfavor of the smooth-talking MBA in a suit, because that investment would be easier to justify \\nlater if it failed.\\nFounders\\nBut even if you could somehow redesign venture funding to work without allowing VCs to \\nbecome rich, there\\'s another kind of investor you simply cannot replace: the startups\\' founders \\nand early employees.\\nWhat they invest is their time and ideas.

If \\nyou\\'re going to invest your time in something with a small chance of succeeding, you\\'ll only do it \\nif there is a proportionately large payoff. [2] If large payoffs aren\\'t allowed, you may as well play \\nit safe.\\nLike many startup founders, I did it to get rich. But not because I wanted to buy expensive \\nthings. What I wanted was security. I wanted to make enough money that I didn\\'t have to worry \\nabout money.

If you can't ensure your own \\nsecurity, the next best thing is to make a nest for yourself in some large organization where your \\nstatus depends mostly on seniority. [3]\\nEven if we could somehow replace investors, I don't see how we could replace founders. \\nInvestors mainly contribute money, which in principle is the same no matter what the source. \\nBut the founders contribute ideas.

I'm heading for a conclusion to which many readers \\nwill have to be dragged kicking and screaming, so I've tried to make each link unbreakable. \\nDecreasing economic inequality means taking money from the rich. Since risk and reward are \\nequivalent, decreasing potential rewards automatically decreases people's appetite for risk. \\nStartups are intrinsically risky. Without the prospect of rewards proportionate to the risk, \\nfounders will not invest their time in a startup. Founders are irreplaceable. So eliminating \\neconomic inequality means eliminating startups.\\nEconomic inequality is not just a consequence of startups. It's the engine that drives them, in \\nthe same way a fall of water drives a water mill. People start startups in the hope of becoming \\nmuch richer than they were before. And if your society tries to prevent anyone from being much \\nricher than anyone else, it will also prevent one person from being much richer at t2 than t1.\\nGrowth\\nThi\", \"uch richer than they were before.

It's not just that if you eliminate economic inequality, you \\nget no startups. To the extent you reduce economic inequality, you decrease the number of \\nstartups. [4] Increase taxes, and willingness to take risks decreases in proportion.\\nAnd that seems bad for everyone. New technology and new jobs both come disproportionately \\nfrom new companies. Indeed, if you don't have startups, pretty soon you won't have established \\ncompanies either, just as, if you stop having kids, pretty soon you won't have any adults.\\nIt sounds benevolent to say we ought to reduce economic inequality.

And yet \\nthe one implies the other.\\nIndeed, it may be that reducing investors' appetite for risk doesn't merely kill off larval startups, \\nbut kills off the most promising ones especially. Startups yield faster growth at greater risk than \\nestablished companies. Does this trend also hold among startups? That is, are the riskiest \\nstartups the ones that generate most growth if they succeed? I suspect the answer is yes. And \\nthat's a chilling thought, because it means that if you cut investors' appetite for risk, the most \\nbeneficial startups are the first to go.\\nNot all rich people got that way from startups, of course.

If you made it so that people could only get rich by starting startups, \\npeople who wanted to get rich would all start startups. And that might be a great thing. But I \\ndon't think it would have much effect on the distribution of wealth. People who want to get rich \\nwill do whatever they have to. If startups are the only way to do it, you'll just get far more people \\nstarting startups. (If you write the laws very carefully, that is. More likely, you'll just get a lot of \\npeople doing things that can be made to look on paper like startups.)\\nIf we're determined to eliminate economic inequality, there is still one way out: we could say that \\nwe're willing to go ahead and do without startups.

(If you can come up with a remotely plausible story, you \\ncan make a fortune writing business books and consulting for large companies.) [5]\\nOk, so we get slower growth. Is that so bad? Well, one reason it's bad in practice is that other \\ncountries might not agree to slow down with us. If you're content to develop new technologies at \\na slower rate than the rest of the world, what happens is that you don't invent anything at all. \\nAnything you might discover has already been invented elsewhere.

The only defense is to isolate yourself, as communist countries did in the \\ntwentieth century. But the problem then is, you have to become a police state to enforce it. \\nWealth and Power\\nI realize startups are not the main target of those who want to eliminate economic inequality. \\nWhat they really dislike is the sort of wealth that becomes self-perpetuating through an alliance \\nwith power.

That\\'s less the \\nrule now. Our generation wants to get paid up front. Instead of developing a product for some \\nbig company in the expectation of getting job security in return, we develop the product \\nourselves, in a startup, and sell it to the big company. At the very least we want options.\\nAmong other things, this shift has created the appearance of a rapid increase in economic \\ninequality. But really the two cases are not as different as they l', 'mpany. At the very least we want options.\\nAmong other things, this shift has created the appearance of a rapid increase in economic \\ninequality. But really the two cases are not as different as they look in economic statistics.\\nEconomic statistics are misleading because they ignore the value of safe jobs. An easy job from \\nwhich one can\\'t be fired is worth money; exchanging the two is one of the commonest forms of \\ncorruption. A sinecure is, in effect, an annuity. Except sinecures don\\'t appear in economic \\nstatistics. If they did, it would be clear that in practice socialist countries have nontrivial \\ndisparities of wealth, because they usually have a class of powerful bureaucrats who are paid \\nmostly by seniority and can never be fired.\\nWhile not a sinecure, a position on the corporate ladder was genuinely valuable, because big \\ncompanies tried not to fire people, and promoted from within based largely on seniority. A \\nposition on the corporate ladder had a value analogous to the \"goo', 'dder was genuinely valuable, because big \\ncompanies tried not to fire people, and promoted from within based largely on seniority. A \\nposition on the corporate ladder had a value analogous to the \"goodwill\" that is a very real \\nelement in the valuation of companies. It meant one could expect future high paying jobs.\\nOne of main causes of the decay of the corporate ladder is the trend for takeovers that began in \\nthe 1980s. Why waste your time climbing a ladder that might disappear before you reach the \\ntop?\\nAnd, by no coincidence, the corporate ladder was one of the reasons the early corporate \\nraiders were so successful. It\\'s not only economic statistics that ignore the value of safe jobs. \\nCorporate balance sheets do too. One reason it was profitable to carve up 1980s companies \\nand sell them for parts was that they hadn\\'t formally acknowledged their implicit debt to \\nemployees who had done good work and expected to be rewarded with high-paying executive \\njobs when their time came.\\nI', \" them for parts was that they hadn't formally acknowledged their implicit debt to \\nemployees who had done good work and expected to be rewarded with high-paying executive \\njobs when their time came.\\nIn the movie Wall Street, Gordon Gekko ridicules a company overloaded with vice presidents. \\nBut the company may not be as corrupt as it seems; those VPs' cushy jobs were probably \\npayment for work done earlier.\\nI like the new model better. For one thing, it seems a bad plan to treat jobs as rewards. Plenty of \\ngood engineers got made into bad managers that way. And the old system meant people had to \\ndeal with a lot more corporate politics, in order to protect the work they'd invested in a position \\non the ladder.\\nThe big disadvantage of the new system is that it involves more risk. If you develop ideas in a \\nstartup instead of within a big company, any number of random factors could sink you before \\nyou can finish. But maybe the older generation would laugh at me for saying that the way w\", \"elop ideas in a \\nstartup instead of within a big company, any number of random factors could sink you before \\nyou can finish. But maybe the older generation would laugh at me for saying that the way we do \\nthings is riskier. After all, projects within big companies were always getting cancelled as a \\nresult of arbitrary decisions from higher up. My father's entire industry (breeder reactors) \\ndisappeared that way.\\nFor better or worse, the idea of the corporate ladder is probably gone for good. The new model \\nseems more liquid, and more efficient. But it is less of a change, financially, than one might \\nthink. Our fathers weren't that stupid.\\nWhat Business Can Learn from Open Source - # 46\\nAugust 2005\\n(This essay is derived from a talk at Oscon 2005.)\\nLately companies have been paying more attention to open source. Ten years ago there \\nseemed a real danger Microsoft would extend its monopoly to servers. It seems safe to say now \\nthat open source has prevented that. A recent survey found\", \"attention to open source. Ten years ago there \\nseemed a real danger Microsoft would extend its monopoly to servers. It seems safe to say now \\nthat open source has prevented that. A recent survey found 52% of companies are replacing \\nWindows servers with Linux servers. [1]\\nMore significant, I think, is which 52% they are. At this point, anyone proposing to run Windows \\non servers should be prepared to explain what they know about servers that Google, Yahoo, \\nand Amazon don't.\\nBut the biggest thing business has to learn from open source is not about Linux or Firefox, but \\nabout the forces that produced them. Ultimately these will affect a lot more than what software \\nyou use.\\nWe may be able to get a fix on these underlying forces by triangulating from open source and \\nblogging. As you've probably noticed, they have a lot in common.\\nLike open source, blogging is something people do themselves, for free, because they enjoy it. \\nLike open source hackers, bloggers compete with people working\", \"bably noticed, they have a lot in common.\\nLike open source, blogging is something people do themselves, for free, because they enjoy it. \\nLike open source hackers, bloggers compete with people working for money, and often win. The \\nmethod of ensuring quality is also the same: Darwinian. Companies ensure quality through \\nrules to prevent employees from screwing up. But you don't need that when the audience can \\ncommunicate with one another. People just produce whatever they want; the good stuff \\nspreads, and the bad gets ignored. And in both cases, feedback from the audience improves \\nthe best work.\\nAnother thing blogging and open source have in common is the Web. People have always been \\nwilling to do great work for free, but before the Web it was harder to reach an audience or \\ncollaborate on projects.\\nAmateurs\\nI think the most important of the new principles business has to learn is that people work a lot \\nharder on stuff they like.

Well, that's news to no one. So how can I claim business has to learn \\nit? When I say business doesn't know this, I mean the structure of business doesn't reflect it.\\nBusiness still reflects an older model, exemplified by the French word for working: travailler. It \\nhas an English cousin, travail, and what it means is torture. [2]\\nThis turns out not to be the last word on work, however. As societies get richer, they learn \\nsomething about work that's a lot like what they learn about diet. We know now that the \\nhealthiest diet is the one our peasant ancestors were forced to eat because they were poor. \\nLike rich food, idleness only seems desirable when you don't get enough of it. I think we were \\ndesigned to work, just as we were designed to eat a certain amount of fiber, and we feel bad if \\nwe don't.\\nThere's a name for people who work for \", 'ble when you don\\'t get enough of it. I think we were \\ndesigned to work, just as we were designed to eat a certain amount of fiber, and we feel bad if \\nwe don\\'t.\\nThere\\'s a name for people who work for the love of it: amateurs. The word now has such bad \\nconnotations that we forget its etymology, though it\\'s staring us in the face. \"Amateur\" was \\noriginally rather a complimentary word. But the thing to be in the twentieth century was \\nprofessional, which amateurs, by definition, are not.\\nThat\\'s why the business world was so surprised by one lesson from open source: that people \\nworking for love often surpass those working for money. Users don\\'t switch from Explorer to \\nFirefox because they want to hack the source. They switch because it\\'s a better browser.\\nIt\\'s not that Microsoft isn\\'t trying. They know controlling the browser is one of the keys to \\nretaining their monopoly.

They know controlling the browser is one of the keys to \\nretaining their monopoly. The problem is the same they face in operating systems: they can\\'t \\npay people enough to build something better than a group of inspired hackers will build for free.\\nI suspect professionalism was always overrated-- not just in the literal sense of working for \\nmoney, but also connotations like formality and detachment. Inconceivable as it would have \\nseemed in, say, 1970, I think professionalism was largely a fashion, driven by conditions that \\nhappened to exist in the twentieth century.\\nOne of the most powerful of those was the existence of \"channels.\" Revealingly, the same term \\nwas used for both products and information: there were distribution channels, and TV and radio \\nchannels.\\nIt was the narrowness of such channels that made professionals seem so superior to amateurs. \\nThere were only a few jobs as professional journalists, for example, so competition ensured the \\naverage journalist was fairly', 's of such channels that made professionals seem so superior to amateurs. \\nThere were only a few jobs as professional journalists, for example, so competition ensured the \\naverage journalist was fairly good. Whereas anyone can express opinions about current events \\nin a bar. And so the average person expressing his opinions in a bar sounds like an idiot \\ncompared to a journalist writing about the subject.\\nOn the Web, the barrier for publishing your ideas is even lower. You don\\'t have to buy a drink, \\nand they even let kids in. Millions of people are publishing online, and the average level of what \\nthey\\'re writing, as you might expect, is not very good. This has led some in the media to \\nconclude that blogs don\\'t present much of a threat-- that blogs are just a fad.\\nActually, the fad is the word \"blog,\" at least the way the print media now use it. What they mean \\nby \"blogger\" is not someone who publishes in a weblog format, but anyone who publishes \\nonline. That\\'s going to become a prob', ' word \"blog,\" at least the way the print media now use it. What they mean \\nby \"blogger\" is not someone who publishes in a weblog format, but anyone who publishes \\nonline. That\\'s going to become a problem as the Web becomes the default medium for \\npublication. So I\\'d like to suggest an alternative word for someone who publishes online. How \\nabout \"writer?\"\\nThose in the print media who dismiss the writing online because of its low average quality are \\nmissing an important point: no one reads the average blog. In the old world of channels, it \\nmeant something to talk about average quality, because that\\'s what you were getting whether \\nyou liked it or not. But now you can read any writer you want. So the average quality of writing \\nonline isn\\'t what the print media are competing against. They\\'re competing against the best \\nwriting online. And, like Microsoft, they\\'re losing.\\nI know that from my own experience as a reader. Though most print publications are online, I \\nprobably read two or t', \"re competing against the best \\nwriting online. And, like Microsoft, they're losing.\\nI know that from my own experience as a reader. Though most print publications are online, I \\nprobably read two or three articles on individual people's sites for every one I read on the site of \\na newspaper or magazine.\\nAnd when I read, say, New York Times stories, I never reach them through the Times front \\npage. Most I find through aggregators like Google News or Slashdot or Delicious. Aggregators \\nshow how much better you can do than the channel. The New York Times front page is a list of \\narticles written by people who work for the New York Times. Delicious is a list of articles that are \\ninteresting. And it's only now that you can see the two side by side that you notice how little \\noverlap there is.\\nMost articles in the print media are boring. For example, the president notices that a majority of \\nvoters now think invading Iraq was a mistake, so he makes an address to the nation to drum up \\nsuppo\", 'Most articles in the print media are boring. For example, the president notices that a majority of \\nvoters now think invading Iraq was a mistake, so he makes an address to the nation to drum up \\nsupport. Where is the man bites dog in that? I didn\\'t hear the speech, but I could probably tell \\nyou exactly what he said. A speech like that is, in the most literal sense, not news: there is \\nnothing new in it. [3]\\nNor is there anything new, except the names and places, in most \"news\" about things going \\nwrong. A child is abducted; there\\'s a tornado; a ferry sinks; someone gets bitten by a shark; a \\nsmall plane crashes. And what do you learn about the world from these stories? Absolutely \\nnothing. They\\'re outlying data points; what makes them gripping also makes them irrelevant.\\nAs in software, when professionals produce such crap, it\\'s not surprising if amateurs can do \\nbetter.

[4]\\nWorkplaces\\nAnother thing blogs and open source software have in common is that they're often made by \\npeople working at home. That may not seem surprising. But it should be. It's the architectural \\nequivalent of a home-made aircraft shooting down an F-18. Companies spend millions to build \\noffice buildings for a single purpose: to be a place to work. And yet people working in their own \\nhomes, which aren't even designed to be workplaces, end up being more productive.\\nThis proves something a lot of us have suspected. The average office is a miserable place to \\nget work done. And a lot of what makes offices bad are the very qualities we associate with \\nprofessionalism.

And it\\'s not just the way offices look that\\'s bleak. The way people act is just \\nas bad.\\nThings are different in a startup. Often as not a startup begins in an apartment. Instead of \\nmatching beige cubicles they have an assortment of furniture they bought used. They work odd \\nhours, wearing the most casual of clothing. They look at whatever they want online without \\nworrying whether it\\'s \"work safe.\" The cheery, bland language of the office is replaced by \\nwicked humor. And you know what?

There are usually a few people in a company who really have to, but the \\nreason most employees work fixed hours is that the company can't measure their productivity.\\nThe basic idea behind office hours is that if you can't make people work, you can at least \\nprevent them from having fun. If employees have to be in the building a certain number of hours \\na day, and are forbidden to do non-work things while there, then they must be working. In \\ntheory. In practice they spend a lot of their time in a no-man's land, where they're neither \\nworking nor having fun.\\nIf you could measure how much work people did, many companies wouldn't ne\", \"ing. In \\ntheory. In practice they spend a lot of their time in a no-man's land, where they're neither \\nworking nor having fun.\\nIf you could measure how much work people did, many companies wouldn't need any fixed \\nworkday. You could just say: this is what you have to do. Do it whenever you like, wherever you \\nlike. If your work requires you to talk to other people in the company, then you may need to be \\nhere a certain amount. Otherwise we don't care.\\nThat may seem utopian, but it's what we told people who came to work for our company. There \\nwere no fixed office hours. I never showed up before 11 in the morning. But we weren't saying \\nthis to be benevolent. We were saying: if you work here we expect you to get a lot done. Don't \\ntry to fool us just by being here a lot.\\nThe problem with the facetime model is not just that it's demoralizing, but that the people \\npretending to work interrupt the ones actually working. I'm convinced the facetime model is the \\nmain reason large organizatio\", \"e facetime model is not just that it's demoralizing, but that the people \\npretending to work interrupt the ones actually working. I'm convinced the facetime model is the \\nmain reason large organizations have so many meetings. Per capita, large organizations \\naccomplish very little. And yet all those people have to be on site at least eight hours a day. \\nWhen so much time goes in one end and so little achievement comes out the other, something \\nhas to give. And meetings are the main mechanism for taking up the slack.\\nFor one year I worked at a regular nine to five job, and I remember well the strange, cozy \\nfeeling that comes over one during meetings. I was very aware, because of the novelty, that I \\nwas being paid for programming. It seemed just amazing, as if there was a machine on my desk \\nthat spat out a dollar bill every two minutes no matter what I did. Even while I was in the \\nbathroom! But because the imaginary machine was always running, I felt I always ought to be \\nworking. An\", \"k \\nthat spat out a dollar bill every two minutes no matter what I did. Even while I was in the \\nbathroom! But because the imaginary machine was always running, I felt I always ought to be \\nworking. And so meetings felt wonderfully relaxing. They counted as work, just like \\nprogramming, but they were so much easier. All you had to do was sit and look attentive.\\nMeetings are like an opiate with a network effect. So is email, on a smaller scale. And in \\naddition to the direct cost in time, there's the cost in fragmentation-- breaking people's day up \\ninto bits too small to be useful.\\nYou can see how dependent you've become on something by removing it suddenly. So for big \\ncompanies I propose the following experiment. Set aside one day where meetings are \\nforbidden-- where everyone has to sit at their desk all day and work without interruption on \\nthings they can do without talking to anyone else. Some amount of communication is necessary \\nin most jobs, but I'm sure many employees could fi\", 'at their desk all day and work without interruption on \\nthings they can do without talking to anyone else. Some amount of communication is necessary \\nin most jobs, but I\\'m sure many employees could find eight hours worth of stuff they could do by \\nthemselves. You could call it \"Work Day.\"\\nThe other problem with pretend work is that it often looks better than real work. When I\\'m \\nwriting or hacking I spend as much time just thinking as I do actually typing. Half the time I\\'m \\nsitting drinking a cup of tea, or walking around the neighborhood. This is a critical phase-- this is \\nwhere ideas come from-- and yet I\\'d feel guilty doing this in most offices, with everyone else \\nlooking busy.\\nIt\\'s hard to see how bad some practice is till you have something to compare it to. And that\\'s \\none reason open source, and even blogging in some cases, are so important. They show us \\nwhat real work looks like.\\nWe\\'re funding eight new startups at the moment.

But we didn't propose that to save money. We did it because \\nwe want their software to be good. Working in crappy informal spaces is one of the things \\nstartups do right without realizing it. As soon as you get into an office, work and life start to drift \\napart.\\nThat is one of the key tenets of professionalism. Work and life are supposed to be separate. But \\nthat part, I'm convinced, is a mistake.\\nBottom-Up\\nThe third big lesson we can learn from open source and blogging is that ideas can bubble up \\nfrom the bottom, instead of flowing down from the top.

Open source and blogging both work \\nbottom-up: people make what they want, and the best stuff prevails.\\nDoes this sound familiar? It's the principle of a market economy. Ironically, though open source \\nand blogs are done for free, those worlds resemble market economies, while most companies, \\nfor all their talk about the value of free markets, are run internally like communist states.\\nThere are two forces that together steer design: ideas about what to do next, and the \\nenforcement of quality. In the channel era, both flowed down from the top. For example, \\nnewspaper editors assigned stories to reporters, then edited what they wrote.\\nOpen source and blogging show us things don't have to work that way. Ideas and even the \\nenforcement of quality can flow bottom-up. And in both cases the results are not merely \\nacceptable, but better.

As we got close to publication, I found I was very worried about \\nthe essays in Hackers & Painters that hadn't been online. Once an essay has had a couple \\nthousand page views I feel reasonably confident about it. But these had had literally orders of \\nmagnitude less scrutiny. It felt like releasing software without testing it.\\nThat's what all publishing used to be like. If you got ten people to read a manuscript, you were \\nlucky. But I'd become so used to publishing online that the old method now seemed alarmingly \\nunreliable, like navigating by dead reckoning once you'd gotten used to a GPS.\\nThe other thing I like about publishing online is that you can write what you want and publish \\nwhen you want.

As I was waiting to hear back, I found to my surprise that I was \\nhoping they'd reject it. Then I could put it online right away. If they accepted it, it wouldn't be \\nread by anyone for months, and in the meantime I'd have to fight word-by-word to save it from \\nbeing mangled by some twenty five year old copy editor. [5]\\nMany employees would like to build great things for the companies they work for, but more often \\nthan not management won't let them.

That last one is a big problem. When \\nyou're young, you occasionally say and do stupid things even when you're smart. So if the \\nalgorithm is to filter out people who say stupid things, as many investors and employers \\nunconsciously do, you're going to get a lot of false positives.\\nMost organizations who hire people right out of college are only aware of the average value of \\n22 year olds, which is not that high.

But most startups that succeed do it by getting bought. And usually the acquirer doesn\\'t \\njust want the technology, but the people who created it as well.\\nOften big companies buy startups before they\\'re profitable. Obviously in such cases they\\'re not \\nafter revenues. What they want is the development team and the software they\\'ve built so far. \\nWhen a startup gets bought for 2 or 3 million six months in, it\\'s really more of a hiring bonus \\nthan an acquisition.\\nI think this sort of thing will happen more and more, and that it will be better for everyone.

Buying larval startups solves that problem for them: the acquirer \\ndoesn't pay till the developers have proven themselves. Acquirers are protected on the \\ndownside, but still get most of the upside.\\nProduct Development\\nBuying startups also solves another problem afflicting big companies: they can't do product \\ndevelopment. Big companies are good at extracting the value from existing products, but bad at \\ncreating new ones.\\nWhy? It's worth studying this phenomenon in detail, because this is the raison d'etre of startups.\\nTo start with, most big companies have some kind of turf to protect, and this tends to warp their \\ndevelopment decisions.

For example, Web-based applications are hot now, but within Microsoft \\nthere must be a lot of ambivalence about them, because the very idea of Web-based software \\nthreatens the desktop. So any Web-based application that Microsoft ends up with, will probably, \\nlike Hotmail, be something developed outside the company.\\nAnother reason big companies are bad at developing new products is that the kind of people \\nwho do that tend not to have much power in big companies (unless they happen to be the \\nCEO). Disruptive technologies are developed by disruptive people. And they either don't work \\nfor the big company, or have been outmaneuvered by yes-men and have comparatively little \\ninfluence.\\nBig companies also lose because they usually only build one of each thing.

When you only \\nhave one Web browser, you can't do anything really risky with it. If ten different startups design \\nten different Web browsers and you take the best, you'll probably get something better.\\nThe more general version of this problem is that there are too many new ideas for companies to \\nexplore them all. There might be 500 startups right now who think they're making something \\nMicrosoft might buy. Even Microsoft probably couldn't manage 500 development projects in-\\nhouse.\\nBig companies also don't pay people the right way. People developing a new product at a big \\ncompany get paid roughly the same whether it succeeds or fails. People at a startup expect to \\nget rich if the product succeeds, and get nothing if it fails. [2] So naturally the people at the \\nstartup work a lot harder.\\nThe mere bigness of big companies is an obstacle. In startups, developers a\", \"et rich if the product succeeds, and get nothing if it fails. [2] So naturally the people at the \\nstartup work a lot harder.\\nThe mere bigness of big companies is an obstacle. In startups, developers are often forced to \\ntalk directly to users, whether they want to or not, because there is no one else to do sales and \\nsupport. It's painful doing sales, but you learn much more from trying to sell people something \\nthan reading what they said in focus groups.\\nAnd then of course, big companies are bad at product development because they're bad at \\neverything. Everything happens slower in big companies than small ones, and product \\ndevelopment is something that has to happen fast, because you have to go through a lot of \\niterations to get something good.\\nTrend\\nI think the trend of big companies buying startups will only accelerate.

Most companies, at least unconsciously, feel they ought to be able \\nto develop stuff in house, and that buying startups is to some degree an admission of failure. \\nAnd so, as people generally do with admissions of failure, they put it off for as long as possible. \\nThat makes the acquisition very expensive when it finally happens.\\nWhat companies should do is go out and discover startups when they're young, before VCs \\nhave puffed them up into something that costs hundreds of millions to acquire. Much of what \\nVCs add, the acquirer doesn't need anyway.\\nWhy don't acquirers try to predict the companies they're going to have to buy for hundreds of \\nmillions, and grab them early for a tenth or a twentieth of that?

It also gives them more power relative to investors.\\nThe conventional wisdom among VCs is that hackers shouldn't be allowed to run their own \\ncompanies. The founders are supposed to accept MBAs as their bosses, and themselves take \\non some title like Chief Technical Officer. There may be cases where this is a good idea. But I \\nthink founders will increasingly be able to push back in the matter of control, because they just \\ndon't need the investors' money as much as they used to.\\nStartups are a comparatively new phenomenon.

So it may be \\nworth standing back and understanding what's going on, instead of just doing the default thing.\\nAll through college, and probably long before that, most undergrads have been thinking about \\nwhat employers want. But what really matters is what customers want, because they're the \\nones who give employers the money to pay you.\\nSo instead of thinking about what employers want, you're probably better off thinking directly \\nabout what users want. To the extent there's any difference between the two, you can even use \\nthat to your advantage if you start a company of your own. For example, big companies like \\ndocile conformists.

Grad school can be a pretty good deal, even if you think of one day \\nstarting a startup. You can start one when you're done, or even pull the ripcord part way \\nthrough, like the founders of Yahoo and Google.\\nGrad school makes a good launch pad for startups, because you're collected together with a lot \\nof smart people, and you have bigger chunks of time to work on your own projects than an \\nundergrad or corporate employee would.

What\\'s different about your brain after you have \"experience,\" and can you make \\nthat change happen faster?\\nI now have some data on this, and I can tell you what tends to be missing when people lack \\nexperience. I\\'ve said that every startup needs three things: to start with good people, to make \\nsomething users want, and not to spend too much money. It\\'s the middle one you get wrong \\nwhen you\\'re inexperienced. There are plenty of undergrads with enough technical skill to write \\ngood software, and undergrads are not especially prone to waste money. If they get something \\nwrong, it\\'s usually not realizing they have to make something people want.\\nThis is not exclusively a failing of the young.

It\\'s common for startup founders of all ages to build \\nthings no one wants.\\nFortunately, this flaw should be easy to fix. If undergrads were all bad programmers, the \\nproblem would be a lot harder. It can take years to learn how to program. But I don\\'t think it \\ntakes years to learn how to make things people want. My hypothesis is that all you have to do is \\nsmack hackers on the side of the head and tell them: Wake up. Don\\'t sit here making up a priori \\ntheories about what users need. Go find some users and see what they need.\\nMost successful startups not only do something very specific, but solve a problem people \\nalready know they have.\\nThe big change that \"experience\" causes in your brain is learning that you need to solve \\npeople\\'s problems. Once you grasp that, you advance quickly to the next step, which is figuring \\nout what those problems are. And that takes some effort, becaus', \"ain is learning that you need to solve \\npeople's problems. Once you grasp that, you advance quickly to the next step, which is figuring \\nout what those problems are. And that takes some effort, because the way software actually \\ngets used, especially by the people who pay the most for it, is not at all what you might expect. \\nFor example, the stated purpose of Powerpoint is to present ideas. Its real role is to overcome \\npeople's fear of public speaking. It allows you to give an impressive-looking talk about nothing, \\nand it causes the audience to sit in a dark room looking at slides, instead of a bright one looking \\nat you.\\nThis kind of thing is out there for anyone to see. The key is to know to look for it-- to realize that \\nhaving an idea for a startup is not like having an idea for a class project. The goal in a startup is \\nnot to write a cool piece of software.

I think there are a lot of \\nundergrads whose brains are in a similar position: they're only a few steps away from being able \\nto start successful startups, if they wanted to, but they don't realize it. They have more than \\nenough technical skill.

And you don't want to pool risk, \\nbecause the younger you are, the more risk you should take.\\nA Public Service Message\\nI'd like to conclude with a joint message from me and your parents. Don't drop out of college to \\nstart a startup. There's no rush. There will be plenty of time to start companies after you \\ngraduate. In fact, it may be just as well to go work for an existing company for a couple years \\nafter you graduate, to learn how companies work.\\nAnd yet, when I think about it, I can't imagine telling Bill Gates at 19 that he should wait till he \\ngraduated to start a company. He'd have told me to get lost. And could I have honestly claimed \\nthat he was harming his future-- that he was learning less by working at ground zero of the \\nmicrocomputer revolution than he would have if he'd been taking classes back at Harvard? No, \\np\", \"ly claimed \\nthat he was harming his future-- that he was learning less by working at ground zero of the \\nmicrocomputer revolution than he would have if he'd been taking classes back at Harvard? No, \\nprobably not.\\nAnd yes, while it is probably true that you'll learn some valuable things by going to work for an \\nexisting company for a couple years before starting your own, you'd learn a thing or two running \\nyour own company during that time too.\\nThe advice about going to work for someone else would get an even colder reception from the \\n19 year old Bill Gates. So I'm supposed to finish college, then go work for another company for \\ntwo years, and then I can start my own? I have to wait till I'm 23? That's four years. That's more \\nthan twenty percent of my life so far. Plus in four years it will be way too late to make money \\nwriting a Basic interpreter for the Altair.\\nAnd he'd be right.

And while that would probably have been better for all of us, it wouldn't have \\nbeen better for him.\\nSo while I stand by our responsible advice to finish college and then go work for a while before \\nstarting a startup, I have to admit it's one of those things the old tell the young, but don't expect \\nthem to listen to.

Because PR firms tell them to. \\nOne of the most surprising things I discovered during my brief business career was the \\nexistence of the PR industry, lurking like a huge, quiet submarine beneath the news. Of the \\nstories you read in traditional media that aren\\'t about politics, crimes, or disasters, more than \\nhalf probably come from PR firms.\\nI know because I spent years hunting such \"press hits.\" Our startup spent its entire marketing \\nbudget on PR: at a time when we were assembling our own computers to save money, we were \\npaying a PR firm $16,000 a month. And they were worth it. PR is the news equivalent of search \\nengine optimization; instead of buying ads, which readers ignore, you get yourself inserted \\ndirectly into the stories.

And we weren\\'t the only ones they did great things for. In 1997 I got a call \\nfrom another startup founder considering hiring them to promote his company. I told him they \\nwere PR gods, worth every penny of their outrageous fees. But I remember thinking his \\ncompany\\'s name was odd. Why call an auction site \"eBay\"?\\nSymbiosis\\nPR is not dishonest. Not quite. In fact, the reason the best PR firms are so effective is precisely \\nthat they aren\\'t dishonest. They give reporters genuinely valuable information. A good PR firm \\nwon\\'t bug reporters just because the client tells them to; they\\'ve worked hard to build their \\ncredibility with reporters, and they don\\'t want to destroy it by feeding them mere propaganda.\\nIf anyone is dishonest, it\\'s the reporters. The main reason PR firms exist is that reporters are \\nlazy. Or, to put it more nicely, overworked. Really the', \"to destroy it by feeding them mere propaganda.\\nIf anyone is dishonest, it's the reporters. The main reason PR firms exist is that reporters are \\nlazy. Or, to put it more nicely, overworked. Really they ought to be out there digging up stories \\nfor themselves. But it's so tempting to sit in their offices and let PR firms bring the stories to \\nthem. After all, they know good PR firms won't lie to them.\\nA good flatterer doesn't lie, but tells his victim selective truths (what a nice color your eyes are). \\nGood PR firms use the same strategy: they give reporters stories that are true, but whose truth \\nfavors their clients.\\nFor example, our PR firm often pitched stories about how the Web let small merchants compete \\nwith big ones. This was perfectly true. But the reason reporters ended up writing stories about \\nthis particular truth, rather than some other one, was that small merchants were our target \\nmarket, and we were paying the piper.\\nDifferent publications vary greatly in their relian\", 'ng stories about \\nthis particular truth, rather than some other one, was that small merchants were our target \\nmarket, and we were paying the piper.\\nDifferent publications vary greatly in their reliance on PR firms. At the bottom of the heap are \\nthe trade press, who make most of their money from advertising and would give the magazines \\naway for free if advertisers would let them. [2] The average trade publication is a bunch of ads, \\nglued together by just enough articles to make it look like a magazine. They\\'re so desperate for \\n\"content\" that some will print your press releases almost verbatim, if you take the trouble to \\nwrite them to read like articles.\\nAt the other extreme are publications like the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. \\nTheir reporters do go out and find their own stories, at least some of the time. They\\'ll listen to \\nPR firms, but briefly and skeptically. We managed to get press hits in almost every publication \\nwe wanted, but we never managed to crack the', 'own stories, at least some of the time. They\\'ll listen to \\nPR firms, but briefly and skeptically. We managed to get press hits in almost every publication \\nwe wanted, but we never managed to crack the print edition of the Times. [3]\\nThe weak point of the top reporters is not laziness, but vanity. You don\\'t pitch stories to them. \\nYou have to approach them as if you were a specimen under their all-seeing microscope, and \\nmake it seem as if the story you want them to run is something they thought of themselves.\\nOur greatest PR coup was a two-part one. We estimated, based on some fairly informal math, \\nthat there were about 5000 stores on the Web. We got one paper to print this number, which \\nseemed neutral enough. But once this \"fact\" was out there in print, we could quote it to other \\npublications, and claim that with 1000 users we had 20% of the online store market.\\nThis was roughly true. We really did have the biggest share of the online store market, and \\n5000 was our best guess at i', 'cations, and claim that with 1000 users we had 20% of the online store market.\\nThis was roughly true. We really did have the biggest share of the online store market, and \\n5000 was our best guess at its size. But the way the story appeared in the press sounded a lot \\nmore definite.\\nReporters like definitive statements. For example, many of the stories about Jeremy Jaynes\\'s \\nconviction say that he was one of the 10 worst spammers. This \"fact\" originated in Spamhaus\\'s \\nROKSO list, which I think even Spamhaus would admit is a rough guess at the top spammers. \\nThe first stories about Jaynes cited this source, but now it\\'s simply repeated as if it were part of \\nthe indictment. [4]\\nAll you can say with certainty about Jaynes is that he was a fairly big spammer. But reporters \\ndon\\'t want to print vague stuff like \"fairly big.\" They want statements with punch, like \"top ten.\" \\nAnd PR firms give them what they want. Wearing suits, we\\'re told, will make us 3.6 percent \\nmore productive.\\nBuzz\\nWher', ' vague stuff like \"fairly big.\" They want statements with punch, like \"top ten.\" \\nAnd PR firms give them what they want. Wearing suits, we\\'re told, will make us 3.6 percent \\nmore productive.\\nBuzz\\nWhere the work of PR firms really does get deliberately misleading is in the generation of \\n\"buzz.\" They usually feed the same story to several different publications at once. And when \\nreaders see similar stories in multiple places, they think there is some important trend afoot. \\nWhich is exactly what they\\'re supposed to think.\\nWhen Windows 95 was launched, people waited outside stores at midnight to buy the first \\ncopies. None of them would have been there without PR firms, who generated such a buzz in \\nthe news media that it became self-reinforcing, like a nuclear chain reaction.\\nI doubt PR firms realize it yet, but the Web makes it possible to track them at work.

Once you know how to read \\nthem, it\\'s straightforward to figure out who the client is. With trend stories, PR firms usually line \\nup one or more \"experts\" to talk about the industry generally. In this case we get three: the NPD \\nGroup, the creative director of GQ, and a research director at Smith Barney. [5] When you get \\nto the end of the experts, look for the client.

Most people who publish online write what they \\nwrite for the simple reason that they want to. You can\\'t see the fingerprints of PR firms all over \\nthe articles, as you can in so many print publications-- which is one of the reasons, though they \\nmay not consciously realize it, that readers trust bloggers more than Business Week.\\nI was talking recently to a friend who works for a big newspaper.

I think the main reason is that the writing online is more honest. Imagine how \\nincongruous the New York Times article about suits would sound if you read it in a blog: The \\nurge to look corporate-- sleek, commanding, prudent, yet with just a touch of hubris on your \\nwell-cut sleeve-- is an unexpected development in a time of business disgrace. The problem \\nwith this article is not just that it originated in a PR firm. The whole tone is bogus. This is the \\ntone of someone writing down to their audience.\\nWhatever its flaws, the writing you find online is authentic.

If you'd proposed at the time \\nthat we go into the e-commerce business, we'd have found the idea terrifying.

As it turns out, VC-backed startups are not that \\nfearsome. They're too busy trying to spend all that money to get software written. In 1995, the e-\\ncommerce business was very competitive as measured in press releases, but not as measured \\nin software. And really it never was.

Once we actually took the plunge into e-commerce, it turned out to be surprisingly easy to \\ncompete.\\nSo why were we afraid? We felt we were good at programming, but we lacked confidence in our \\nability to do a mysterious, undifferentiated thing we called \"business.\" In fact there is no such \\nthing as \"business.\" There\\'s selling, promotion, figuring out what people want, deciding how \\nmuch to charge, customer support, paying your bills, getting customers to pay you, getting \\nincorporated, raising money, and so on.

My friend Robert said his whole \\nresearch group at MIT recently bought themselves Powerbooks. These guys are not the graphic \\ndesigners and grandmas who were buying Macs at Apple's low point in the mid 1990s. They're \\nabout as hardcore OS hackers as you can get.\\nThe reason, of course, is OS X. Powerbooks are beautifully designed and run FreeBSD. What \\nmore do you need to know?\\nI got a Powerbook at the end of last year. When my IBM Thinkpad's hard disk died soon after, it \\nbecame my only laptop.

Hard as this was to believe in the mid \\n90s, the Mac was in its time the canonical hacker's computer.\\nIn the fall of 1983, the professor in one of my college CS classes got up and announced, like a \\nprophet, that there would soon be a computer with half a MIPS of processing power that would \\nfit under an airline seat and cost so little that we could save enough to buy one from a summer \\njob. The whole room gasped. And when the Mac appeared, it was even better than we'd hoped. \\nIt was small and powerful and cheap, as promised. But it was also something we'd never \\nconsidered a computer could be: fabulously well designed.\\nI had to have one. And I wasn't alone.

And I wasn\\'t alone. In the mid to late 1980s, all the hackers I knew were \\neither writing software for the Mac, or wanted to.

If you turned it over, it said \"Inside Macintosh.\" \\nThen came Linux and FreeBSD, and hackers, who follow the most powerful OS wherever it \\nleads, found themselves switching to Intel boxes. If you cared about design, you could buy a \\nThinkpad, which was at least not actively repellent, if you could get the Intel and Microsoft \\nstickers off the front. [1]\\nWith OS X, the hackers are back. When I walked into the Apple store in Cambridge, it was like \\ncoming home. Much was changed, but there was still that Apple coolness in the air, that feeling \\nthat the show was being run by someone who really cared, instead of random corporate deal-\\nmakers.\\nSo what, the business world may say.

Who cares if hackers like Apple again? How big is the \\nhacker market, after all?\\nQuite small, but important out of proportion to its size. When it comes to computers, what \\nhackers are doing now, everyone will be doing in ten years. Almost all technology, from Unix to \\nbitmapped displays to the Web, became popular first within CS departments and research labs, \\nand gradually spread to the rest of the world.\\nI remember telling my father back in 1986 that there was a new kind of computer called a Sun \\nthat was a serious Unix machine, but so small and cheap that you could have one of your own \\nto sit in front of, instead of sitting in front of a VT100 connected to a single central Vax.

Maybe, I \\nsuggested, he should buy some stock in this company. I think he really wishes he\\'d listened.\\nIn 1994 my friend Koling wanted to talk to his girlfriend in Taiwan, and to save long-distance \\nbills he wrote some software that would convert sound to data packets that could be sent over \\nthe Internet. We weren\\'t sure at the time whether this was a proper use of the Internet, which \\nwas still then a quasi-government entity. What he was doing is now called VoIP\\n, and it is a huge \\nand rapidly growing business.\\nIf you want to know what ordinary people will be doing with computers in ten years, just walk \\naround the CS department at a good university. Whatever they\\'re doing, you\\'ll be doing.\\nIn the matter of \"platforms\" this tendency is even more pronounced, because novel software \\noriginates with great hackers, and they tend to write it first for whatever computer they \\npersonally use. And software sells hardware. Many if not most of the initial sales of the A', 'e novel software \\noriginates with great hackers, and they tend to write it first for whatever computer they \\npersonally use.

And why did Bricklin and Frankston write \\nVisiCalc for the Apple II? Because they personally liked it. They could have chosen any \\nmachine to make into a star.\\nIf you want to attract hackers to write software that will sell your hardware, you have to make it \\nsomething that they themselves use. It\\'s not enough to make it \"open.\" It has to be open and \\ngood.\\nAnd open and good is what Macs are again, finally. The intervening years have created a \\nsituation that is, as far as I know, without precedent: Apple is popular at the low end and the \\nhigh end, but not in the middle.

I don't think you need much more than high school math plus a few concepts from \\nthe theory of computation. (You have to know what an n^2 algorithm is if you want to avoid \\nwriting them.)

I learned to think of math as a \\ncollection of formulas that were neither beautiful nor had any relation to my life (despite \\nattempts to translate them into \"word problems\"), but had to be memorized in order to do well \\non tests.\\nOne of the most valuable things you could do in college would be to learn what math is really \\nabout.

All such work tends to be related, in that ideas and techniques from one field \\ncan often be transplanted successfully to others. Even others that seem quite distant. For \\nexample, I write essays the same way I write software: I sit down and blow out a lame version 1 \\nas fast as I can type, then spend several weeks rewriting it.\\nWorking on hard problems is not, by itself, enough.

Closer to fraudulent. \\nThe social sciences are also fairly bogus, because they're so much influenced by intellectual \\nfashions. If a physicist met a colleague from 100 years ago, he could teach him some new \\nthings; if a psychologist met a colleague from 100 years ago, they'd just get into an ideological \\nargument. Yes, of course, you'll learn something by taking a psychology class.

I don\\'t know enough about music to say.\\nYou can skip the social sciences, philosophy, and the various departments created recently in \\nresponse to political pressures. Many of these fields talk about important problems, certainly. \\nBut the way they talk about them is useless.

For \\nexample, I know many people who switched from math to computer science because they \\nfound math too hard, and no one who did the opposite. People don\\'t do hard things gratuitously; \\nno one will work on a harder problem unless it is proportionately (or at least log(n)) more \\nrewarding. So probably math is more worth studying than computer science. By similar \\ncomparisons you can make a graph of all the departments in a university.

There are also two \\npractical problems to consider: jobs, and graduate school.\\nIn theory a liberal education is not supposed to supply job training. But everyone knows this is a \\nbit of a fib. Hackers at every college learn practical skills, and not by accident.\\nWhat you should learn to get a job depends on the kind you want. If you want to work in a big \\ncompany, learn how to hack Blub on Windows. If you want to work at a cool little company or \\nresearch lab, you'll do better to learn Ruby on Linux. And if you want to start your own company, \\nwhich I think will be more and more common, master the most powerful tools you can find, \\nbecause you're going to be in a race against your competitors, and \", \"nd if you want to start your own company, \\nwhich I think will be more and more common, master the most powerful tools you can find, \\nbecause you're going to be in a race against your competitors, and they'll be your horse.\\nThere is not a direct correlation between the skills you should learn in college and those you'll \\nuse in a job. You should aim slightly high in college.\\nIn workouts a football player may bench press 300 pounds, even though he may never have to \\nexert anything like that much force in the course of a game. Likewise, if your professors try to \\nmake you learn stuff that's more advanced than you'll need in a job, it may not just be because \\nthey're academics, detached from the real world. They may be trying to make you lift weights \\nwith your brain.\\nThe programs you write in classes differ in three critical ways from the ones you'll write in the \\nreal world: they're small; you get to start from scratch; and the problem is usually artificial and \\npredetermined. In the rea\", \" classes differ in three critical ways from the ones you'll write in the \\nreal world: they're small; you get to start from scratch; and the problem is usually artificial and \\npredetermined. In the real world, programs are bigger, tend to involve existing code, and often \\nrequire you to figure out what the problem is before you can solve it.\\nYou don't have to wait to leave (or even enter) college to learn these skills. If you want to learn \\nhow to deal with existing code, for example, you can contribute to open-source projects. The \\nsort of employer you want to work for will be as impressed by that as good grades on class \\nassignments.\\nIn existing open-source projects you don't get much practice at the third skill, deciding what \\nproblems to solve. But there's nothing to stop you starting new projects of your own. And good \\nemployers will be even more impressed with that.\\nWhat sort of problem should you try to solve?

I tend to use my inbox as a todo list. But that's like using a screwdriver to open \\nbottles; what one really wants is a bottle opener.\\nGrad School\\nWhat about grad school? Should you go? And how do you get into a good one?\\nIn principle, grad school is professional training in research, and you shouldn't go unless you \\nwant to do research as a career. And yet half the people who get PhDs in CS don't go into \\nresearch. I didn't go to grad school to become a professor. I went because I wanted to learn \\nmore.\\nSo if you're mainly interested in hacking and you go to grad school, you'll find a lot of other \\npeople who \", '.

And if half the people around you are out of their \\nelement in the same way you are, are you really out of your element?\\nThere\\'s a fundamental problem in \"computer science,\" and it surfaces in situations like this. No \\none is sure what \"research\" is supposed to be. A lot of research is hacking that had to be \\ncrammed into the form of an academic paper to yield one more quantum of publication.\\nSo it\\'s kind of misleading to ask whether you\\'ll be at home in grad school, because very few \\npeople are quite at home in computer science. The whole field is uncomfortable in its own skin. \\nSo the fact that you\\'re mainly interested in hacking shouldn\\'t deter you from going to grad \\nschool. Just be warned you\\'ll have to do a lot of stuff you don\\'t like.\\nNumber one w', \"able in its own skin. \\nSo the fact that you're mainly interested in hacking shouldn't deter you from going to grad \\nschool. Just be warned you'll have to do a lot of stuff you don't like.\\nNumber one will be your dissertation. Almost everyone hates their dissertation by the time \\nthey're done with it. The process inherently tends to produce an unpleasant result, like a cake \\nmade out of whole wheat flour and baked for twelve hours. Few dissertations are read with \\npleasure, especially by their authors.\\nBut thousands before you have suffered through writing a dissertation. And aside from that, \\ngrad school is close to paradise. Many people remember it as the happiest time of their lives. \\nAnd nearly all the rest, including me, remember it as a period that would have been, if they \\nhadn't had to write a dissertation.

PhD programs start \\nout as college part 2, with several years of classes. So by the time you face the horror of writing \\na dissertation, you're already several years in. If you quit now, you'll be a grad-school dropout, \\nand you probably won't like that idea. When Robert got kicked out of grad school for writing the \\nInternet worm of 1988, I envied him enormously for finding a way out without the stigma of \\nfailure. \\nOn the whole, grad school is probably better than most alternatives. You meet a lot of smart \\npeople, and your glum procrastination will at least be a powerful common bond. And of course \\nyou have a PhD at the end. I forgot about that. I suppose that's worth something.\\nThe greatest advantage of a PhD (besides being the union card of academia, of course) may \\nbe that it gives you some baseline confidence.

For example, the Honeywell thermostats in my \\nhouse have the most atrocious UI. My mother, who has the same model, diligently spent a day \\nreading the user\\'s manual to learn how to operate hers. She assumed the problem was with \\nher. But I can think to myself \"If someone with a PhD in computer science can\\'t understand this \\nthermostat, it must be badly designed.\"\\nIf you still want to go to grad school after this equivocal recommendation, I can give you solid \\nadvice about how to get in. A lot of my friends are CS professors now, so I have the inside story \\nabout admissions. It\\'s quite different from college. At most colleges, admissions officers decide \\nwho gets in. For PhD programs, the professors do. And they try to do it well, because the \\npeople they admit are going to be working for them.\\nApparently only recommendations really matter at the best scho', \"ets in. For PhD programs, the professors do. And they try to do it well, because the \\npeople they admit are going to be working for them.\\nApparently only recommendations really matter at the best schools. Standardized tests count \\nfor nothing, and grades for little. The essay is mostly an opportunity to disqualify yourself by \\nsaying something stupid. The only thing professors trust is recommendations, preferably from \\npeople they know. [6]\\nSo if you want to get into a PhD program, the key is to impress your professors. And from my \\nfriends who are professors I know what impresses them: not merely trying to impress them. \\nThey're not impressed by students who get good grades or want to be their research assistants \\nso they can get into grad school. They're impressed by students who get good grades and want \\nto be their research assistants because they're genuinely interested in the topic.\\nSo the best thing you can do in college, whether you want to get into grad school or just be \\ngood\", 'd grades and want \\nto be their research assistants because they\\'re genuinely interested in the topic.\\nSo the best thing you can do in college, whether you want to get into grad school or just be \\ngood at hacking, is figure out what you truly like. It\\'s hard to trick professors into letting you into \\ngrad school, and impossible to trick problems into letting you solve them. College is where \\nfaking stops working. From this point, unless you want to go work for a big company, which is \\nlike reverting to high school, the only way forward is through doing what you love.\\nNotes:\\n[1] No one seems to have minded, which shows how unimportant the Arpanet (which became the Internet) was as \\nlate as 1984.\\n[2] This is why, when I became an employer, I didn\\'t care about GPAs.

The idea is to show them how awful the real \\nworld is, so they\\'ll understand how lucky they are to be in college. This plan backfired with the guy who came to work \\nfor us, because he had more fun than he\\'d had in school, and made more that year from stock options than any of \\nhis professors did in salary. So instead of crawling back repentant at the end of the year, he took another year off and \\nwent to Europe.

And for those interested in graphic design, Byrne\\'s Euclid.\\n[5] If you wanted to have the perfect life, the thing to do would be to go to grad school, secretly write your dissertation \\nin the first year or two, and then just enjoy yourself for the next three years, dribbling out a chapter at a time.

Otherwise you\\'ll seem a risky bet to admissions committees, no matter how good you are.\\nWhich implies a surprising but apparently inevitable consequence: little liberal arts colleges are doomed.

I think the idea was to play Karl Rove \\nto the VCs\\' George Bush.\\nI considered it for about four seconds. Work for a VC fund?

And I\\'ve met a lot of arrogant \\npeople. [1]\\nI\\'m not alone in feeling this way, of course.

It\\'s not so much that the business attracts jerks, \\nor even that the power they wield corrupts them. The real problem is the way they\\'re paid.\\nThe problem with VC funds is that they\\'re funds. Like the managers of mutual funds or hedge \\nfunds, VCs get paid a percentage of the money they manage: about 2% a year in management \\nfees, plus a percentage of the gains. So they want the fund to be huge-- hundreds of millions of \\ndollars, if possible. But that means each partner ends up being responsible for investing a lot of \\nmoney. And since one person can only manage so many deals, each deal has to be for multiple \\nmillions of dollars.\\nThis turns out to explain nearly all the characteristics of VCs that founders hate.\\nIt explains why VCs take', \"erson can only manage so many deals, each deal has to be for multiple \\nmillions of dollars.\\nThis turns out to explain nearly all the characteristics of VCs that founders hate.\\nIt explains why VCs take so agonizingly long to make up their minds, and why their due \\ndiligence feels like a body cavity search. [2] With so much at stake, they have to be paranoid.\\nIt explains why they steal your ideas. Every founder knows that VCs will tell your secrets to your \\ncompetitors if they end up investing in them. It's not unheard of for VCs to meet you when they \\nhave no intention of funding you, just to pick your brain for a competitor. This prospect makes \\nnaive founders clumsily secretive. Experienced founders treat it as a cost of doing business. \\nEither way it sucks. But again, the only reason VCs are so sneaky is the giant deals they do. \\nWith so much at stake, they have to be devious.\\nIt explains why VCs tend to interfere in the companies they invest in.

But he's also their man: \\nthese newly installed CEOs always play something of the role of a political commissar in a Red \\nArmy unit. With so much at stake, VCs can't resist micromanaging you.\\nThe huge investments themselves are something founders would dislike, if they realized how \\ndamaging they can be. VCs don't invest $x million because that's the amount you need, but \\nbecause that's the amount the structure of their business requires them to invest.

You just try it.\\nAnd of course giant investments mean giant valuations. They have to, or there\\'s not enough \\nstock left to keep the founders interested. You might think a high valuation is a great thing. Many \\nfounders do. But you can\\'t eat paper. You can\\'t benefit from a high valuation unless you can \\nsomehow achieve what those in the business call a \"liquidity event,\" and the higher your \\nvaluation, the narrower your options for doing that.

You\\'re rolling the dice again, whether you like it or not.\\nBack in 1997, one of our competitors raised $20 million in a single round of VC funding. This \\nwas at the time more than the valuation of our entire company. Was I worried? Not at all: I was \\ndelighted. It was like watching a car you\\'re chasing turn down a street that you know has no \\noutlet.\\nTheir smartest move at that point would have been to take every penny of the $20 million and \\nuse it to buy us. We would have sold. Their investors would have been furious of course. But I \\nthink the main reason they never considered this was that they never imagined we could be had \\nso cheap.

But I \\nthink the main reason they never considered this was that they never imagined we could be had \\nso cheap.

We \\ncould sell ourselves to Yahoo for $50 million, and everyone was delighted. If our competitor had \\ndone that, the last round of investors would presumably have lost money. I assume they could \\nhave vetoed such a deal. But no one those days was paying a lot more than Yahoo. So unless \\ntheir founders could pull off an IPO (which would be difficult with Yahoo as a competitor), they \\nhad no choice but to ride the thing down.\\nThe puffed-up companies that went public during the Bubble didn't do it just because they were \\npulled into it by unscrupulous investment bankers.

But they work for the very best VC funds. And my theory explains why \\nthey\\'d tend to be different: just as the very most popular kids don\\'t have to persecute nerds, the \\nvery best VCs don\\'t have to act like VCs. They get the pick of all the best deals. So they don\\'t \\nhave to be so paranoid and sneaky, and they can choose those rare companies, like Google, \\nthat will actually benefit from the giant sums they\\'re compelled to invest.\\nVCs often complain that in their business there\\'s too much money chasing too few deals.

There is no magically \\ndifficult step that requires brilliance to solve.\\nThe Idea\\nIn particular, you don't need a brilliant idea to start a startup around. The way a startup makes \\nmoney is to offer people better technology than they have now. But what people have now is \\noften so bad that it doesn't take brilliance to do better.\\nGoogle's plan, for example, was simply to create a search site that didn't suck.

Good people can fix bad ideas, but \\ngood ideas can't save bad people. \\nPeople\\nWhat do I mean by good people?

The woman in charge of \\nsales was so tenacious that I used to feel sorry for potential customers on the phone with her. \\nYou could sense them squirming on the hook, but you knew there would be no rest for them till \\nthey\\'d signed up.\\nIf you think about people you know, you\\'ll find the animal test is easy to apply. Call the person\\'s \\nimage to mind and imagine the sentence \"so-and-so is an animal.\" If you laugh, they\\'re not. You \\ndon\\'t need or perhaps even want this quality in big companies, but you need it in a startup.\\nFor programmers we had three additional tests. Was the person genuinely smart? If so, could \\nthey actually get things done? And finally, since a few good hackers have unbearable \\npersonalities, could we stand to have them around?\\nThat last test filters out surprisingly few people.

But the \\nsmarter they are, the less pressure they feel to act smart. So as a rule you can recognize \\ngenuinely smart people by their ability to say things like \"I don\\'t know,\" \"Maybe you\\'re right,\" and \\n\"I don\\'t understand x well enough.\"\\nThis technique doesn\\'t always work, because people can be influenced by their environment.

Hackers should do this even if they \\ndon't plan to start startups, because it's the only real way to learn how to program.

This doesn't work well. Business \\npeople are bad at deciding what to do with technology, because they don't know what the \\noptions are, or which kinds of problems are hard and which are easy. And when business \\npeople try to hire hackers, they can't tell which ones are good. Even other hackers have a hard \\ntime doing that.

But they all said no, so I had \\nto do it myself. And what I discovered was that business was no great mystery. It\\'s not \\nsomething like physics or medicine that requires extensive study. You just try to get people to \\npay you for stuff.\\nI think the reason I made such a mystery of business was that I was disgusted by the idea of \\ndoing it. I wanted to work in the pure, intellectual world of software, not deal with customers\\' \\nmundane problems. People who don\\'t want to get dragged into some kind of work often develop \\na protective incompetence at it. Paul Erdos was particularly good at this.

There are esoteric areas of business that are quite hard, like tax \\nlaw or the pricing of derivatives, but you don't need to know about those in a startup. All you \\nneed to know about business to run a startup are commonsense things people knew before \\nthere were business schools, or even universities.\\nIf you work your way down the Forbes 400 making an x next to the name of each person with \\nan MBA, you'll learn something important about business school.

What you notice in the Forbes 400 are a lot of people with technical backgrounds. Bill \\nGates, Steve Jobs, Larry Ellison, Michael Dell, Jeff Bezos, Gordon Moore. The rulers of the \\ntechnology business tend to come from technology, not business. So if you want to invest two \\nyears in something that will help you succeed in business, the evidence suggests you'd do \\nbetter to learn how to hack than get an MBA. [3]\\nThere is one reason you might want to include business people in a startup, though: because \\nyou have to have at least one person willing and able to focus on what customers want.

There's nothing about knowing how to p\", \" able to focus on what customers want. Some \\nbelieve only business people can do this-- that hackers can implement software, but not design \\nit. That's nonsense. There's nothing about knowing how to program that prevents hackers from \\nunderstanding users, or about not knowing how to program that magically enables business \\npeople to understand them.\\nIf you can't understand users, however, you should either learn how or find a co-founder who \\ncan. That is the single most important issue for technology startups, and the rock that sinks \\nmore of them than anything else.\\nWhat Customers Want\\nIt's not just startups that have to worry about this. I think most businesses that fail do it because \\nthey don't give customers what they want. Look at restaurants. A large percentage fail, about a \\nquarter in the first year. But can you think of one restaurant that had really good food and went \\nout of business?\\nRestaurants with great food seem to prosper no matter what.

But can you think of one restaurant that had really good food and went \\nout of business?\\nRestaurants with great food seem to prosper no matter what. A restaurant with great food can \\nbe expensive, crowded, noisy, dingy, out of the way, and even have bad service, and people will \\nkeep coming. It\\'s true that a restaurant with mediocre food can sometimes attract customers \\nthrough gimmicks. But that approach is very risky. It\\'s more straightforward just to make the food \\ngood.\\nIt\\'s the same with technology. You hear all kinds of reasons why startups fail. But can you think \\nof one that had a massively popular product and still failed?\\nIn nearly every failed startup, the real problem was that customers didn\\'t want the product. For \\nmost, the cause of death is listed as \"ran out of funding,\" but that\\'s only the immediate cause. \\nWhy couldn\\'t they get more funding? Probably because the product was a dog, or never \\nseemed likely to be done, or both.\\nWhen I was trying to t', 'n out of funding,\" but that\\'s only the immediate cause. \\nWhy couldn\\'t they get more funding? Probably because the product was a dog, or never \\nseemed likely to be done, or both.\\nWhen I was trying to think of the things every startup needed to do, I almost included a fourth: \\nget a version 1 out as soon as you can. But I decided not to, because that\\'s implicit in making \\nsomething customers want. The only way to make something customers want is to get a \\nprototype in front of them and refine it based on their reactions.\\nThe other approach is what I call the \"Hail Mary\" strategy. You make elaborate plans for a \\nproduct, hire a team of engineers to develop it (people who do this tend to use the term \\n\"engineer\" for hackers), and then find after a year that you\\'ve spent two million dollars to \\ndevelop something no one wants. This was not uncommon during the Bubble, especially in \\ncompanies run by business types, who thought of software development as something terrifying \\nthat therefore ha', \"\\ndevelop something no one wants. This was not uncommon during the Bubble, especially in \\ncompanies run by business types, who thought of software development as something terrifying \\nthat therefore had to be carefully planned.\\nWe never even considered that approach. As a Lisp hacker, I come from the tradition of rapid \\nprototyping. I would not claim (at least, not here) that this is the right way to write every \\nprogram, but it's certainly the right way to write software for a startup. In a startup, your initial \\nplans are almost certain to be wrong in some way, and your first priority should be to figure out \\nwhere. The only way to do that is to try implementing them.\\nLike most startups, we changed our plan on the fly. At first we expected our customers to be \\nWeb consultants.

But in 1996 that was a hard sell. The middle managers we talked to at \\ncatalog companies saw the Web not as an opportunity, but as something that meant more work \\nfor them.\\nWe did get a few of the more adventurous catalog companies. Among them was Frederick's of \\nHollywood, which gave us valuable experience dealing with heavy loads on our servers. But \\nmost of our users were small, individual merchants who saw the Web as an opportunity to build \\na business. Some had retail stores, but many only existed online. And so we changed direction \\nto focus on these users. Instead of concentrating on the features Web consultants and catalog \\ncompanies would want, we worked to make the software easy to use.\\nI learned so\", \"d so we changed direction \\nto focus on these users. Instead of concentrating on the features Web consultants and catalog \\ncompanies would want, we worked to make the software easy to use.\\nI learned something valuable from that. It's worth trying very, very hard to make technology \\neasy to use. Hackers are so used to computers that they have no idea how horrifying software \\nseems to normal people. Stephen Hawking's editor told him that every equation he included in \\nhis book would cut sales in half. When you work on making technology easier to use, you're \\nriding that curve up instead of down. A 10% improvement in ease of use doesn't just increase \\nyour sales 10%. It's more likely to double your sales.\\nHow do you figure out what customers want? Watch them. One of the best places to do this \\nwas at trade shows.

Which meant we got to watch as they used \\nour software, and talk to them about what they needed.\\nNo matter what kind of startup you start, it will probably be a stretch for you, the founders, to \\nunderstand what users want. The only kind of software you can build without studying users is \\nthe sort for which you are the typical user. But this is just the kind that tends to be open source: \\noperating systems, programming languages, editors, and so on. So if you're developing \\ntechnology for money, you're probably not going to be developing it for people like you.

This is called seed capital.

The main reason was that we feared a brand-name VC firm would stick us with a \\nnewscaster as part of the deal.

The strategic decisions were mostly decisions about \\ntechnology, and we didn\\'t need any help with those.\\nThis was also one reason we didn\\'t go public. Back in 1998 our CFO tried to talk me into it. In \\nthose days you could go public as a dogfood portal, so as a company with a real product and \\nreal revenues, we might have done well.

But it was easy for the meaning to slide over into hiring a lot of people fast.\\nOf the two versions, the one where you get a lot of customers fast is of course preferable. But \\neven that may be overrated. The idea is to get there first and get all the users, leaving none for \\ncompetitors. But I think in most businesses the advantages of being first to market are not so \\noverwhelmingly great. Google is again a case in point. When they appeared it seemed as if \\nsearch was a mature market, dominated by big players who\\'d spent millions to build their \\nbrands: Yahoo, Lycos, Excite, Infoseek, Altavista, Inktomi.

The \\nfounders all learned to do every job in the company. As well as writing software, I had to do \\nsales and customer support. At sales I was not very good. I was persistent, but I didn't have the \\nsmoothness of a good salesman. My message to potential customers was: you'd be stupid not \\nto sell online, and if you sell online you'd be stupid to use anyone else's software.

And not only will they give you this advice for free, they\\'ll pay you.\\nWe officially launched in early 1996. By the end of that year we had about 70 users.

By the \\nend of it, we were so far ahead of our competitors that they never had a hope of catching up. \\nAnd since all the hackers had spent many hours talking to users, we understood online \\ncommerce way better than anyone else.\\nThat\\'s the key to success as a startup. There is nothing more important than understanding \\nyour business. You might think that anyone in a business must, ex officio, understand it. Far \\nfrom it. Google\\'s secret weapon was simply that they understood search. I was working for \\nYahoo when Google appeared, and Yahoo didn\\'t understand search.

I think Yahoo gets that now.\\nGoogle understands a few other things most Web companies still don\\'t. The most important is \\nthat you should put users before advertisers, even though the advertisers are paying and users \\naren\\'t. One of my favorite bumper stickers reads \"if the people lead, the leaders will follow.\" \\nParaph', '\\nthat you should put users before advertisers, even though the advertisers are paying and users \\naren\\'t. One of my favorite bumper stickers reads \"if the people lead, the leaders will follow.\" \\nParaphrased for the Web, this becomes \"get all the users, and the advertisers will follow.\" More \\ngenerally, design your product to please users first, and then think about how to make money \\nfrom it. If you don\\'t put users first, you leave a gap for competitors who do.\\nTo make something users love, you have to understand them. And the bigger you are, the \\nharder that is. So I say \"get big slow.\" The slower you burn through your funding, the more time \\nyou have to learn.\\nThe other reason to spend money slowly is to encourage a culture of cheapness. That\\'s \\nsomething Yahoo did understand.

I was impressed by that. Yahoo\\'s market cap \\nthen was already in the billions, and they were still worrying about wasting a few gigs of disk \\nspace.\\nWhen you get a couple million dollars from a VC firm, you tend to feel rich. It\\'s important to \\nrealize you\\'re not. A rich company is one with large revenues. This money isn\\'t revenue. It\\'s \\nmoney investors have given you in the hope you\\'ll be able to generate revenues. So despite \\nthose millions in the bank, you\\'re still poor.\\nFor most startups the model should be grad student, not law firm. Aim for cool and cheap, not \\nexpensive and impressive.

We had office chairs so cheap that the arms all fell off. This was \\nslightly embarrassing at the time, but in retrospect the grad-studenty atmosphere of our office \\nwas another of those things we did right without knowing it.\\nOur offices were in a wooden triple-decker in Harvard Square. It had been an apartment until \\nabout the 1970s, and there was still a claw-footed bathtub in the bathroom.

We felt like our role was to be impudent underdogs instead of corporate \\nstuffed shirts, and that is exactly the spirit you want.\\nAn apartment is also the right kind of place for developing software. Cube farms suck for that, \\nas you've probably discovered if you've tried it. Ever notice how much easier it is to hack at \\nhome than at work? So why not make work more like home?\\nWhen you're looking for space for a startup, don't feel that it has to look professional. \\nProfessional means doing good work, not elevators and glass walls.

And for a startup location is very important. The key to productivity is for people \\nto come back to work after dinner. Those hours after the phone stops ringing are by far the best \\nfor getting work done. Great things happen when a group of employees go out to dinner \\ntogether, talk over ideas, and then come back to their offices to implement them. So you want to \\nbe in a place where there are a lot of restaurants around, not some dreary office park that's a \\nwasteland after 6:00 PM.

These are \\nthe only places I know that have the right kind of vibe.\\nThe most important way to not spend money is by not hiring people. I may be an extremist, but I \\nthink hiring people is the worst thing a company can do. To start with, people are a recurring \\nexpense, which is the worst kind.

But \\nworst of all, they slow you down: instead of sticking your head in someone\\'s office and checking \\nout an idea with them, eight people have to have a meeting about it. So the fewer people you \\ncan hire, the better.\\nDuring the Bubble a lot of startups had the opposite policy. They wanted to get \"staffed up\" as \\nsoon as possible, as if you couldn\\'t get anything done unless there was someone with the \\ncorresponding job title. That\\'s big company thinking. Don\\'t hire people to fill the gaps in some a \\npriori org chart. The only reason to hire someone is to do something you\\'d like to do but can\\'t.\\nIf hiring unnecessary people is expensive and slows you down, why do nearly all companies do \\nit?

It\\'s not just random people who ask this; even reporters do. And they\\'re going \\nto be a lot more impressed if the answer is a thousand than if it\\'s ten.\\nThis is ridiculous, really. If two companies have the same revenues, it\\'s the one with fewer \\nemployees that\\'s more impressive. When people used to ask me how many people our startup \\nhad, and I answered \"twenty,\" I could see them thinking that we didn\\'t count for much.

In this case they \\nwere mostly negative lessons: don't have a lot of meetings; don't have chunks of code that \\nmultiple people own; don't have a sales guy running the company; don't make a high-end \\nproduct; don't let your code get too big; don't leave finding bugs to QA people; don't go too long \\nbetween releases; don't isolate developers from users; don't move from Cambridge to Route \\n128; and so on.

By 38 you can't take so many risks-- especially if \\nyou have kids.\\nMy final test may be the most restrictive. Do you actually want to start a startup? What it \\namounts to, economically, is compressing your working life into the smallest possible space. \\nInstead of working at an ordinary rate for 40 years, you work like hell for four.

It's probably less, in fact; it just seems like a lot because it's \\ncompressed into a short period. So mainly what a startup buys you is time.

You can do that at any age. [10]\\nThis may sound like bullshit. I'm just a minor, you may think, I have no money, I have to live at \\nhome, I have to do what adults tell me all day long.

That realization hits most people around 23. But I\\'m \\nletting you in on the secret early. So get to work. Maybe you can be the first generation whose \\ngreatest regret from high school isn\\'t how much time you wasted.\\nNotes:\\n[1] A doctor friend warns that even this can give an inaccurate picture. \"Who knew how much time it would take up, \\nhow little autonomy one would have for endless years of training, and how unbelievably annoying it is to carry a \\nbeeper?\"\\n[2] His best bet would probably be to become dictator and intimidate the NBA into letting him play.

And that is worth doing, \\nbecause universities are where a lot of the clumps of smart people are these days.\\n[4] The second biggest regret was caring so much about unimportant things.

Without distractions it's too obvious to your brain that you're not doing \\nanything with it, and you start to feel uncomfortable. If you want to measure how dependent you've become on \\ndistractions, try this experiment: set aside a chunk of time on a weekend and sit alone and think.

They also generally \\nprovide a better education. But try this thought experiment: suppose prep schools supplied the same superior \\neducation but had a tiny (.001) negative effect on college admissions. How many parents would still send their kids to \\nthem?\\nIt might also be argued that kids who went to prep schools, because they've learned more, are better college \\ncandidates.

There are simply no outside forces pushing high school to be \\ngood. The air traffic control system works because planes would crash otherwise.

She had \\nonly been in America for a couple weeks and hadn\\'t seen much of the country yet. She arrived \\nlooking astonished. \"It\\'s so ugly!\"\\nPeople from other rich countries can scarcely imagine the squalor of the man-made bits of \\nAmerica.

How can the richest country in the world look like this?\\nOddly enough, it may not be a coincidence. Americans are good at some things and bad at \\nothers. We're good at making movies and software, and bad at making cars and cities. And I \\nthink we may be good at what we're good at for the same reason we're bad at what we're bad \\nat. We're impatient. In America, if you want to do something, you don't worry that it might come \\nout badly, or upset delicate social balances, or that people might think you're getting above \\nyourself.

It\\'s something they plunge into, working fast and \\nconstantly changing their minds, like a charcoal sketch.\\nIn software, paradoxical as it sounds, good craftsmanship means working fast. If you work \\nslowly and meticulously, you merely end up with a very fine implementation of your initial, \\nmistaken idea. Working slowly and meticulously is premature optimization. Better to get a \\nprototype done fast, and see what new ideas it gives you.\\nIt sounds like making movies works a lot like making software.

And if at the last minute two parts don\\'t quite fit, you can figure out some hack \\nthat will at least conceal the problem.\\nNot so with cars, or cities. They are all too physical. If the car business worked like software or \\nmovies, you\\'d surpass your competitors by making a car that weighed only fifty pounds, or \\nfolded up to the size of a motorcycle when you wanted to park it. But with physical products \\nthere are more constraints.

It seems \\npretentious, or frivolous, or even effeminate. Blue staters think it\\'s \"subjective,\" and red staters \\nthink it\\'s for sissies. So anyone in America who really cares about design will be sailing upwind.\\nTwenty years ago we used to hear that the problem with the US car industry was the workers. \\nWe don\\'t hear that any more now that Japanese companies are building cars in the US. The \\nproblem with American cars is bad design. You can see that just by looking at them.\\nAll that extra sheet metal on the AMC Matador wasn\\'t added by the workers. The problem with \\nthis car, as with American cars today, is that it was designed by marketing people instead of \\ndesigners.\\nWhy do the Japanese make better cars than us?

But in this cas', 'as designed by marketing people instead of \\ndesigners.\\nWhy do the Japanese make better cars than us? Some say it\\'s because their culture \\nencourages cooperation. That may come into it. But in this case it seems more to the point that \\ntheir culture prizes design and craftsmanship.\\nFor centuries the Japanese have made finer things than we have in the West. When you look at \\nswords they made in 1200, you just can\\'t believe the date on the label is right. Presumably their \\ncars fit together more precisely than ours for the same reason their joinery always has. They\\'re \\nobsessed with making things well.\\nNot us. When we make something in America, our aim is just to get the job done. Once we \\nreach that point, we take one of two routes. We can stop there, and have something crude but \\nserviceable, like a Vise-grip. Or we can improve it, which usually means encrusting it with \\ngratuitous ornament. When we want to make a car \"better,\" we stick tail fins on it, or make it \\nlonger, or make the w', 'e, like a Vise-grip. Or we can improve it, which usually means encrusting it with \\ngratuitous ornament. When we want to make a car \"better,\" we stick tail fins on it, or make it \\nlonger, or make the windows smaller, depending on the current fashion.\\nDitto for houses. In America you can have either a flimsy box banged together out of two by \\nfours and drywall, or a McMansion-- a flimsy box banged together out of two by fours and \\ndrywall, but larger, more dramatic-looking, and full of expensive fittings. Rich people don\\'t get \\nbetter design or craftsmanship; they just get a larger, more conspicuous version of the standard \\nhouse.\\nWe don\\'t especially prize design or craftsmanship here. What we like is speed, and we\\'re willing \\nto do something in an ugly way to get it done fast. In some fields, like software or movies, this is \\na net win. \\nBut it\\'s not just that software and movies are malleable mediums.

In those businesses, the \\ndesigners (though they\\'re not generally called that) have more power. Software companies, at \\nleast successful ones, tend to be run by programmers. And in the film industry, though \\nproducers may second-guess directors, the director controls most of what appears on the \\nscreen. And so American software and movies, and Japanese cars, all have this in common: \\nthe people in charge care about design-- the former because the designers are in charge, and \\nthe latter because the whole culture cares about design.\\nI think most Japanese executives would be horrified at the idea of making a bad car. Whereas \\nAmerican executives, in their hearts, still believe the most important thing about a car is the \\nimage it projects. Make a good car? What\\'s \"good?\" It\\'s so subjective.

But it isn\\'t working. \\nAmerican cars continue to lose market share. And the reason is that the customer doesn\\'t want \\nwhat he thinks he wants.\\nLetting focus groups design your cars for you only wins in the short term. In the long term, it \\npays to bet on good design. The focus group may say they want the meretricious feature du \\njour, but what they want even more is to imitate sophisticated buyers, and they, though a small \\nminority, really do care about good design.

[1]\\nBut the just-do-it model does have advantages. It seems the clear winner for generating wealth \\nand technical innovations (which are practically the same thing). I think speed is the reason.

But do we have to choose? Could we have it both ways? Could Americans have nice \\nplaces to live without undermining the impatient, individualistic spirit that makes us good at \\nsoftware? Could other countries introduce more individualism into their technology companies \\nand research labs without having it metastasize as strip malls? I'm optimistic. It's harder to say \\nabout other countries, but in the US, at least, I think we can have both.\\nApple is an encouraging example.

I think we'll \\ngradually see national characters superseded by occupational characters: hackers in Japan will \\nbe allowed to behave with a willfulness that would now seem unJapanese, and products in \\nAmerica will be designed with an insistence on taste that would now seem unAmerican. \\nPerhaps the most successful countries, in the future, will be those most willing to ignore what \\nare now considered national characters, and do each kind of work in the way that works best. \\nRace you.\\nNotes:\\n[1] Japanese cities are ugly too, but for different reasons.

Kerry was smarter and more articulate than Bush, but rather a stiff. And \\nKerry lost.\\nAs I looked further back, I kept finding the same pattern. Pundits said Carter beat Ford because \\nthe country distrusted the Republicans after Watergate.

Four years later, \\npundits said the country had lurched to the right.

In 1984 the charisma gap between Reagan and Mondale was like that \\nbetween Clinton and Dole, with similar results. The first George Bush managed to win in 1988, \\nthough he would later be vanquished by one of the most charismatic presidents ever, because \\nin 1988 he was up against the notoriously uncharismatic Michael Dukakis.\\nThese are the elections I remember personally, but apparently the same pattern played out in \\n1964 and 1972. The most recent counterexample appears to be 1968, when Nixon beat the \\nmore charismatic Hubert Humphrey.

Here I want to examine a more specific \\nquestion: why were the exit polls so wrong?\\nIn Ohio, which Kerry ultimately lost 49-51, exit polls gave him a 52-48 victory. And this wasn't \\njust random error. In every swi\", \"o examine a more specific \\nquestion: why were the exit polls so wrong?\\nIn Ohio, which Kerry ultimately lost 49-51, exit polls gave him a 52-48 victory. And this wasn't \\njust random error. In every swing state they overestimated the Kerry vote. In Florida, which \\nBush ultimately won 52-47, exit polls predicted a dead heat.\\n(These are not early numbers. They're from about midnight eastern time, long after polls closed \\nin Ohio and Florida. And yet by the next afternoon the exit poll numbers online corresponded to \\nthe returns. The only way I can imagine this happening is if those in charge of the exit polls \\ncooked the books after seeing the actual returns. But that's another issue.)\\nWhat happened? The source of the problem may be a variant of the Bradley Effect. This term \\nwas invented after Tom Bradley, the black mayor of Los Angeles, lost an election for governor of \\nCalifornia despite a comfortable lead in the polls. Apparently voters were afraid to say they \\nplanned to vote against \", \"r Tom Bradley, the black mayor of Los Angeles, lost an election for governor of \\nCalifornia despite a comfortable lead in the polls. Apparently voters were afraid to say they \\nplanned to vote against him, lest their motives be (perhaps correctly) suspected.\\nIt seems likely that something similar happened in exit polls this year. In theory, exit polls ought \\nto be very accurate. You're not asking people what they would do. You're asking what they just \\ndid.\\nHow can you get errors asking that? Because some people don't respond. To get a truly \\nrandom sample, pollsters ask, say, every 20th person leaving the polling place who they voted \\nfor. But not everyone wants to answer. And the pollsters can't simply ignore those who won't, or \\ntheir sample isn't random anymore. So what they do, apparently, is note down the age and race \\nand sex of the person, and guess from that who they voted for.\\nThis works so long as there is no correlation between who people vote for and whether they're \\nwillin\", 'tly, is note down the age and race \\nand sex of the person, and guess from that who they voted for.\\nThis works so long as there is no correlation between who people vote for and whether they\\'re \\nwilling to talk about it. But this year there may have been. It may be that a significant number of \\nthose who voted for Bush didn\\'t want to say so.\\nWhy not? Because people in the US are more conservative than they\\'re willing to admit. The \\nvalues of the elite in this country, at least at the moment, are NPR values. The average person, \\nas I think both Republicans and Democrats would agree, is more socially conservative. But \\nwhile some openly flaunt the fact that they don\\'t share the opinions of the elite, others feel a \\nlittle nervous about it, as if they had bad table manners.\\nFor example, according to current NPR values, you can\\'t say anything that might be perceived \\nas disparaging towards homosexuals. To do so is \"homophobic.\" And yet a large number of \\nAmericans are deeply religious, and ', 'ing to current NPR values, you can\\'t say anything that might be perceived \\nas disparaging towards homosexuals. To do so is \"homophobic.\" And yet a large number of \\nAmericans are deeply religious, and the Bible is quite explicit on the subject of homosexuality. \\nWhat are they to do? I think what many do is keep their opinions, but keep them to themselves.\\nThey know what they believe, but they also know what they\\'re supposed to believe. And so \\nwhen a stranger (for example, a pollster) asks them their opinion about something like gay \\nmarriage, they will not always say what they really think.\\nWhen the values of the elite are liberal, polls will tend to underestimate the conservativeness of \\nordinary voters. This seems to me the leading theory to explain why the exit polls were so far off \\nthis year. NPR values said one ought to vote for Kerry. So all the people who voted for Kerry felt \\nvirtuous for doing so, and were eager to tell pollsters they had. No one who voted for Kerry did it \\na', 'is year.

It's a fine thing for schools to teach \\nstudents how to write. But for some bizarre reason (actually, a very specific bizarre reason that \\nI'll explain in a moment), the teaching of writing has gotten mixed together with the study of \\nliterature. And so all over the country, students are writing not about how a baseball team with a \\nsmall budget might compete with the Yankees, or the role of color in fashion, or what constitutes \\na good dessert, but about symbolism in Dickens.\\nWith \", 'e writing not about how a baseball team with a \\nsmall budget might compete with the Yankees, or the role of color in fashion, or what constitutes \\na good dessert, but about symbolism in Dickens.\\nWith obvious results.

And certainly Dickens himself would be more interested in an essay about color \\nor baseball.\\nHow did things get this way? To answer that we have to go back almost a thousand years. \\nBetween about 500 and 1000, life was not very good in Europe. The term \"dark ages\" is \\npresently out of fashion as too judgemental (the period wasn\\'t dark; it was just different), but if \\nthis label didn\\'t already exist, it would seem an inspired metaphor. What little original thought \\nthere was took place in lulls between constant wars and had something of the character of the \\nthoughts of parents with a new baby. The ', ' would seem an inspired metaphor. What little original thought \\nthere was took place in lulls between constant wars and had something of the character of the \\nthoughts of parents with a new baby. The most amusing thing written during this period, \\nLiudprand of Cremona\\'s Embassy to Constantinople, is, I suspect, mostly inadvertantly so.\\nAround 1000 Europe began to catch its breath. And once they had the luxury of curiosity, one of \\nthe first things they discovered was what we call \"the classics.\" Imagine if we were visited by \\naliens. If they could even get here they\\'d presumably know a few things we don\\'t. Immediately \\nAlien Studies would become the most dynamic field of scholarship: instead of painstakingly \\ndiscovering things for ourselves, we could simply suck up everything they\\'d discovered. So it \\nwas in Europe in 1200. When classical texts began to circulate in Europe, they contained not \\njust new answers, but new questions. (If anyone proved a theorem in christian Europe before ', \"vered. So it \\nwas in Europe in 1200. When classical texts began to circulate in Europe, they contained not \\njust new answers, but new questions. (If anyone proved a theorem in christian Europe before \\n1200, for example, there is no record of it.)\\nFor a couple centuries, some of the most important work being done was intellectual \\narchaelogy. Those were also the centuries during which schools were first established. And \\nsince reading ancient texts was the essence of what scholars did then, it became the basis of \\nthe curriculum.\\nBy 1700, someone who wanted to learn about physics didn't need to start by mastering Greek \\nin order to read Aristotle. But schools change slower than scholarship: the study of ancient texts \\nhad such prestige that it remained the backbone of education until the late 19th century. By \\nthen it was merely a tradition. It did serve some purposes: reading a foreign language was \\ndifficult, and thus taught discipline, or at least, kept students busy; it introduced s\", \"te 19th century. By \\nthen it was merely a tradition. It did serve some purposes: reading a foreign language was \\ndifficult, and thus taught discipline, or at least, kept students busy; it introduced students to \\ncultures quite different from their own; and its very uselessness made it function (like white \\ngloves) as a social bulwark. But it certainly wasn't true, and hadn't been true for centuries, that \\nstudents were serving apprenticeships in the hottest area of scholarship.\\nClassical scholarship had also changed. In the early era, philology actually mattered. The texts \\nthat filtered into Europe were all corrupted to some degree by the errors of translators and \\ncopyists. Scholars had to figure out what Aristotle said before they could figure out what he \\nmeant. But by the modern era such questions were answered as well as they were ever going \\nto be. And so the study of ancient texts became less about ancientness and more about texts.\\nThe time was then ripe for the question: if th\", \"uch questions were answered as well as they were ever going \\nto be. And so the study of ancient texts became less about ancientness and more about texts.\\nThe time was then ripe for the question: if the study of ancient texts is a valid field for \\nscholarship, why not modern texts? The answer, of course, is that the raison d'etre of classical \\nscholarship was a kind of intellectual archaelogy that does not need to be done in the case of \\ncontemporary authors. But for obvious reasons no one wanted to give that answer. The \\narchaeological work being mostly done, it implied that the people studying the classics were, if \\nnot wasting their time, at least working on problems of minor importance.\\nAnd so began the study of modern literature. There was some initial resistance, but it didn't last \\nlong. The limiting reagent in the growth of university departments is what parents will let \\nundergraduates study.

Universities with x departments \\nwill subscribe to the journals. Graduate students who want jobs as professors of x will write \\ndissertations about it. It may take a good long while for the more prestigious universities to cave \\nin and establish departments in cheesier xes, but at the other end of the scale there are so \\nmany universities competing to attract students that the mere establishment of a discipline \\nrequires little more than the desire to do it.\\nHigh schools imitate universities.

With \\nthe bizarre consequence that high school students now had to write about English literature-- to \\nwrite, without even realizing it, imitations of whatever English professors had been publishing in \\ntheir journals a few decades before. It's no wonder if this seems to the student a pointless \\nexercise, because we're now three steps removed from real work: the students are imitating \\nEnglish professors, who are imitating classical scholars, who are merely the inheritors of a \\ntradition growing out of what was, 700 years ago, fascinating and urgently needed work.\\nPerhaps high schools should drop English and just teach writing.

Public schools probably \\ncouldn't stop teaching English even if they wanted to; they're probably required to by law. But \\nhere's a related suggestion that goes with the grain instead of against it: that universities \\nestablish a writing major.

But is that more important than that they learn to write well? And are English classes \\neven the place to do it? After all, the average public high school student gets zero exposure to \\nhis artistic heritage. No disaster results. The people who are interested in art learn about it for \\nthemselves, and those who aren't don't. I find that American adults are no better or worse \\ninformed about literature than art, despite the fact that they spent years studying literature in \\nhigh school and no time at all studying art. Which presumably means that what they're taught in \\nschool is rounding error compared to what they pick up on their own.\\nIndeed, English classes may even be harmful.

That principle, like the idea that we \\nought to be writing about literature, turns out to be another intellectual hangover of long \\nforgotten origins. It's often mistakenly believed that medieval universities were mostly \\nseminaries. In fact they were more law schools. And at least in our tradition lawyers are \\nadvocates: they are trained to be able to take either side of an argument and make as good a \\ncase for it as they can. \\nWhether or not this is a good idea (in the case of prosecutors, it probably isn't), it tended to \\npervade the atmosphere of early universities. After the lecture the most common form of \\ndiscussion was the disputation. This idea is at least nominally preserved in our present-day \\nthesis defense-- indeed, in the very word thesis.

For many, perhaps most, graduate \\nstudents, it is stuffing a square peg into a round hole to try to recast one's work as a single \\nthesis.

In theory it seemed that the conclusion of a really good essay ought not to need to \\nsay any more than QED. But when you understand the origins of this sort of \"essay\", you can \\nsee where the conclusion comes from. It\\'s the concluding remarks to the jury.\\nWhat other alternative is there? To answer that we have to reach back into history again, \\nthough this time not so far. To Michel de Montaigne, inventor of the essay.

And so you can\\'t begin with a thesis, because you don\\'t \\nhave one, and may never have one. An essay doesn\\'t begin with a statement, but with a \\nquestion. In a real essay, you don\\'t take a position and defend it. You see a door that\\'s ajar, and \\nyou open it and walk in to see what\\'s inside.\\nIf all you want to do is figure things out, why do you need to write anything, though? Why not \\njust sit and think? Well, there precisely is Montaigne\\'s great discovery. Expressing ideas helps \\nto form them.

Just as inviting people over forces you to clean up your apartment, writing \\nsomething that you know other people will read forces you to think well. So it does matter to \\nhave an audience. The things I've written just for myself are no good. Indeed, they're bad in a \\nparticular way: they tend to peter out.

The answer I got was $12. I went to the next cubicle and told my friend Trevor. \\n\"Twelve!\" he said. He tried to sound indignant, but he didn\\'t quite manage it. He knew as well as \\nI did that our valuation was crazy.\\nYahoo was a special case. It was not just our price to earnings ratio that was bogus. Half our \\nearnings were too. Not in the Enron way, of course. The finance guys seemed scrupulous about \\nreporting earnings. What made our earnings bogus was that Yahoo was, in effect, the center of \\na Ponzi scheme. Investors looked at Yahoo\\'s earnings and said to themselves, here is proof that \\nInternet companies can make money. So ', \"our earnings bogus was that Yahoo was, in effect, the center of \\na Ponzi scheme. Investors looked at Yahoo's earnings and said to themselves, here is proof that \\nInternet companies can make money. So they invested in new startups that promised to be the \\nnext Yahoo. And as soon as these startups got the money, what did they do with it? Buy millions \\nof dollars worth of advertising on Yahoo to promote their brand. Result: a capital investment in a \\nstartup this quarter shows up as Yahoo earnings next quarter—stimulating another round of \\ninvestments in startups.\\nAs in a Ponzi scheme, what seemed to be the returns of this system were simply the latest \\nround of investments in it. What made it not a Ponzi scheme was that it was unintentional. At \\nleast, I think it was. The venture capital business is pretty incestuous, and there were \\npresumably people in a position, if not to create this situation, to realize what was happening \\nand to milk it.\\nA year later the game was up.

Starting in January 2000, Yahoo\\'s stock price began to crash, \\nultimately losing 95% of its value.\\nNotice, though, that even with all the fat trimmed off its market cap, Yahoo was still worth a lot. \\nEven at the morning-after valuations of March and April 2001, the people at Yahoo had \\nmanaged to create a company worth about $8 billion in just six years.\\nThe fact is, despite all the nonsense we heard during the Bubble about the \"new economy,\" \\nthere was a core of truth. You need that to get a really big bubble: you need to have something \\nsolid at the center, so that even smart people are sucked in.

Now anything that became fashionable during the \\nBubble is ipso facto unfashionable. But that\\'s a mistake—an even bigger mistake than believing \\nwhat everyone was saying in 1999. Over the long term, what the Bubble got right will be more \\nimportant than what it got wrong.\\n1. Retail VC\\nAfter the excesses of the Bubble, it\\'s now considered dubious to take companies public before \\nthey have earnings. But there is nothing intrinsically wrong with that idea. Taking a company \\npublic at an early stage is simply retail VC: instead of going to venture capital firms for the last \\nround of funding, you go to the public markets.\\nBy the end of the Bubble, companies going public with no earnings were being derided as \\n\"concept stocks,\" as if it were inherently stupid to invest in them. But investing in concepts isn\\'t \\nstupid; it\\'s what VCs do, and the best of them are far from stu', 'no earnings were being derided as \\n\"concept stocks,\" as if it were inherently stupid to invest in them. But investing in concepts isn\\'t \\nstupid; it\\'s what VCs do, and the best of them are far from stupid.\\nThe stock of a company that doesn\\'t yet have earnings is worth something. It may take a while \\nfor the market to learn how to value such companies, just as it had to learn to value common \\nstocks in the early 20th century. But markets are good at solving that kind of problem. I wouldn\\'t \\nbe surprised if the market ultimately did a better job than VCs do now.\\nGoing public early will not be the right plan for every company. And it can of course be disruptive\\n—by distracting the management, or by making the early employees suddenly rich. But just as \\nthe market will learn how to value startups, startups will learn how to minimize the damage of \\ngoing public.\\n2. The Internet\\nThe Internet genuinely is a big deal. That was one reason even smart people were fooled by \\nthe Bubble. Obviously i', 'ps, startups will learn how to minimize the damage of \\ngoing public.\\n2. The Internet\\nThe Internet genuinely is a big deal. That was one reason even smart people were fooled by \\nthe Bubble. Obviously it was going to have a huge effect. Enough of an effect to triple the value \\nof Nasdaq companies in two years? No, as it turned out. But it was hard to say for certain at the \\ntime. [1]\\nThe same thing happened during the Mississippi and South Sea Bubbles. What drove them \\nwas the invention of organized public finance (the South Sea Company, despite its name, was \\nreally a competitor of the Bank of England). And that did turn out to be a big deal, in the long \\nrun.\\nRecognizing an important trend turns out to be easier than figuring out how to profit from it. The \\nmistake investors always seem to make is to take the trend too literally. Since the Internet was \\nthe big new thing, investors supposed that the more Internettish the company, the better. Hence \\nsuch parodies as Pets.Com.\\nIn fact mo', \" make is to take the trend too literally. Since the Internet was \\nthe big new thing, investors supposed that the more Internettish the company, the better. Hence \\nsuch parodies as Pets.Com.\\nIn fact most of the money to be made from big trends is made indirectly. It was not the railroads \\nthemselves that made the most money during the railroad boom, but the companies on either \\nside, like Carnegie's steelworks, which made the rails, and Standard Oil, which used railroads \\nto get oil to the East Coast, where it could be shipped to Europe.\\nI think the Internet will have great effects, and that what we've seen so far is nothing compared \\nto what's coming. But most of the winners will only indirectly be Internet companies; for every \\nGoogle there will be ten JetBlues.\\n3. Choices\\nWhy will the Internet have great effects? The general argument is that new forms of \\ncommunication always do. They happen rarely (till industrial times there were just speech, \\nwriting, and printing), but when they \", 'ternet have great effects? The general argument is that new forms of \\ncommunication always do. They happen rarely (till industrial times there were just speech, \\nwriting, and printing), but when they do, they always cause a big splash.\\nThe specific argument, or one of them, is the Internet gives us more choices. In the \"old\" \\neconomy, the high cost of presenting information to people meant they had only a narrow range \\nof options to choose from. The tiny, expensive pipeline to consumers was tellingly named \"the \\nchannel.\" Control the channel and you could feed them what you wanted, on your terms. And it \\nwas not just big corporations that depended on this principle. So, in their way, did labor unions, \\nthe traditional news media, and the art and literary establishments. Winning depended not on \\ndoing good work, but on gaining control of some bottleneck.\\nThere are signs that this is changing. Google has over 82 million unique users a month and \\nannual revenues of about three billion dol', \"t on \\ndoing good work, but on gaining control of some bottleneck.\\nThere are signs that this is changing. Google has over 82 million unique users a month and \\nannual revenues of about three billion dollars. [2] And yet have you ever seen a Google ad? \\nSomething is going on here.\\nAdmittedly, Google is an extreme case. It's very easy for people to switch to a new search \\nengine. It costs little effort and no money to try a new one, and it's easy to see if the results are \\nbetter. And so Google doesn't have to advertise. In a business like theirs, being the best is \\nenough.\\nThe exciting thing about the Internet is that it's shifting everything in that direction. The hard \\npart, if you want to win by making the best stuff, is the beginning. Eventually everyone will learn \\nby word of mouth that you're the best, but how do you survive to that point? And it is in this \\ncrucial stage that the Internet has the most effect. First, the Internet lets anyone find you at \\nalmost zero cost. Second, it\", \"you're the best, but how do you survive to that point? And it is in this \\ncrucial stage that the Internet has the most effect. First, the Internet lets anyone find you at \\nalmost zero cost. Second, it dramatically speeds up the rate at which reputation spreads by \\nword of mouth. Together these mean that in many fields the rule will be: Build it, and they will \\ncome. Make something great and put it online. That is a big change from the recipe for winning \\nin the past century.\\n4. Youth\\nThe aspect of the Internet Bubble that the press seemed most taken with was the youth of \\nsome of the startup founders. This too is a trend that will last. There is a huge standard \\ndeviation among 26 year olds. Some are fit only for entry level jobs, but others are ready to rule \\nthe world if they can find someone to handle the paperwork for them.\\nA 26 year old may not be very good at managing people or dealing with the SEC. Those require \\nexperience.

Those require \\nexperience. But those are also commodities, which can be handed off to some lieutenant. The \\nmost important quality in a CEO is his vision for the company's future. What will they build next? \\nAnd in that department, there are 26 year olds who can compete with anyone.\\nIn 1970 a company president meant someone in his fifties, at least. If he had technologists \\nworking for him, they were treated like a racing stable: prized, but not powerful. But as \\ntechnology has grown more important, the power of nerds has grown to reflect it. Now it's not \\nenough for a CEO to have someone smart he can ask about technical matters. Increasingly, he \\nhas to be that person himself.\\nAs always, business has clung to old forms. VCs still seem to want to install a legitimate-looking \\ntalking head as the CEO.

Informality\\nIn New York, the Bubble had dramatic consequences: suits went out of fashion. They made one \\nseem old. So in 1998 powerful New York types were suddenly wearing open-necked shirts and \\nkhakis and oval wire-rimmed glasses, just like guys in Santa Clara.\\nThe pendulum has swung back a bit, driven in part by a panicked reaction by the clothing \\nindustry. But I'm betting on the open-necked shirts. And this is not as frivolous a question as it \\nmight seem. Clothes are important, as all nerds can sense, though they may not realize it \\nconsciously.\\nIf you're a nerd, you can understand how important clothes are by asking yourself how you'd \\nfeel about a company that made you wear a suit and t\", 'an sense, though they may not realize it \\nconsciously.\\nIf you\\'re a nerd, you can understand how important clothes are by asking yourself how you\\'d \\nfeel about a company that made you wear a suit and tie to work. The idea sounds horrible, \\ndoesn\\'t it? In fact, horrible far out of proportion to the mere discomfort of wearing such clothes. \\nA company that made programmers wear suits would have something deeply wrong with it.\\nAnd what would be wrong would be that how one presented oneself counted more than the \\nquality of one\\'s ideas. That\\'s the problem with formality. Dressing up is not so much bad in itself. \\nThe problem is the receptor it binds to: dressing up is inevitably a substitute for good ideas. It is \\nno coincidence that technically inept business types are known as \"suits.\"\\nNerds don\\'t just happen to dress informally. They do it too consistently. Consciously or not, they \\ndress informally as a prophylactic measure against stupidity.\\n6. Nerds\\nClothing is only the most visible ba', \"on't just happen to dress informally. They do it too consistently. Consciously or not, they \\ndress informally as a prophylactic measure against stupidity.\\n6. Nerds\\nClothing is only the most visible battleground in the war against formality. Nerds tend to eschew \\nformality of any sort. They're not impressed by one's job title, for example, or any of the other \\nappurtenances of authority.\\nIndeed, that's practically the definition of a nerd. I found myself talking recently to someone from \\nHollywood who was planning a show about nerds. I thought it would be useful if I explained \\nwhat a nerd was. What I came up with was: someone who doesn't expend any effort on \\nmarketing himself.\\nA nerd, in other words, is someone who concentrates on substance. So what's the connection \\nbetween nerds and technology? Roughly that you can't fool mother nature. In technical matters, \\nyou have to get the right answers. If your software miscalculates the path of a space probe, you \\ncan't finesse your way out \", 'hnology? Roughly that you can\\'t fool mother nature. In technical matters, \\nyou have to get the right answers. If your software miscalculates the path of a space probe, you \\ncan\\'t finesse your way out of trouble by saying that your code is patriotic, or avant-garde, or any \\nof the other dodges people use in nontechnical fields.\\nAnd as technology becomes increasingly important in the economy, nerd culture is rising with it. \\nNerds are already a lot cooler than they were when I was a kid. When I was in college in the \\nmid-1980s, \"nerd\" was still an insult. People who majored in computer science generally tried to \\nconceal it. Now women ask me where they can meet nerds. (The answer that springs to mind is \\n\"Usenix,\" but that would be like drinking from a firehose.)\\nI have no illusions about why nerd culture is becoming more accepted. It\\'s not because people \\nare realizing that substance is more important than marketing. It\\'s because the nerds are \\ngetting rich. But that is not going to cha', \"y nerd culture is becoming more accepted. It's not because people \\nare realizing that substance is more important than marketing. It's because the nerds are \\ngetting rich. But that is not going to change.\\n7. Options\\nWhat makes the nerds rich, usually, is stock options. Now there are moves afoot to make it \\nharder for companies to grant options. To the extent there's some genuine accounting abuse \\ngoing on, by all means correct it. But don't kill the golden goose. Equity is the fuel that drives \\ntechnical innovation.\\nOptions are a good idea because (a) they're fair, and (b) they work. Someone who goes to work \\nfor a company is (one hopes) adding to its value, and it's only fair to give them a share of it. And \\nas a purely practical measure, people work a lot harder when they have options. I've seen that \\nfirst hand.\\nThe fact that a few crooks during the Bubble robbed their companies by granting themselves \\noptions doesn't mean options are a bad idea. During the railroad boom, some execu\", \"'ve seen that \\nfirst hand.\\nThe fact that a few crooks during the Bubble robbed their companies by granting themselves \\noptions doesn't mean options are a bad idea. During the railroad boom, some executives \\nenriched themselves by selling watered stock—by issuing more shares than they said were \\noutstanding. But that doesn't make common stock a bad idea. Crooks just use whatever means \\nare available.\\nIf there is a problem with options, it's that they reward slightly the wrong thing. Not surprisingly, \\npeople do what you pay them to. If you pay them by the hour, they'll work a lot of hours. If you \\npay them by the volume of work done, they'll get a lot of work done (but only as you defined \\nwork). And if you pay them to raise the stock price, which is what options amount to, they'll raise \\nthe stock price.\\nBut that's not quite what you want. What you want is to increase the actual value of the \\ncompany, not its market cap. Over time the two inevitably meet, but not always as quickly as \\n\", 'he stock price.\\nBut that\\'s not quite what you want. What you want is to increase the actual value of the \\ncompany, not its market cap. Over time the two inevitably meet, but not always as quickly as \\noptions vest. Which means options tempt employees, if only unconsciously, to \"pump and \\ndump\"—to do things that will make the company seem valuable. I found that when I was at \\nYahoo, I couldn\\'t help thinking, \"how will this sound to investors?\" when I should have been \\nthinking \"is this a good idea?\"\\nSo maybe the standard option deal needs to be tweaked slightly. Maybe options should be \\nreplaced with something tied more directly to earnings. It\\'s still early days.\\n8. Startups\\nWhat made the options valuable, for the most part, is that they were options on the stock of \\nstartups. Startups were not of course a creation of the Bubble, but they were more visible \\nduring the Bubble than ever before.\\nOne thing most people did learn about for the first time during the Bubble was the startup \\ncre', \" not of course a creation of the Bubble, but they were more visible \\nduring the Bubble than ever before.\\nOne thing most people did learn about for the first time during the Bubble was the startup \\ncreated with the intention of selling it. Originally a startup meant a small company that hoped to \\ngrow into a big one. But increasingly startups are evolving into a vehicle for developing \\ntechnology on spec.\\nAs I wrote in Hackers & Painters, employees seem to be most productive when they're paid in \\nproportion to the wealth they generate. And the advantage of a startup—indeed, almost its \\nraison d'etre—is that it offers something otherwise impossible to obtain: a way of measuring \\nthat.\\nIn many businesses, it just makes more sense for companies to get technology by buying \\nstartups rather than developing it in house. You pay more, but there is less risk, and risk is what \\nbig companies don't want. It makes the guys developing the technology more accountable, \\nbecause they only get paid if \", \" developing it in house. You pay more, but there is less risk, and risk is what \\nbig companies don't want. It makes the guys developing the technology more accountable, \\nbecause they only get paid if they build the winner. And you end up with better technology, \\ncreated faster, because things are made in the innovative atmosphere of startups instead of the \\nbureaucratic atmosphere of big companies.\\nOur startup, Viaweb, was built to be sold. We were open with investors about that from the start. \\nAnd we were careful to create something that could slot easily into a larger company. That is \\nthe pattern for the future.\\n9. California\\nThe Bubble was a California phenomenon. When I showed up in Silicon Valley in 1998, I felt like \\nan immigrant from Eastern Europe arriving in America in 1900. Everyone was so cheerful and \\nhealthy and rich. It seemed a new and improved world.\\nThe press, ever eager to exaggerate small trends, now gives one the impression that Silicon \\nValley is a ghost town.

(I say \"there\" because I moved back to the East Coast after Yahoo. \\nI still wonder if this was a smart idea.)\\nWhat makes the Bay Area superior is the attitude of the people.

Productivity\\nDuring the Bubble, optimistic analysts used to justify high price to earnings ratios by saying that \\ntechnology was going to increase productivity dramatically. They were wrong about the specific \\ncompanies, but not so wrong about the underlying principle. I think one of the big trends we'll \\nsee in the coming century is a huge increase in productivity.\\nOr more precisely, a huge increase in variation in productivity. Technology is a lever. It doesn't \\nadd; it multiplies. If the present range of productivity is 0 to 100, introducing a multiple of 10 \\nincreases the range from 0 to 1000.\\nOne upshot of which is that the companies of the future may be surprisingly small. I sometimes \\ndaydream about how big you could grow a company (in revenues) without ever having more \\nthan ten people. What would happen if you outsourced everything except product development? \\nIf you tried this experiment, I think you'd be surprised at how far you could get.

As Fred Brooks \\npointed out, small groups are intrinsically more productive, because the internal friction in a \\ngroup grows as the square of its size.\\nTill quite recently, running a major company meant managing an army of workers. Our \\nstandards about how many employees a company should have are still influenced by old \\npatterns. Startups are perforce small, because they can't afford to hire a lot of people. But I \\nthink it's a big mistake for companies to loosen their belts as revenues increase. The question is \\nnot whether you can afford the extra salaries. Can you afford the loss in productivity that comes \\nfrom making the company bigger?\\nThe prospect of technological leverage will of course raise the specter of unemployment.

There does seem to be: that in \\nthe coming century, good ideas will count for more. That 26 year olds with good ideas will \\nincreasingly have an edge over 50 year olds with powerful connections. That doing good work \\nwill matter more than dressing up—or advertising, which is the same thing for companies. That \\npeople will be rewarded a bit more in proportion to the value of what they create.\\nIf so, this is good news indeed. Good ideas always tend to win eventually.

So even a small increase in the rate at \\nwhich good ideas win would be a momentous change—big enough, probably, to justify a name \\nlike the \"new economy.\"\\nNotes:\\n[1] Actually it\\'s hard to say now.

As European scholarship gained momentum it became less and less \\nimportant; by 1350 someone who wanted to learn about science could find better teachers than \\nAristotle in his own era. [1] But schools change slower than scholarship.

In the 19th century the \\nstudy of ancient texts was still the backbone of the curriculum.\\nThe time was then ripe for the question: if the study of ancient texts is a valid field for \\nscholarship, why not modern texts? The answer, of course, is that the original raison d'etre of \\nclassical scholarship was a kind of intellectual archaeology that does not need to be done in the \\ncase of contemporary authors. But for obvious reasons no one wanted to give that answer. The \\narchaeological work being mostly done, it implied that those studying the classics were, if not \\nwasting their time, at least working on problems of minor importance.\\nAnd so began the study of modern literature. There was a good deal of resistance at first. The \\nfirst courses in English literature seem to have been offered by the newer colleges, particularly \\nAmerican ones.

But Harvard didn't have a professor of English literature \\nuntil 1876, and Oxford not till 1885. (Oxford had a chair of Chinese before it had one of \\nEnglish.) [2]\\nWhat tipped the scales, at least in the US, seems to have been the idea that professors should \\ndo research as well as teach. This idea (along with the PhD, the department, and indeed the \\nwhole concept of the modern university) was imported from Germany in the late 19th century. \\nBeginning at Johns Hopkins in 1876, the new model spread rapidly.\\nWriting was one of the casualties.

The professors who taught math could be required to do \\noriginal math, the professors who taught history could be required to write scholarly articles \\nabout history, but what about the professors who taught rhetoric or composition? What should \\nthey do research on? The closest thing seemed to be English literature. [3]\\nAnd so in the late 19th century the teaching of writing was inherited by English professors. This \\nhad two drawbacks: (a) an expert on literature need not himself be a good writer, any more than \\nan art historian has to be a good painter, and (b) the subject of writing now tends to be \\nliterature, since that\\'s what the professor is interested in.\\nHigh schools imitate universities.

The seeds of our miserable high school experiences were \\nsown in 1892, when the National Education Association \"formally recommended that literature \\nand composition be unified in the high school course.\" [4] The \\'riting component of the 3 Rs \\nthen morphed into English, with the bizarre consequence that high school students now had to \\nwrite about English literature-- to write, without even realizing it, imitations of whatever English \\nprofessors had been publishing in their journals a few decades before.\\nIt\\'s no wonder if this seems to the student a pointless exercise, because we\\'re now three steps \\nremoved from real work: the students are imitating English professors, who are imitating \\nclassical scholars, who are merely the inheritors of a tradition growing out of what was, 700 \\nyears ago, fascinating and urgently needed work.\\nNo Defense\\nThe other big difference between a real essay and the things they make you write in schoo', \"itors of a tradition growing out of what was, 700 \\nyears ago, fascinating and urgently needed work.\\nNo Defense\\nThe other big difference between a real essay and the things they make you write in school is \\nthat a real essay doesn't take a position and then defend it. That principle, like the idea that we \\nought to be writing about literature, turns out to be another intellectual hangover of long \\nforgotten origins.\\nIt's often mistakenly believed that medieval universities were mostly seminaries. In fact they \\nwere more law schools. And at least in our tradition lawyers are advocates, trained to take \\neither side of an argument and make as good a case for it as they can. Whether cause or effect, \\nthis spirit pervaded early universities. The study of rhetoric, the art of arguing persuasively, was \\na third of the undergraduate curriculum.

It's not just that you miss subtleties \\nthis way. The real problem is that you can't change the question.\\nAnd yet this principle is built into the very structure of the things they teach you to write in high \\nschool.

Why bother? But when \\nyou understand the origins of this sort of \"essay,\" you can see where the conclusion comes \\nfrom. It\\'s the concluding remarks to the jury.\\nGood writing should be convincing, certainly, but it should be convincing because you got the \\nright answers, not because you did a good job of arguing.

As the reader gets smarter, convincing and true become \\nidentical, so if I can convince smart readers I must be near the truth.\\nThe sort of writing that attempts to persuade may be a valid (or at least inevitable) form, but it\\'s \\nhistorically inaccurate to call it an essay.

And for programmers the \\nparadox is even more pronounced: the language to learn, if you want to get a good job, is a \\nlanguage that people don't learn merely to get a job.\\nOnly a few companies have been smart enough to realize this so far. But there is a kind of \\nselection going on here too: they're exactly the companies programmers would most like to \\nwork for. Google, for example. When they advertise Java programming jobs, they also want \\nPython experience.\\nA friend of mine who knows nearly all the widely used languages uses Python for most of his \\nprojects.

But it is not so frivolous as it sounds: \\nwhen you program, you spend more time reading code than writing it. You push blobs of source \\ncode around the way a sculptor does blobs of clay. So a language that makes source code ugly \\nis maddening to an exacting programmer, as clay full of lumps would be to a sculptor.\\nAt the mention of ugly source code, people will of course think of Perl.

I said in some \\nsituations it might be a sign of good things. A throbbing headache is not a good thing, but it can \\nbe a sign of a good thing-- for example, that you're recovering consciousness after being hit on \\nthe head.\\nVariation in wealth can be a sign of variation in productivity. (In a society of one, they're \\nidentical.) And that is almost certainly a good thing: if your society has no variation in \\nproductivity, it's probably not because everyone is Thomas Edison. It's probably because you \\nhave no Thomas Edisons.\\nIn a low-tech society you don't see much variation in productivity. If you have a tribe \", \"tivity, it's probably not because everyone is Thomas Edison.

Whereas when you hand people a complex tool like a computer, the \\nvariation in what they can do with it is enormous.\\nThat's not a new idea. Fred Brooks wrote about it in 1974, and the study he quoted was \\npublished in 1968. But I think he underestimated the variation between programmers. He wrote \\nabout productivity in lines of code: the best programmers can solve a given problem in a tenth \\nthe time. But what if the problem isn't given? In programming, as in many fields, the hard part \\nisn't solving problems, but deciding what problems to solve.

Imagination is hard to measure, but \\nin practice it dominates the kind of productivity that's measured in lines of code.\\nProductivity varies in any field, but there are few in which it varies so much. The variation \\nbetween programmers is so great that it becomes a difference in kind. I don't think this is \\nsomething intrinsic to programming, though. In every field, technology magnifies differences in \\nproductivity. I think what's happening in programming is just that we have a lot of technological \\nleverage. But in every field the lever is getting longer, so the variation we see is something that \\nmore and more fields will see as time goes on.

What motivates them? What do they need to do their jobs? How do you recognize \\nthem? How do you get them to come and work for you?

This isn't quite true. It is true \\nthat all they really care about is doing interesting work. But if you make enough money, you get \\nto work on whatever you want, and for that reason hackers are attracted by the idea of making \\nreally large amounts of money. But as long as they still have to show up for work every day, they \\ncare more about what they do there than how much they get paid for it.\\nEconomically, this is a fact of the greatest importance, because it means you don't have to pay \\ngreat hackers anything like what they're worth.

A great programmer might be ten or a hundred \\ntimes as productive as an ordinary one, but he\\'ll consider himself lucky to get paid three times \\nas much. As I\\'ll explain later, this is partly because great hackers don\\'t know how good they are. \\nBut it\\'s also because money is not the main thing they want.\\nWhat do hackers want? Like all craftsmen, hackers like good tools. In fact, that\\'s an \\nunderstatement. Good hackers find it unbearable to use bad tools. They\\'ll simply refuse to work \\non projects with the wrong infrastructure.\\nAt a startup I once worked for, one of the things pinned up on our bulletin board was an ad from \\nIBM. It was a picture of an AS400, and the headline read, I think, \"hackers despise it.\\'\\' [1]\\nWhen you decide what infrastructure to use for a project, you\\'re not just making a technical \\ndecision. You\\'re also making a social decision, and this may be the more important of the ', \"spise it.'' [1]\\nWhen you decide what infrastructure to use for a project, you're not just making a technical \\ndecision. You're also making a social decision, and this may be the more important of the two. \\nFor example, if your company wants to write some software, it might seem a prudent choice to \\nwrite it in Java. But when you choose a language, you're also choosing a community. The \\nprogrammers you'll be able to hire to work on a Java project won't be as smart as the ones you \\ncould get to work on a project written in Python. And the quality of your hackers probably \\nmatters more than the language you choose. Though, frankly, the fact that good hackers prefer \\nPython to Java should tell you something about the relative merits of those languages.\\nBusiness types prefer the most popular languages because they view languages as standards. \\nThey don't want to bet the company on Betamax. The thing about languages, though, is that \\nthey're not just standards. If you have to move bits over \", \"nguages because they view languages as standards. \\nThey don't want to bet the company on Betamax. The thing about languages, though, is that \\nthey're not just standards. If you have to move bits over a network, by all means use TCP/IP\\n. But \\na programming language isn't just a format. A programming language is a medium of \\nexpression.\\nI've read that Java has just overtaken Cobol as the most popular language. As a standard, you \\ncouldn't wish for more. But as a medium of expression, you could do a lot better. Of all the great \\nprogrammers I can think of, I know of only one who would voluntarily program in Java. And of all \\nthe great programmers I can think of who don't work for Sun, on Java, I know of zero.\\nGreat hackers also generally insist on using open source software. Not just because it's better, \\nbut because it gives them more control. Good hackers insist on control. This is part of what \\nmakes them good hackers: when something's broken, they need to fix it. You want them to feel\", \"it's better, \\nbut because it gives them more control. Good hackers insist on control. This is part of what \\nmakes them good hackers: when something's broken, they need to fix it. You want them to feel \\nthis way about the software they're writing for you. You shouldn't be surprised when they feel \\nthe same way about the operating system.\\nA couple years ago a venture capitalist friend told me about a new startup he was involved with. \\nIt sounded promising. But the next time I talked to him, he said they'd decided to build their \\nsoftware on Windows NT, and had just hired a very experienced NT developer to be their chief \\ntechnical officer. When I heard this, I thought, these guys are doomed. One, the CTO couldn't \\nbe a first rate hacker, because to become an eminent NT developer he would have had to use \\nNT voluntarily, multiple times, and I couldn't imagine a great hacker doing that; and two, even if \\nhe was good, he'd have a hard time hiring anyone good to work for him if the project h\", \"e had to use \\nNT voluntarily, multiple times, and I couldn't imagine a great hacker doing that; and two, even if \\nhe was good, he'd have a hard time hiring anyone good to work for him if the project had to be \\nbuilt on NT. [2]\\nThe Final Frontier\\nAfter software, the most important tool to a hacker is probably his office. Big companies think \\nthe function of office space is to express rank. But hackers use their offices for more than that: \\nthey use their office as a place to think in. And if you're a technology company, their thoughts \\nare your product. So making hackers work in a noisy, distracting environment is like having a \\npaint factory where the air is full of soot.\\nThe cartoon strip Dilbert has a lot to say about cubicles, and with good reason. All the hackers I \\nknow despise them. The mere prospect of being interrupted is enough to prevent hackers from \\nworking on hard problems. If you want to get real work done in an office with cubicles, you have \\ntwo options: work at home, o\", \"The mere prospect of being interrupted is enough to prevent hackers from \\nworking on hard problems. If you want to get real work done in an office with cubicles, you have \\ntwo options: work at home, or come in early or late or on a weekend, when no one else is there. \\nDon't companies realize this is a sign that something is broken? An office environment is \\nsupposed to be something that helps you work, not something you work despite.\\nCompanies like Cisco are proud that everyone there has a cubicle, even the CEO. But they're \\nnot so advanced as they think; obviously they still view office space as a badge of rank. Note \\ntoo that Cisco is famous for doing very little product development in house. They get new \\ntechnology by buying the startups that created it-- where presumably the hackers did have \\nsomewhere quiet to work.\\nOne big company that understands what hackers need is Microsoft. I once saw a recruiting ad \\nfor Microsoft with a big picture of a door. Work for us, the premise was,\", \"id have \\nsomewhere quiet to work.\\nOne big company that understands what hackers need is Microsoft.

And you know, Microsoft is remarkable \\namong big companies in that they are able to develop software in house. Not well, perhaps, but \\nwell enough.\\nIf companies want hackers to be productive, they should look at what they do at home. At \\nhome, hackers can arrange things themselves so they can get the most done. And when they \\nwork at home, hackers don't work in noisy, open spaces; they work in rooms with doors. They \\nwork in cosy, neighborhoody places with people around and somewhere to walk when they \\nneed to mull something over, instead of in glass boxes set in acres of parking lots. They have a \\nsofa they can take a nap on when they feel tired, instead of sitting in a coma at their desk, \\npretending to work. Ther\", \"thing over, instead of in glass boxes set in acres of parking lots. They have a \\nsofa they can take a nap on when they feel tired, instead of sitting in a coma at their desk, \\npretending to work. There's no crew of people with vacuum cleaners that roars through every \\nevening during the prime hacking hours. There are no meetings or, God forbid, corporate \\nretreats or team-building exercises. And when you look at what they're doing on that computer, \\nyou'll find it reinforces what I said earlier about tools. They may have to use Java and Windows \\nat work, but at home, where they can choose for themselves, you're more likely to find them \\nusing Perl and Linux.\\nIndeed, these statistics about Cobol or Java being the most popular language can be \\nmisleading. What we ought to look at, if we want to know what tools are best, is what hackers \\nchoose when they can choose freely-- that is, in projects of their own. When you ask that \\nquestion, you find that open source operating systems already \", \" to know what tools are best, is what hackers \\nchoose when they can choose freely-- that is, in projects of their own. When you ask that \\nquestion, you find that open source operating systems already have a dominant market share, \\nand the number one language is probably Perl.\\nInteresting\\nAlong with good tools, hackers want interesting projects. What makes a project interesting? \\nWell, obviously overtly sexy applications like stealth planes or special effects software would be \\ninteresting to work on. But any application can be interesting if it poses novel technical \\nchallenges. So it's hard to predict which problems hackers will like, because some become \\ninteresting only when the people working on them discover a new kind of solution. Before ITA \\n(who wrote the software inside Orbitz), the people working on airline fare searches probably \\nthought it was one of the most boring applications imaginable. But ITA made it interesting by \\nredefining the problem in a more ambitious way.\\nI th\", \"he people working on airline fare searches probably \\nthought it was one of the most boring applications imaginable.

When Google was founded, the conventional \\nwisdom among the so-called portals was that search was boring and unimportant. But the guys \\nat Google didn't think search was boring, and that's why they do it so well.\\nThis is an area where managers can make a difference. Like a parent saying to a child, I bet \\nyou can't clean up your whole room in ten minutes, a good manager can sometimes redefine a \\nproblem as a more interesting one. Steve Jobs seems to be particularly good at this, in part \\nsimply by having high standards. There were a lot of small, inexpensive computers before the \\nMac. He redefined the problem as: make one that's beautiful. And that probably drove the \\ndevelopers harder than any carrot or stick could.\\nThey certainly delivered. When the\", \"ive computers before the \\nMac. He redefined the problem as: make one that's beautiful. And that probably drove the \\ndevelopers harder than any carrot or stick could.\\nThey certainly delivered. When the Mac first appeared, you didn't even have to turn it on to \\nknow it would be good; you could tell from the case. A few weeks ago I was walking along the \\nstreet in Cambridge, and in someone's trash I saw what appeared to be a Mac carrying case. I \\nlooked inside, and there was a Mac SE. I carried it home and plugged it in, and it booted. The \\nhappy Macintosh face, and then the finder. My God, it was so simple. It was just like ... Google.\\nHackers like to work for people with high standards. But it's not enough just to be exacting. You \\nhave to insist on the right things. Which usually means that you have to be a hacker yourself. \\nI've seen occasional articles about how to manage programmers. Really there should be two \\narticles: one about what to do if you are yourself a programmer, and one\", \"t you have to be a hacker yourself. \\nI've seen occasional articles about how to manage programmers. Really there should be two \\narticles: one about what to do if you are yourself a programmer, and one about what to do if \\nyou're not. And the second could probably be condensed into two words: give up.\\nThe problem is not so much the day to day management. Really good hackers are practically \\nself-managing. The problem is, if you're not a hacker, you can't tell who the good hackers are. A \\nsimilar problem explains why American cars are so ugly. I call it the design paradox. You might \\nthink that you could make your products beautiful just by hiring a great designer to design them. \\nBut if you yourself don't have good taste, how are you going to recognize a good designer? By \\ndefinition you can't tell from his portfolio. And you can't go by the awards he's won or the jobs \\nhe's had, because in design, as in most fields, those tend to be driven by fashion and \\nschmoozing, with actual abilit\", \"n't tell from his portfolio. And you can't go by the awards he's won or the jobs \\nhe's had, because in design, as in most fields, those tend to be driven by fashion and \\nschmoozing, with actual ability a distant third. There's no way around it: you can't manage a \\nprocess intended to produce beautiful things without knowing what beautiful is. American cars \\nare ugly because American car companies are run by people with bad taste.\\nMany people in this country think of taste as something elusive, or even frivolous. It is neither. \\nTo drive design, a manager must be the most demanding user of a company's products. And if \\nyou have really good taste, you can, as Steve Jobs does, make satisfying you the kind of \\nproblem that good people like to work on.\\nNasty Little Problems\\nIt's pretty easy to say what kinds of problems are not interesting: those where instead of solving \\na few big, clear, problems, you have to solve a lot of nasty little ones. One of the worst kinds of \\nprojects is writing\", \"say what kinds of problems are not interesting: those where instead of solving \\na few big, clear, problems, you have to solve a lot of nasty little ones.

To hackers \\nthese kinds of projects are the death of a thousand cuts.\\nThe distinguishing feature of nasty little problems is that you don't learn anything from them. \\nWriting a compiler is interesting because it teaches you what a compiler is. But writing an \\ninterface to a buggy piece of software doesn't teach you anything, because the bugs are \\nrandom. [3] So it's not just fastidiousness that makes good hackers avoid nasty little problems. \\nIt's more a question of self-preservation.

Working on nasty little problems makes you stupid. \\nGood hackers avoid it for the same reason models avoid cheeseburgers.\\nOf course some problems inherently have this character. And because of supply and demand, \\nthey pay especially well. So a company that found a way to get great hackers to work on tedious \\nproblems would be very successful. How would you do it?\\nOne place this happens is in startups. At our startup we had Robert Morris working as a system \\nadministrator. That's like having the Rolling Stones play at a bar mitzvah. You can't hire that kind \\nof talent. But people will do any amount of drudgery for companies of which they're the \\nfounders. [4]\\nBigger companies solve the problem by partitioning the company. They get smart people to \\nwork for them by establishing a separate R&D department where employees don't have to work \\ndirectly on customers' nasty little problems.

[5] In this model, the research department functions \\nlike a mine. They produce new ideas; maybe the rest of the company will be able to use them.\\nYou may not have to go to this extreme. Bottom-up programming suggests another way to \\npartition the company: have the smart people work as toolmakers. If your company makes \\nsoftware to do x, have one group that builds tools for writing software of that type, and another \\nthat uses these tools to write the applications. This way you might be able to get smart people \\nto write 99% of your code, but still keep them almost as insulated from users as they would be \\nin a traditional research department. The toolmakers would have users, but they'd only be the \\ncompany's own developers.

The toolmakers would have users, but they'd only be the \\ncompany's own developers. [6]\\nIf Microsoft used this approach, their software wouldn't be so full of security holes, because the \\nless smart people writing the actual applications wouldn't be doing low-level stuff like allocating \\nmemory. Instead of writing Word directly in C, they'd be plugging together big Lego blocks of \\nWord-language. (Duplo, I believe, is the technical term.)\\nClumping\\nAlong with interesting problems, what good hackers like is other good hackers. Great hackers \\ntend to clump together-- sometimes spectacularly so, as at Xerox Parc. So you won't attract \\ngood hackers in linear proportion to how good an environment you create for them. The \\ntendency to clump means it's more like the square of the environment. So it's winner take all.

At \\nany given time, there are only about ten or twenty places where hackers most want to work, \\nand if you aren't one of them, you won't just have fewer great hackers, you'll have zero.\\nHaving great hackers is not, by itself, enough to make a company successful. It works well for \\nGoogle and ITA, which are two of the hot spots right now, but it didn't help Thinking Machines or \\nXerox. Sun had a good run for a while, but their business model is a down elevator. In that \\nsituation, even the best hackers can't save you.\\nI think, though, that all other things being equal, a company that can attract great hackers will \\nhave a huge advantage. There are people who would disagree with this. When we were making \\nthe rounds of venture capital firms in the 1990s, several told us that software companies didn't \\nwin by writing great software, but through brand, and dominating channels, and doing the right \\ndeals.\\nThey really seemed to believe this, and I think I know why.

I think what a lot of VCs are looking \\nfor, at least unconsciously, is the next Microsoft. And of course if Microsoft is your model, you \\nshouldn't be looking for companies that hope to win by writing great software. But VCs are \\nmistaken to look for the next Microsoft, because no startup can be the next Microsoft unless \\nsome other company is prepared to bend over at just the right moment and be the next IBM.\\nIt's a mistake to use Microsoft as a model, because their whole culture derives from that one \\nlucky break. Microsoft is a bad data point. If you throw them out, you find that good products do \\ntend to win in the market.

That turns out to be \\nvery hard. Even hackers can't tell. I'm pretty sure now that my friend Trevor Blackwell is a great \\nhacker. You may have read on Slashdot how he made his own Segway. The remarkable thing \\nabout this project was that he wrote all the software in one day (in Python, incidentally).\\nFor Trevor, that's par for the course. But when I first met him, I thought he was a complete idiot. \\nHe was standing in Robert Morris's office babbling at him about something or other, and I \\nremember standing behind him making frantic gestures at Robert to shoo this nut out of his \\noffice so we could go to lunch. Robert says he misjudged Trevor at first too.

Apparently when \\nRobert first met him, Trevor had just begun a new scheme that involved writing down everything \\nabout every aspect of his life on a stack of index cards, which he carried with him everywhere. \\nHe'd also just arrived from Canada, and had a strong Canadian accent and a mullet.\\nThe problem is compounded by the fact that hackers, despite their reputation for social \\nobliviousness, sometimes put a good deal of effort into seeming smart. When I was in grad \\nschool I used to hang around the MIT AI Lab occasionally. It was kind of intimidating at first. \\nEveryone there spoke so fast. But after a while I learned the trick of speaking fast. You don't \\nhave to think any faster; just use twice as many words to say everything. \\nWith this amount of noise in the signal, it's hard to tell good hackers wh\", \"e I learned the trick of speaking fast.

I \\ncan't tell, even now. You also can't tell from their resumes. It seems like the only way to judge a \\nhacker is to work with him on something.\\nAnd this is the reason that high-tech areas only happen around universities. The active \\ningredient here is not so much the professors as the students. Startups grow up around \\nuniversities because universities bring together promising young people and make them work \\non the same projects. The smart ones learn who the other smart ones are, and together they \\ncook up new projects of their own.\\nBecause you can't tell a great hacker except by working with him, hackers themselves can't tell \\nhow good they are. This is true to a degree in most fields.

This is true to a degree in most fields. I've found that people who are great \\nat something are not so much convinced of their own greatness as mystified at why everyone \\nelse seems so incompetent. \\nBut it's particularly hard for hackers to know how good they are, because it's hard to compare \\ntheir work. This is easier in most other fields. In the hundred meters, you know in 10 seconds \\nwho's fastest. Even in math there seems to be a general consensus about which problems are \\nhard to solve, and what constitutes a good solution. But hacking is like writing. Who can say \\nwhich of two novels is better? Certainly not the authors.\\nWith hackers, at least, other hackers can tell. That's because, unlike novelists, hackers \\ncollaborate on projects.

I don't know if it's possible to make yourself into one. But it's certainly possible to do \\nthings that make you stupid, and if you can make yourself stupid, you can probably make \\nyourself smart too.\\nThe key to being a good hacker may be to work on what you like. When I think about the great \\nhackers I know, one thing they have in common is the extreme difficulty of making them work on \\nanything they don't want to. I don't know if this is cause or effect; it may be both.\\nTo do something well you have to love it. So to the extent you can preserve hacking as \\nsomething you love, you're likely to do it well.

If you\\'re worried that your current job is rotting your brain, it probably is.\\nThe best hackers tend to be smart, of course, but that\\'s true in a lot of fields. Is there some \\nquality that\\'s unique to hackers? I asked some friends, and the number one thing they \\nmentioned was curiosity. I\\'d always supposed that all smart people were curious-- that curiosity \\nwas simply the first derivative of knowledge. But apparently hackers are particularly curious, \\nespecially about how things work. That makes sense, because programs are in effect giant \\ndescriptions of how things work.\\nSeveral friends mentioned hackers\\' ability to concentrate-- their ability, as one put it, to \"tune out \\neverything outside their own heads.\\'\\' I\\'ve certainly noticed this.

And I\\'ve heard several hackers \\nsay that after drinking even half a beer they can\\'t program at all. So maybe hacking does \\nrequire some special ability to focus. Perhaps great hackers can load a large amount of context \\ninto their head, so that when they look at a line of code, they see not just that line but the whole \\nprogram around it. John McPhee wrote that Bill Bradley\\'s success as a basketball player was \\ndue partly to his extraordinary peripheral vision. \"Perfect\\'\\' eyesight means about 47 degrees of \\nvertical peripheral vision. Bill Bradley had 70; he could see the basket when he was looking at \\nthe floor. Maybe great hackers have some similar inborn ability.

(Whereas Bill, if the rumors of autism are true, knows all too \\nwell.)\\nOne difference I've noticed between great hackers and smart people in general is that hackers \\nare more politically incorrect. To the extent there is a secret handshake among good hackers, \\nit's when they know one another well enough to express opinions that would get them stoned to \\ndeath by the general public. And I can see why political incorrectness would be a useful quality \\nin programming. Programs are very complex and, at least in the hands of good programmers, \\nvery fluid. In such situations it's helpful to have a habit of questioning assumptions.\\nCan you c\", 'ul quality \\nin programming.

So here \\nis my best shot at a recipe. If it is possible to make yourself into a great hacker, the way to do it \\nmay be to make the following deal with yourself: you never have to work on boring projects \\n(unless your family will starve otherwise), and in return, you\\'ll never allow yourself to do a half-\\nassed job. All the great hackers I know seem to have made that deal, though perhaps none of \\nthem had any choice in the matter.\\nNotes:\\n[1] In fairness, I have to say that IBM makes decent hardware.

There\\'s a huge gap between Leonardo and second-rate \\ncontemporaries like Borgognone. You see the same gap between Raymond Chandler and the \\naverage writer of detective novels. A top-ranked professional chess player could play ten \\nthousand games against an ordinary club player without losing once.\\nLike chess or painting or writing novels, making money is a very specialized skill.

No one complains when a few people surpass all the rest at \\nplaying chess or writing novels, but when a few people make more money than the rest, we get \\neditorials saying this is wrong.\\nWhy? The pattern of variation seems no different than for any other skill. What causes people to \\nreact so strongly when the skill is making money?\\nI think there are three reasons we treat making money as different: the misleading model of \\nwealth we learn as children; the disreputable way in which, till recently, most fortunes were \\naccumulated; and the worry that great variations in income are somehow bad for society. As far \\nas I can tell, the first is mistaken, the second outdated, and the third empirically false.

I didn't realize there were \\npower plants out there generating it. Likewise, it doesn't occur to most kids that wealth is \\nsomething that has to be generated. It seems to be something that flows from parents.\\nBecause of the circumstances in which they encounter it, children tend to misunderstand \\nwealth. They confuse it with money. They think that there is a fixed amount of it. And they think \\nof it as something that's distributed by authorities (and so should be distributed equally), rather \\nthan something that has to be created (and might be created unequally).\\nIn fact, wealth is not money.

Wealth is the underlying \", \"an something that has to be created (and might be created unequally).\\nIn fact, wealth is not money. Money is just a convenient way of trading one form of wealth for \\nanother. Wealth is the underlying stuff—the goods and services we buy. When you travel to a \\nrich or poor country, you don't have to look at people's bank accounts to tell which kind you're \\nin. You can see wealth—in buildings and streets, in the clothes and the health of the people.\\nWhere does wealth come from? People make it. This was easier to grasp when most people \\nlived on farms, and made many of the things they wanted with their own hands. Then you could \\nsee in the house, the herds, and the granary the wealth that each family created. It was obvious \\nthen too that the wealth of the world was not a fixed quantity that had to be shared out, like \\nslices of a pie. If you wanted more wealth, you could make it.\\nThis is just as true today, though few of us create wealth directly for ourselves (except for a few \\nvestigial\", 'ad to be shared out, like \\nslices of a pie.

Mostly we create wealth for other people in exchange for money, \\nwhich we then trade for the forms of wealth we want. [1]\\nBecause kids are unable to create wealth, whatever they have has to be given to them. And \\nwhen wealth is something you\\'re given, then of course it seems that it should be distributed \\nequally. [2] As in most families it is. The kids see to that. \"Unfair,\" they cry, when one sibling gets \\nmore than another.\\nIn the real world, you can\\'t keep living off your parents. If you want something, you either have \\nto make it, or do something of equivalent value for someone else, in order to get them to give \\nyou enough money to buy it. In the real world, wealth is (except for a few specialists like thieves \\nand speculators) something you have to create, not some', \"someone else, in order to get them to give \\nyou enough money to buy it.

And \\nsince the ability and desire to create it vary from person to person, it's not made equally.\\nYou get paid by doing or making something people want, and those who make more money are \\noften simply better at doing what people want. Top actors make a lot more money than B-list \\nactors. The B-list actors might be almost as charismatic, but when people go to the theater and \\nlook at the list of movies playing, they want that extra oomph that the big stars have.\\nDoing what people want is not the only way to get money, of course.

[3] Basketball players make about 128 times as much, and baseball \\nplayers 72 times as much. Editorials quote this kind of statistic with horror. But I have no trouble \\nimagining that one person could be 100 times as productive as another. In ancient Rome the \\nprice of slaves varied by a factor of 50 depending on their skills.

Depends on what you mean by worth. If you \\nmean worth in the sense of what people will pay for their skills, the answer is yes, apparently.\\nA few CEOs\\' incomes reflect some kind of wrongdoing. But are there not others whose incomes \\nreally do reflect the wealth they generate? Steve Jobs saved a company that was in a terminal \\ndecline.

And regardless of \\nthe case with CEOs, it's hard to see how anyone could argue that the salaries of professional \\nbasketball players don't reflect supply and demand.\\nIt may seem unlikely in principle that one individual could really generate so much more wealth \\nthan another. The key to this mystery is to revisit that question, are they really worth 100 of us? \\nWould a basketball team trade one of their players for 100 random people? What would Apple's \\nnext product look like if you replaced Steve Jobs with a committee of 100 random people? [6] \\nThese things don't scale linearly.

In a free market, prices are determined by what buyers want. People like baseball more \\nthan poetry, so baseball players make more than poets. To say that a certain kind of work is \\nunderpaid is thus identical with saying that people want the wrong things.\\nWell, of course people want the wrong things. It seems odd to be surprised by that. And it \\nseems even odder to say that it\\'s unjust that certain kinds of work are underpaid. [7] Then \\nyou\\'re saying that it\\'s unjust that people want the wrong things. It\\'s lamentable that people \\nprefer reality TV and corndogs to Shakespeare and steamed vegetables, but unjust?

Why else would this idea occur in this odd context? Whereas if the speaker were still \\noperating on the Daddy Model, and saw wealth as something that flowed from a common \\nsource and had to be shared out, rather than something generated by doing what other people \\nwanted, this is exactly what you\\'d get on noticing that some people made much more than \\nothers.\\nWhen we talk about \"unequal distribution of income,\" we should also ask, where does that \\nincome come from? [8] Who made the wealth it represents? Because to the extent that income \\nvaries simply according to how much wealth people create, the distribution may be unequal, but \\nit\\'s hardly unjust.\\nStealing It\\nThe second reason we tend to find great disparities of wealth alarming is that ', \"simply according to how much wealth people create, the distribution may be unequal, but \\nit's hardly unjust.\\nStealing It\\nThe second reason we tend to find great disparities of wealth alarming is that for most of \\nhuman history the usual way to accumulate a fortune was to steal it: in pastoral societies by \\ncattle raiding; in agricultural societies by appropriating others' estates in times of war, and \\ntaxing them in times of peace.\\nIn conflicts, those on the winning side would receive the estates confiscated from the losers. In \\nEngland in the 1060s, when William the Conqueror distributed the estates of the defeated \\nAnglo-Saxon nobles to his followers, the conflict was military. By the 1530s, when Henry VIII \\ndistributed the estates of the monasteries to his followers, it was mostly political. [9] But the \\nprinciple was the same.

[9] But the \\nprinciple was the same. Indeed, the same principle is at work now in Zimbabwe.\\nIn more organized societies, like China, the ruler and his officials used taxation instead of \\nconfiscation. But here too we see the same principle: the way to get rich was not to create \\nwealth, but to serve a ruler powerful enough to appropriate it.\\nThis started to change in Europe with the rise of the middle class. Now we think of the middle \\nclass as people who are neither rich nor poor, but originally they were a distinct group. In a \\nfeudal society, there are just two classes: a warrior aristocracy, and the serfs who work their \\nestates. The middle class were a new, third group who lived in towns and supported themselves \\nby manufacturing and trade.\\nStarting in the tenth and eleventh centuries, petty nobles and former serfs banded together in \\ntowns that gradually became powerful enough to ignore the local feudal lords.

[10] Like serfs, \\nthe middle class made a living largely by creating wealth. (In port cities like Genoa and Pisa, \\nthey also engaged in piracy.) But unlike serfs they had an incentive to create a lot of it. Any \\nwealth a serf created belonged to his master. There was not much point in making more than \\nyou could hide. Whereas the independence of the townsmen allowed them to keep whatever \\nwealth they created.\\nOnce it became possible to get rich by creating wealth, society as a whole started to get richer \\nvery rapidly. Nearly everything we have was created by the middle class. Indeed, the other two \\nclasses have effectively disappeared in industrial societies, and their names been given to \\neither end of the middle class. (In the original sense of the word, Bill Gates is middle class.)\\nBut it was not till the Industrial Revolution that wealth creation ', 'ies, and their names been given to \\neither end of the middle class. (In the original sense of the word, Bill Gates is middle class.)\\nBut it was not till the Industrial Revolution that wealth creation definitively replaced corruption as \\nthe best way to get rich. In England, at least, corruption only became unfashionable (and in fact \\nonly started to be called \"corruption\") when there started to be other, faster ways to get rich.\\nSeventeenth-century England was much like the third world today, in that government office \\nwas a recognized route to wealth. The great fortunes of that time still derived more from what \\nwe would now call corruption than from commerce. [11] By the nineteenth century that had \\nchanged. There continued to be bribes, as there still are everywhere, but politics had by then \\nbeen left to men who were driven more by vanity than greed.

Technology had made it possible \\nto create wealth faster than you could steal it. The prototypical rich man of the nineteenth \\ncentury was not a courtier but an industrialist.\\nWith the rise of the middle class, wealth stopped being a zero-sum game. Jobs and Wozniak \\ndidn\\'t have to make us poor to make themselves rich. Quite the opposite: they created things \\nthat made our lives materially richer. They had to, or we wouldn\\'t have paid for them.\\nBut since for most of the world\\'s history the main route to wealth was to steal it, we tend to be \\nsuspicious of rich people. Idealistic undergraduates find their unconsciously preserved child\\'s \\nmodel of wealth confirmed by eminent writers of the past. It is a case of the mistaken meeting \\nthe outdated.\\n\"Behind every great fortune, there is a crime,\" Balzac wrote. Except he didn\\'t.

If we were talking about Europe in 1000, or most of the \\nthird world today, the standard misquotation would be spot on. But Balzac lived in nineteenth-\\ncentury France, where the Industrial Revolution was well advanced. He knew you could make a \\nfortune without stealing it. After all, he did himself, as a popular novelist. [12]\\nOnly a few countries (by no coincidence, the richest ones) have reached this stage. In most, \\ncorruption still has the upper hand. In most, the fastest way to get wealth is by stealing it.

It will certainly increase the gap \\nbetween the productive and the unproductive. That's the whole point of technology. With a \\ntractor an energetic farmer could plow six times as much land in a day as he could with a team \\nof horses. But only if he mastered a new kind of farming.\\nI've seen the lever of technology grow visibly in my own time. In high school I made money by \\nmowing lawns and scooping ice cream at Baskin-Robbins. This was the only kind of work \\navailable at the time.

But only \\nsome of them will; the rest will still be scooping ice cream.\\nI remember very vividly when in 1985 improved technology made it possib\", \"gh school kids could write software or design web sites.

Within months I was using it to make money as a freelance programmer. \\nA few years before, I couldn't have done this. A few years before, there was no such thing as a \\nfreelance programmer. But Apple created wealth, in the form of powerful, inexpensive \\ncomputers, and programmers immediately set to work using it to create more.\\nAs this example suggests, the rate at which technology increases our productive capacity is \\nprobably exponential, rather than linear. So we should expect to see ever-increasing variation in \\nindividual productivity as time goes on. Will that increase the gap between rich and the poor? \\nDepends which gap you mean.\\nTechnology should increase the gap in income, but it seems to decrease other gaps.

A hundred \\nyears ago, the rich led a different kind of life from ordinary people.

Now, thanks to \\ntechnology, the rich live more like the average person.\\nCars are a good example of why. It's possible to buy expensive, handmade cars that cost \\nhundreds of thousands of dollars. But there is not much point. Companies make more money by \\nbuilding a large number of ordinary cars than a small number of expensive ones. So a company \\nmaking a mass-produced car can afford to spend a lot more on its design. If you buy a custom-\\nmade car, something will always be breaking. The only point of buying one now is to advertise \\nthat you can.\\nOr\", \"g a mass-produced car can afford to spend a lot more on its design. If you buy a custom-\\nmade car, something will always be breaking. The only point of buying one now is to advertise \\nthat you can.\\nOr consider watches. Fifty years ago, by spending a lot of money on a watch you could get \\nbetter performance. When watches had mechanical movements, expensive watches kept better \\ntime. Not any more. Since the invention of the quartz movement, an ordinary Timex is more \\naccurate than a Patek Philippe costing hundreds of thousands of dollars. [13] Indeed, as with \\nexpensive cars, if you're determined to spend a lot of money on a watch, you have to put up \\nwith some inconvenience to do it: as well as keeping worse time, mechanical watches have to \\nbe wound.\\nThe only thing technology can't cheapen is brand.

Now even the \\npoorest Americans drive cars, and it is only because we're so well trained by advertising that \\nwe can even recognize the especially expensive ones. [14]\\nThe same pattern has played out in industry after industry. If there is enough demand for \\nsomething, technology will make it cheap enough to sell in large volumes, and the mass-\\nproduced versions will be, if not better, at least more convenient.

Their \\nhouses are in different neighborhoods, or if in the same neighborhood are different sizes, but \\nwithin them life is similar. The houses are made using the same construction techniques and \\ncontain much the same objects. It\\'s inconvenient to do something expensive and custom.\\nThe rich spend their time more like everyone else too. Bertie Wooster seems long gone. Now, \\nmost people who are rich enough not to work do anyway. It\\'s not just social pressure that \\nmakes them; idleness is lonely and demoralizing.\\nNor do we have the social distinctions there were a hundred years ago.

You\\'d seem a \\nbarbarian if you behaved that way today. You\\'d also have a very boring life. People still tend to \\nsegregate themselves somewhat, but much more on the basis of education than wealth.

So on average such a hacker must be able to \\ndo at least $80,000 worth of work per year for the company just to break even. You could \\nprobably work twice as many hours as a corporate employee, and if you focus you can probably \\nget three times as much done in an hour.

[2] If a fairly good hacker is worth $80,000 a year at a big company, then a smart \\nhacker working very hard without any corporate bullshit to slow him down should be able to do \\nwork worth about $3 million a year.\\nLike all back-of-the-envelope calculations, this one has a lot of wiggle room. I wouldn't try to \\ndefend the actual numbers. But I stand by the structure of the calculation. I'm not claiming the \\nmultiplier is precisely 36, but it is certainly more than 10, and probably rarely as high as 100.\\nIf $3 million a year seems high, remember that we're talking about the limit case: the case \\nwhere you not only have zero leisure time but indeed work so hard that you endanger your \\nhealth.\\nS\", \"as 100.\\nIf $3 million a year seems high, remember that we're talking about the limit case: the case \\nwhere you not only have zero leisure time but indeed work so hard that you endanger your \\nhealth.\\nStartups are not magic. They don't change the laws of wealth creation. They just represent a \\npoint at the far end of the curve. There is a conservation law at work here: if you want to make a \\nmillion dollars, you have to endure a million dollars' worth of pain. For example, one way to \\nmake a million dollars would be to work for the Post Office your whole life, and save every \\npenny of your salary. Imagine the stress of working for the Post Office for fifty years. In a startup \\nyou compress all this stress into three or four years.

[3] Wealth is as old as human history. Far older, in fact; ants have wealth. Money is a \\ncomparatively recent invention.\\nWealth is the fundamental thing. Wealth is stuff we want: food, clothes, houses, cars, gadgets, \\ntravel to interesting places, and so on. You can have wealth without having money. If you had a \\nmagic machine that could on command make you a car or cook you dinner or do your laundry, \\nor do anything else you wanted, you wouldn't need money. Whereas if you were i\", \"ut having money. If you had a \\nmagic machine that could on command make you a car or cook you dinner or do your laundry, \\nor do anything else you wanted, you wouldn't need money. Whereas if you were in the middle of \\nAntarctica, where there is nothing to buy, it wouldn't matter how much money you had.\\nWealth is what you want, not money. But if wealth is the important thing, why does everyone \\ntalk about making money? It is a kind of shorthand: money is a way of moving wealth, and in \\npractice they are usually interchangeable. But they are not the same thing, and unless you plan \\nto get rich by counterfeiting, talking about making money can make it harder to understand how \\nto make money.\\nMoney is a side effect of specialization. In a specialized society, most of the things you need, \\nyou can't make for yourself. If you want a potato or a pencil or a place to live, you have to get it \\nfrom someone else.\\nHow do you get the person who grows the potatoes to give you some?

If you make violins, and none of the local farmers wants one, how will you eat?\\nThe solution societies find, as they get more specialized, is to make the trade into a two-step \\nprocess. Instead of trading violins directly for potatoes, you trade violins for, say, silver, which \\nyou can then trade again for anything else you need.

There is, in any normal family, a fixed amount of money at any moment. But \\nthat\\'s not the same thing.\\nWhen wealth is talked about in this context, it is often described as a pie. \"You can\\'t make the \\npie larger,\" say politicians.

When you\\'re talking about the amount of money in one family\\'s bank \\naccount, or the amount available to a government from one year\\'s tax revenue, this is true. If \\none person gets more, someone else has to get less.\\nI can remember believing, as a child, that if a few rich people had all the money, it left less for \\neveryone else. Many people seem to continue to believe something like this well into adulthood. \\nThis fallacy is usually there in the background when you hear someone talking about how x \\npercent of the population have y percent of the wealth. If you plan to start a startup, then \\nwhether you realize it or not, you\\'re planning to disprove the Pie Fallacy.\\nWhat leads people astray here is the abstraction of money. Money is not wealth.

[5b]\\nEveryone in a company works together to create wealth, in the sense of making more things \\npeople want. Many of the employees (e.g. the people in the mailroom or the personnel \\ndepartment) work at one remove from the actual making of stuff. Not the programmers. They \\nliterally think the product, one line at a time. And so it's clearer to programmers that wealth is \\nsomething that's made, rather than being distributed, like slices of a\", \"f. Not the programmers. They \\nliterally think the product, one line at a time. And so it's clearer to programmers that wealth is \\nsomething that's made, rather than being distributed, like slices of a pie, by some imaginary \\nDaddy.\\nIt's also obvious to programmers that there are huge variations in the rate at which wealth is \\ncreated. At Viaweb we had one programmer who was a sort of monster of productivity. I \\nremember watching what he did one long day and estimating that he had added several \\nhundred thousand dollars to the market value of the company. A great programmer, on a roll, \\ncould create a million dollars worth of wealth in a couple weeks. A mediocre programmer over \\nthe same period will generate zero or even negative wealth (e.g. by introducing bugs).\\nThis is why so many of the best programmers are libertarians. In our world, you sink or swim, \\nand there are no excuses. When those far removed from the creation of wealth-- \\nundergraduates, reporters, politicians-- hear that \", \" best programmers are libertarians. In our world, you sink or swim, \\nand there are no excuses. When those far removed from the creation of wealth-- \\nundergraduates, reporters, politicians-- hear that the richest 5% of the people have half the total \\nwealth, they tend to think injustice! An experienced programmer would be more likely to think is \\nthat all? The top 5% of programmers probably write 99% of the good software.\\nWealth can be created without being sold. Scientists, till recently at least, effectively donated \\nthe wealth they created. We are all richer for knowing about penicillin, because we're less likely \\nto die from infections. Wealth is whatever people want, and not dying is certainly something we \\nwant. Hackers often donate their work by writing open source software that anyone can use for \\nfree. I am much the richer for the operating system FreeBSD, which I'm running on the \\ncomputer I'm using now, and so is Yahoo, which runs it on all their servers.\\nWhat a Job Is\\nIn ind\", \"ne can use for \\nfree.

After all those years you get used to the idea of belonging to a group of people who all \\nget up in the morning, go to some set of buildings, and do things that they do not, ordinarily, \\nenjoy doing. Belonging to such a group becomes part of your identity: name, age, role, \\ninstitution. If you have to introduce yourself, or someone else describes you, it will be as \\nsomething like, John Smith, age 10, a student at such and such elementary school, or John \\nSmith, age 20, a student at such and such college.\\nWhen John Smith finishes school he is expected to get a job. And what getting a job seems to \\nmean is joining another institution. Superficially it's a lot like college.

Superficially it's a lot like college. You pick the companies \\nyou want to work for and apply to join them. If one likes you, you become a member of this new \\ngroup. You get up in the morning and go to a new set of buildings, and do things that you do \\nnot, ordinarily, enjoy doing. There are a few differences: life is not as much fun, and you get \\npaid, instead of paying, as you did in college. But the similarities feel greater than the \\ndifferences. John Smith is now John Smith, 22, a software developer at such and such \\ncorporation.\\nIn fact John Smith's life has changed more than he realizes. Socially, a company looks much \\nlike college, but the deeper you go into the underlying reality, the more different it gets.\\nWhat a company does, and has to do if it wants to continue to exist, is earn money.

And the way \\nmost companies make money is by creating wealth. Companies can be so specialized that this \\nsimilarity is concealed, but it is not only manufacturing companies that create wealth. A big \\ncomponent of wealth is location. Remember that magic machine that could make you cars and \\ncook you dinner and so on? It would not be so useful if it delivered your dinner to a random \\nlocation in central Asia. If wealth means what people want, companies that move things also \\ncreate wealth. Ditto for many other kinds of companies that don't make anything physical. \\nNearly all companies exist to do something people want.\\nAnd that's what you do, as well, when you go to work for a company. But here there is another \\nlayer that tends to obscure the underlying reality.

But here there is another \\nlayer that tends to obscure the underlying reality. In a company, the work you do is averaged \\ntogether with a lot of other people's. You may not even be aware you're doing something people \\nwant. Your contribution may be indirect. But the company as a whole must be giving people \\nsomething they want, or they won't make any money. And if they are paying you x dollars a \\nyear, then on average you must be contributing at least x dollars a year worth of work, or the \\ncompany will be spending more than it makes, and will go out of business.\\nSomeone graduating from college thinks, and is told, that he needs to get a job, as if the \\nimportant thing were becoming a member of an institution. A more direct way to put it would be: \\nyou need to start doing something people want. You don't need to join a company to do that. All \\na company is is a group of people working together to do something people want. It's doing \\nsomethi\", \"e: \\nyou need to start doing something people want. You don't need to join a company to do that. All \\na company is is a group of people working together to do something people want.

But it is a \\ngood idea to understand what's happening when you do this. A job means doing something \\npeople want, averaged together with everyone else in that company.\\nWorking Harder\\nThat averaging gets to be a problem. I think the single biggest problem afflicting large \\ncompanies is the difficulty of assigning a value to each person's work. For the most part they \\npunt. In a big company you get paid a fairly predictable salary for working fairly hard. You're \\nexpected not to be obviously incompetent or lazy, but you're not expected to devote your whole \\nlife to your work.\\nIt turns out, though, that there are economies of scale in how much of your life\", \"'re \\nexpected not to be obviously incompetent or lazy, but you're not expected to devote your whole \\nlife to your work.\\nIt turns out, though, that there are economies of scale in how much of your life you devote to \\nyour work. In the right kind of business, someone who really devoted himself to work could \\ngenerate ten or even a hundred times as much wealth as an average employee. A programmer, \\nfor example, instead of chugging along maintaining and updating an existing piece of software, \\ncould write a whole new piece of software, and with it create a new source of revenue.\\nCompanies are not set up to reward people who want to do this. You can't go to your boss and \\nsay, I'd like to start working ten times as hard, so will you please pay me ten times as much? \\nFor one thing, the official fiction is that you are already working as hard as you can. But a more \\nserious problem is that the company has no way of measuring the value of your work.\\nSalesmen are an exception. It's easy to meas\", \"fiction is that you are already working as hard as you can. But a more \\nserious problem is that the company has no way of measuring the value of your work.\\nSalesmen are an exception. It's easy to measure how much revenue they generate, and they're \\nusually paid a percentage of it. If a salesman wants to work harder, he can just start doing it, \\nand he will automatically get paid proportionally more.\\nThere is one other job besides sales where big companies can hire first-rate people: in the top \\nmanagement jobs. And for the same reason: their performance can be measured. The top \\nmanagers are held responsible for the performance of the entire company. Because an ordinary \\nemployee's performance can't usually be measured, he is not expected to do more than put in a \\nsolid effort. Whereas top management, like salespeople, have to actually come up with the \\nnumbers. The CEO of a company that tanks cannot plead that he put in a solid effort.

The CEO of a company that tanks cannot plead that he put in a solid effort. If the \\ncompany does badly, he's done badly.\\nA company that could pay all its employees so straightforwardly would be enormously \\nsuccessful. Many employees would work harder if they could get paid for it. More importantly, \\nsuch a company would attract people who wanted to work especially hard. It would crush its \\ncompetitors.\\nUnfortunately, companies can't pay everyone like salesmen. Salesmen work alone. Most \\nemployees' work is tangled together. Suppose a company makes some kind of consumer \\ngadget. The engineers build a reliable gadget with all kinds of new features; the industrial \\ndesigners design a beautiful case for it; and then the marketing people convince everyone that \\nit's something they've got to have. How do you know how much of the gadget's sales are due to \\neach group's efforts?

How do you know how much of the gadget's sales are due to \\neach group's efforts? Or, for that matter, how much is due to the creators of past gadgets that \\ngave the company a reputation for quality? There's no way to untangle all their contributions. \\nEven if you could read the minds of the consumers, you'd find these factors were all blurred \\ntogether.\\nIf you want to go faster, it's a problem to have your work tangled together with a large number of \\nother people's. In a large group, your performance is not separately measurable-- and the rest \\nof the group slows you down.\\nMeasurement and Leverage\\nTo get rich you need to get yourself in a situation with two things, measurement and leverage. \\nYou need to be in a position where your performance can be measured, or there is no way to \\nget paid more by doing more. And you have to have leverage, in the sense that the decisions \\nyou make have a big effect.\\nMeasurem\", \"osition where your performance can be measured, or there is no way to \\nget paid more by doing more. And you have to have leverage, in the sense that the decisions \\nyou make have a big effect.\\nMeasurement alone is not enough. An example of a job with measurement but not leverage is \\ndoing piecework in a sweatshop. Your performance is measured and you get paid accordingly, \\nbut you have no scope for decisions. The only decision you get to make is how fast you work, \\nand that can probably only increase your earnings by a factor of two or three.\\nAn example of a job with both measurement and leverage would be lead actor in a movie. Your \\nperformance can be measured in the gross of the movie. And you have leverage in the sense \\nthat your performance can make or break it.\\nCEOs also have both measurement and leverage. They're measured, in that the performance of \\nthe company is their performance. And they have leverage in that their decisions set the whole \\ncompany moving in one direction or a\", \"urement and leverage. They're measured, in that the performance of \\nthe company is their performance. And they have leverage in that their decisions set the whole \\ncompany moving in one direction or another.\\nI think everyone who gets rich by their own efforts will be found to be in a situation with \\nmeasurement and leverage. Everyone I can think of does: CEOs, movie stars, hedge fund \\nmanagers, professional athletes. A good hint to the presence of leverage is the possibility of \\nfailure. Upside must be balanced by downside, so if there is big potential for gain there must \\nalso be a terrifying possibility of loss. CEOs, stars, fund managers, and athletes all live with the \\nsword hanging over their heads; the moment they start to suck, they're out. If you're in a job that \\nfeels safe, you are not going to get rich, because if there is no danger there is almost certainly \\nno leverage.\\nBut you don't have to become a CEO or a movie star to be in a situation with measurement and \\nleverage. \", \"re not going to get rich, because if there is no danger there is almost certainly \\nno leverage.\\nBut you don't have to become a CEO or a movie star to be in a situation with measurement and \\nleverage. All you need to do is be part of a small group working on a hard problem.\\nSmallness = Measurement\\nIf you can't measure the value of the work done by individual employees, you can get close. You \\ncan measure the value of the work done by small groups.\\nOne level at which you can accurately measure the revenue generated by employees is at the \\nlevel of the whole company. When the company is small, you are thereby fairly close to \\nmeasuring the contributions of individual employees. A viable startup might only have ten \\nemployees, which puts you within a factor of ten of measuring individual effort.\\nStarting or joining a startup is thus as close as most people can get to saying to one's boss, I \\nwant to work ten times as hard, so please pay me ten times as much.

There are two \\ndifferences: you're not saying it to your boss, but directly to the customers (for whom your boss \\nis only a proxy after all), and you're not doing it individually, but along with a small group of \\nother ambitious people.\\nIt will, ordinarily, be a group. Except in a few unusual kinds of work, like acting or writing books, \\nyou can't be a company of one person. And the people you work with had better be good, \\nbecause it's their work that yours is going to be averaged with.\\nA big company is like a giant galley driven by a thousand rowers. Two things keep the speed of \\nthe galley down. One is that individual rowers don't see any result from working harder. The \\nother is that, in a group of a thousand people, the average rower is likely to be pretty average.\\nIf you took ten people at random out of the big ga\", \"wers don't see any result from working harder. The \\nother is that, in a group of a thousand people, the average rower is likely to be pretty average.\\nIf you took ten people at random out of the big galley and put them in a boat by themselves, \\nthey could probably go faster. They would have both carrot and stick to motivate them. An \\nenergetic rower would be encouraged by the thought that he could have a visible effect on the \\nspeed of the boat. And if someone was lazy, the others would be more likely to notice and \\ncomplain.\\nBut the real advantage of the ten-man boat shows when you take the ten best rowers out of the \\nbig galley and put them in a boat together. They will have all the extra motivation that comes \\nfrom being in a small group. But more importantly, by selecting that small a group you can get \\nthe best rowers. Each one will be in the top 1%. It's a much better deal for them to average their \\nwork together with a small group of their peers than to average it with everyone.\\n\", \"roup you can get \\nthe best rowers. Each one will be in the top 1%. It's a much better deal for them to average their \\nwork together with a small group of their peers than to average it with everyone.\\nThat's the real point of startups. Ideally, you are getting together with a group of other people \\nwho also want to work a lot harder, and get paid a lot more, than they would in a big company. \\nAnd because startups tend to get founded by self-selecting groups of ambitious people who \\nalready know one another (at least by reputation), the level of measurement is more precise \\nthan you get from smallness alone. A startup is not merely ten people, but ten people like you.\\nSteve Jobs once said that the success or failure of a startup depends on the first ten \\nemployees. I agree. If anything, it's more like the first five. Being small is not, in itself, what \\nmakes startups kick butt, but rather that small groups can be select.

So all other things being equal, a very able person in a big company is probably getting \\na bad deal, because his performance is dragged down by the overall lower performance of the \\nothers. Of course, all other things often are not equal: the able person may not care about \\nmoney, or may prefer the stability of a large company. But a very able person who does care \\nabout money will ordinarily do better to go off and work with a small group of peers.\\nTechnology = Leverage\\nStartups offer anyone a way to be in a situation with measurement and leverage.

And when you discover a new \\nway to do things, its value is multiplied by all the people who use it. It is the proverbial fishing \\nrod, rather than the fish. That's the difference between a startup and a restaurant or a barber \\nshop. You fry eggs or cut hair one customer at a time. Whereas if you solve a technical problem \\nthat a lot of people care about, you help everyone who uses your solution. That's leverage.\\nIf you look at history, it seems that most people who got rich by creating wealth did it by \\ndeveloping new technology. You just can't fry eggs or cut hair fast enough.

The leading \\nedge of technology moves fast. Technology that's valuable today could be worthless in a couple \\nyears. Small companies are more at home in this world, because they don't have layers of \\nbureaucracy to slow them down. Also, technical advances tend to come from unorthodox \\napproaches, and small companies are less constrained by convention.\\nBig companies can develop technology. They just can't do it quickly. Their size makes them slow \\nand prevents them from rewarding employees for the extraordinary effort required. So in \\npractice big companies \", \"nies can develop technology. They just can't do it quickly. Their size makes them slow \\nand prevents them from rewarding employees for the extraordinary effort required. So in \\npractice big companies only get to develop technology in fields where large capital \\nrequirements prevent startups from competing with them, like microprocessors, power plants, or \\npassenger aircraft. And even in those fields they depend heavily on startups for components \\nand ideas.\\nIt's obvious that biotech or software startups exist to solve hard technical problems, but I think it \\nwill also be found to be true in businesses that don't seem to be about technology. McDonald's, \\nfor example, grew big by designing a system, the McDonald's franchise, that could then be \\nreproduced at will all over the face of the earth.

At Viaweb one of our rules of thumb was run upstairs. Suppose \\nyou are a little, nimble guy being chased by a big, fat, bully. You open a door and find yourself in \\na staircase. Do you go up or down? I say up. The bully can probably run downstairs as fast as \\nyou can. Going upstairs his bulk will be more of a disadvantage. Running upstairs is hard for \\nyou but even harder for him.\\nWhat this meant in practice was that we deliberately sought hard problems.

If there were two \\nfeatures we could add to our software, both equally valuable in proportion to their difficulty, we'd \\nalways take the harder one. Not just because it was more valuable, but because it was harder. \\nWe delighted in forcing bigger, slower competitors to follow us over difficult ground. Like \\nguerillas, startups prefer the difficult terrain of the mountains, where the troops of the central \\ngovernment can't follow. I can remember times when we were just exhausted after wrestling all \\nday with some horrible technical problem. And I'd be delighted, because something that was \\nhard for us would be impossible for our competitors.\\nThis is not just a good way to run a startup. It's what a startup is. Venture capitalists know about \\nthis and have a phrase for it: barriers to entry.

Otherwise as soon as some big company becomes aware of it, they'll \\nmake their own, and with their brand name, capital, and distribution clout, they'll take away your \\nmarket overnight. You'd be like guerillas caught in the open field by regular army forces.\\nOne way to put up barriers to entry is through patents. But patents may not provide much \\nprotection. Competitors commonly find ways to work around a patent. And if they can't, they \\nmay simply violate it and invite you to sue them.

He invented television. The reason you've never heard of him \\nis that his company was not the one to make money from it. [8] The company that did was RCA, \\nand Farnsworth's reward for his efforts was a decade of patent litigation.\\nHere, as so often, the best defense is a good offense. If you can develop technology that's \\nsimply too hard for competitors to duplicate, you don't need to rely on other defenses. Start by \\npicking a hard problem, and then at every decision point, take the harder choice. [9]\\nThe Catch(es)\\nIf it were simply a matter of working harder than an ordinary employee and getting paid \\nproportionately, it would obviously be a good deal to start a startup.

Up to a point it would be \\nmore fun. I don't think many people like the slow pace of big companies, the interminable \\nmeetings, the water-cooler conversations, the clueless middle managers, and so on.\\nUnfortunately there are a couple catches. One is that you can't choose the point on the curve \\nthat you want to inhabit. You can't decide, for example, that you'd like to work just two or three \\ntimes as hard, and get paid that much more. When you're running a startup, your competitors \\ndecide how hard you work. And they pretty much all make the same decision: as hard as you \\npossibly can.\\nThe other catch is that the payoff is only on average proportionate to your productivity. There is, \\nas I said before, a large random multiplier in the success of any company. So in practice the \\ndeal is not that you're 30 times as productive and get paid 30 times as much. It is th\", \"tivity. There is, \\nas I said before, a large random multiplier in the success of any company.

Most startups tank, and not just the dogfood portals we all \\nheard about during the Internet Bubble. It's common for a startup to be developing a genuinely \\ngood product, take slightly too long to do it, run out of money, and have to shut down.\\nA startup is like a mosquito. A bear can absorb a hit and a crab is armored against one, but a \\nmosquito is designed for one thing: to score. No energy is wasted on defense. The defense of \\nmosquitos, as a species, is that there are a lot of them, but this is little consolation to the \\nindividual mosquito.\\nStartups, like mosquitos, tend to be an all-or-nothing proposition.

Fortunately we got bought at the top of the cycle, but \\nit was damned close. While we were visiting Yahoo in California to talk about selling the \\ncompany to them, we had to borrow a conference room to reassure an investor who was about \\nto back out of a new round of funding that we needed to stay alive.\\nThe all-or-nothing aspect of startups was not something we wanted. Viaweb's hackers were all \\nextremely risk-averse. If there had been some way just to work super hard and get paid for it, \\nwithout having a lottery mixed in, we would have been delighted.

Unfortunately, there is not currently any space \\nin the business world where you can get the first deal.\\nThe closest you can get is by selling your startup in the early stages, giving up upside (and risk) \\nfor a smaller but guaranteed payoff. We had a chance to do this, and stupidly, as we then \\nthought, let it slip by. After that we became comically eager to sell. For the next year or so, if \\nanyone expressed the slightest curiosity about Viaweb we would try to sell them the company. \\nBut there were no takers, so we had to keep going.\\nIt would have been a bargain to buy us at an early stage, but companies doing acquisitions are \\nnot looking for bargains.

So it is easier to sell an established \\nstartup, even at a large premium, than an early-stage one.\\nGet Users\\nI think it's a good idea to get bought, if you can. Running a business is different from growing \\none. It is just as well to let a big company take over once you reach cruising altitude. It's also \\nfinancially wiser, because selling allows you to diversify.

For most of human history it has not even been \\nthe most common. Until a few centuries ago, the main sources of wealth were mines, slaves \\nand serfs, land, and cattle, and the only ways to acquire these rapidly were by inheritance, \\nmarriage, conquest, or confiscation. Naturally wealth had a bad reputation.\\nTwo things changed. The first was the rule of law.

The first was the rule of law. For most of the world's history, if you did \\nsomehow accumulate a fortune, the ruler or his henchmen would find a way to steal it. But in \\nmedieval Europe something new happened. A new class of merchants and manufacturers \\nbegan to collect in towns. [10] Together they were able to withstand the local feudal lord. So for \\nthe first time in our history, the bullies stopped stealing the nerds' lunch money. This was \\nnaturally a great incentive, and possibly indeed the main cause of the second big change, \\nindustrialization.\\nA great deal has been written about the causes of the Industrial Revolution. But surely a \\nnecessary, if not sufficient, condition was that people who made fortunes be able to enjoy them \\nin peace. [11] One piece of evidence is what happened to countries that tried to return to the \\nold model, like the Soviet Union, \", \"t, condition was that people who made fortunes be able to enjoy them \\nin peace. [11] One piece of evidence is what happened to countries that tried to return to the \\nold model, like the Soviet Union, and to a lesser extent Britain under the labor governments of \\nthe 1960s and early 1970s. Take away the incentive of wealth, and technical innovation grinds \\nto a halt.\\nRemember what a startup is, economically: a way of saying, I want to work faster. Instead of \\naccumulating money slowly by being paid a regular wage for fifty years, I want to get it over with \\nas soon as possible. So governments that forbid you to accumulate wealth are in effect \\ndecreeing that you work slowly. They're willing to let you earn $3 million over fifty years, but \\nthey're not willing to let you work so hard that you can do it in two. They are like the corporate \\nboss that you can't go to and say, I want to work ten times as hard, so please pay me ten times \\na much.

They are like the corporate \\nboss that you can't go to and say, I want to work ten times as hard, so please pay me ten times \\na much. Except this is not a boss you can escape by starting your own company.\\nThe problem with working slowly is not just that technical innovation happens slowly. It's that it \\ntends not to happen at all. It's only when you're deliberately looking for hard problems, as a way \\nto use speed to the greatest advantage, that you take on this kind of project. Developing new \\ntechnology is a pain in the ass. It is, as Edison said, one percent inspiration and ninety-nine \\npercent perspiration. Without the incentive of wealth, no one wants to do it. Engineers will work \\non sexy projects like fighter planes and moon rockets for ordinary salaries, but more mundane \\ntechnologies like light bulbs or semiconductors have to be developed by entrepreneurs.\\nStartups are not just something that happened in Silicon Valley in the last couple decades. \\nSince it \", \"e mundane \\ntechnologies like light bulbs or semiconductors have to be developed by entrepreneurs.\\nStartups are not just something that happened in Silicon Valley in the last couple decades. \\nSince it became possible to get rich by creating wealth, everyone who has done it has used \\nessentially the same recipe: measurement and leverage, where measurement comes from \\nworking with a small group, and leverage from developing new techniques. The recipe was the \\nsame in Florence in 1200 as it is in Santa Clara today.\\nUnderstanding this may help to answer an important question: why Europe grew so powerful. \\nWas it something about the geography of Europe? Was it that Europeans are somehow racially \\nsuperior? Was it their religion? The answer (or at least the proximate cause) may be that the \\nEuropeans rode on the crest of a powerful new idea: allowing those who made a lot of money to \\nkeep it.\\nOnce you're allowed to do that, people who want to get rich can do it by generating wealth \\ninstead o\", \"eans rode on the crest of a powerful new idea: allowing those who made a lot of money to \\nkeep it.\\nOnce you're allowed to do that, people who want to get rich can do it by generating wealth \\ninstead of stealing it. The resulting technological growth translates not only into wealth but into \\nmilitary power. The theory that led to the stealth plane was developed by a Soviet \\nmathematician. But because the Soviet Union didn't have a computer industry, it remained for \\nthem a theory; they didn't have hardware capable of executing the calculations fast enough to \\ndesign an actual airplane.\\nIn that respect the Cold War teaches the same lesson as World War II and, for that matter, most \\nwars in recent history. Don't let a ruling class of warriors and politicians squash the \\nentrepreneurs. The same recipe that makes individuals rich makes countries powerful.

Different kinds of work have different time \\nquanta. Someone proofreading a manuscript could probably be interrupted every fifteen minutes with little loss of \\nproductivity. But the time quantum for hacking is very long: it might take an hour just to load a problem into your head. \\nSo the cost of having someone from personnel call you about a form you forgot to fill out can be huge.\\nThis is why hackers give you such a baleful stare as they turn from their screen to answer your question.

Among \\nprogrammers it means a good programmer. But the two meanings are connected. To \\nprogrammers, \"hacker\" connotes mastery in the most literal sense: someone who can make a \\ncomputer do what he wants—whether the computer wants to or not.\\nTo add to the confusion, the noun \"hack\" also has two senses. It can be either a compliment or \\nan insult. It\\'s called a hack when you do something in an ugly way. But when you do something \\nso clever that you somehow beat the system, that\\'s also called a ha', 'es. It can be either a compliment or \\nan insult. It\\'s called a hack when you do something in an ugly way. But when you do something \\nso clever that you somehow beat the system, that\\'s also called a hack. The word is used more \\noften in the former than the latter sense, probably because ugly solutions are more common \\nthan brilliant ones.\\nBelieve it or not, the two senses of \"hack\" are also connected. Ugly and imaginative solutions \\nhave something in common: they both break the rules. And there is a gradual continuum \\nbetween rule breaking that\\'s merely ugly (using duct tape to attach something to your bike) and \\nrule breaking that is brilliantly imaginative (discarding Euclidean space).\\nHacking predates computers.

Another \\nfriend of mine once got in trouble with the government for breaking into computers. This had \\nonly recently been declared a crime, and the FBI found that their usual investigative technique \\ndidn't work. Police investigation apparently begins with a motive. The usual motives are few: \\ndrugs, money, sex, revenge.

Odds are it isn't. \\nOdds are you just think what you're told.\\nThe other alternative would be that you independently considered every question and came up \\nwith the exact same answers that are now considered acceptable. That seems unlikely, \\nbecause you'd also have to make the same mistakes. Mapmakers deliberately put slight \\nmistakes in their maps so they can tell when someone copies them. If another map has the \\nsame mistake, that's very convincing evidence.\\nLike every oth\", 'ame mistakes. Mapmakers deliberately put slight \\nmistakes in their maps so they can tell when someone copies them. If another map has the \\nsame mistake, that\\'s very convincing evidence.\\nLike every other era in history, our moral map almost certainly contains a few mistakes. And \\nanyone who makes the same mistakes probably didn\\'t do it by accident. It would be like \\nsomeone claiming they had independently decided in 1972 that bell-bottom jeans were a good \\nidea.\\nIf you believe everything you\\'re supposed to now, how can you be sure you wouldn\\'t also have \\nbelieved everything you were supposed to if you had grown up among the plantation owners of \\nthe pre-Civil War South, or in Germany in the 1930s ÿý or among the Mongols in 1200, for that \\nmatter? Odds are you would have.\\nBack in the era of terms like \"well-adjusted,\" the idea seemed to be that there was something \\nwrong with you if you thought things you didn\\'t dare say out loud. This seems backward. Almost \\ncertainly, there is somethin', 'terms like \"well-adjusted,\" the idea seemed to be that there was something \\nwrong with you if you thought things you didn\\'t dare say out loud. This seems backward. Almost \\ncertainly, there is something wrong with you if you don\\'t think things you don\\'t dare say out loud.\\nTrouble\\nWhat can\\'t we say? One way to find these ideas is simply to look at things people do say, and \\nget in trouble for. [2]\\nOf course, we\\'re not just looking for things we can\\'t say. We\\'re looking for things we can\\'t say \\nthat are true, or at least have enough chance of being true that the question should remain \\nopen. But many of the things people get in trouble for saying probably do make it over this \\nsecond, lower threshold. No one gets in trouble for saying that 2 + 2 is 5, or that people in \\nPittsburgh are ten feet tall. Such obviously false statements might be treated as jokes, or at \\nworst as evidence of insanity, but they are not likely to make anyone mad. The statements that \\nmake people mad are the ones t', \"t tall. Such obviously false statements might be treated as jokes, or at \\nworst as evidence of insanity, but they are not likely to make anyone mad. The statements that \\nmake people mad are the ones they worry might be believed. I suspect the statements that \\nmake people maddest are those they worry might be true.\\nIf Galileo had said that people in Padua were ten feet tall, he would have been regarded as a \\nharmless eccentric. Saying the earth orbited the sun was another matter. The church knew this \\nwould set people thinking.\\nCertainly, as we look back on the past, this rule of thumb works well. A lot of the statements \\npeople got in trouble for seem harmless now. So it's likely that visitors from the future would \\nagree with at least some of the statements that get people in trouble today. Do we have no \\nGalileos? Not likely.\\nTo find them, keep track of opinions that get people in trouble, and start asking, could this be \\ntrue? Ok, it may be heretical (or whatever modern equivalent),\", 'y. Do we have no \\nGalileos? Not likely.\\nTo find them, keep track of opinions that get people in trouble, and start asking, could this be \\ntrue? Ok, it may be heretical (or whatever modern equivalent), but might it also be true?\\nHeresy\\nThis won\\'t get us all the answers, though. What if no one happens to have gotten in trouble for a \\nparticular idea yet? What if some idea would be so radioactively controversial that no one would \\ndare express it in public? How can we find these too?\\nAnother approach is to follow that word, heresy. In every period of history, there seem to have \\nbeen labels that got applied to statements to shoot them down before anyone had a chance to \\nask if they were true or not. \"Blasphemy\", \"sacrilege\", and \"heresy\" were such labels for a good \\npart of western history, as in more recent times \"indecent\", \"improper\", and \"unamerican\" have \\nbeen. By now these labels have lost their sting. They always do. By now they\\'re mostly used \\nironically. But in their time, they h', 's in more recent times \"indecent\", \"improper\", and \"unamerican\" have \\nbeen. By now these labels have lost their sting. They always do. By now they\\'re mostly used \\nironically. But in their time, they had real force.\\nThe word \"defeatist\", for example, has no particular political connotations now. But in Germany \\nin 1917 it was a weapon, used by Ludendorff in a purge of those who favored a negotiated \\npeace. At the start of World War II it was used extensively by Churchill and his supporters to \\nsilence their opponents. In 1940, any argument against Churchill\\'s aggressive policy was \\n\"defeatist\". Was it right or wrong? Ideally, no one got far enough to ask that.\\nWe have such labels today, of course, quite a lot of them, from the all-purpose \"inappropriate\" \\nto the dreaded \"divisive.\" In any period, it should be easy to figure out what such labels are, \\nsimply by looking at what people call ideas they disagree with besides untrue. When a politician \\nsays his opponent is mistaken, that\\'s a ', 'eriod, it should be easy to figure out what such labels are, \\nsimply by looking at what people call ideas they disagree with besides untrue. When a politician \\nsays his opponent is mistaken, that\\'s a straightforward criticism, but when he attacks a \\nstatement as \"divisive\" or \"racially insensitive\" instead of arguing that it\\'s false, we should start \\npaying attention.\\nSo another way to figure out which of our taboos future generations will laugh at is to start with \\nthe labels. Take a label ÿý \"sexist\", for example ÿý and try to think of some ideas that would be \\ncalled that. Then for each ask, might this be true?\\nJust start listing ideas at random? Yes, because they won\\'t really be random. The ideas that \\ncome to mind first will be the most plausible ones. They\\'ll be things you\\'ve already noticed but \\ndidn\\'t let yourself think.\\nIn 1989 some clever researchers tracked the eye movements of radiologists as they scanned \\nchest images for signs of lung cancer. [3] They found that even when', \" noticed but \\ndidn't let yourself think.\\nIn 1989 some clever researchers tracked the eye movements of radiologists as they scanned \\nchest images for signs of lung cancer. [3] They found that even when the radiologists missed a \\ncancerous lesion, their eyes had usually paused at the site of it. Part of their brain knew there \\nwas something there; it just didn't percolate all the way up into conscious knowledge. I think \\nmany interesting heretical thoughts are already mostly formed in our minds. If we turn off our \\nself-censorship temporarily, those will be the first to emerge.\\nTime and Space\\nIf we could look into the future it would be obvious which of our taboos they'd laugh at. We can't \\ndo that, but we can do something almost as good: we can look into the past. Another way to \\nfigure out what we're getting wrong is to look at what used to be acceptable and is now \\nunthinkable.\\nChanges between the past and the present sometimes do represent progress. In a field like \\nphysics, if we di\", \" what we're getting wrong is to look at what used to be acceptable and is now \\nunthinkable.\\nChanges between the past and the present sometimes do represent progress. In a field like \\nphysics, if we disagree with past generations it's because we're right and they're wrong. But this \\nbecomes rapidly less true as you move away from the certainty of the hard sciences. By the \\ntime you get to social questions, many changes are just fashion. The age of consent fluctuates \\nlike hemlines.\\nWe may imagine that we are a great deal smarter and more virtuous than past generations, but \\nthe more history you read, the less likely this seems. People in past times were much like us. \\nNot heroes, not barbarians. Whatever their ideas were, they were ideas reasonable people \\ncould believe.\\nSo here is another source of interesting heresies. Diff present ideas against those of various \\npast cultures, and see what you get. [4] Some will be shocking by present standards. Ok, fine; \\nbut which might also be tru\", 'source of interesting heresies. Diff present ideas against those of various \\npast cultures, and see what you get. [4] Some will be shocking by present standards. Ok, fine; \\nbut which might also be true?\\nYou don\\'t have to look into the past to find big differences. In our own time, different societies \\nhave wildly varying ideas of what\\'s ok and what isn\\'t. So you can try diffing other cultures\\' ideas \\nagainst ours as well. (The best way to do that is to visit them.) Any idea that\\'s considered \\nharmless in a significant percentage of times and places, and yet is taboo in ours, is a \\ncandidate for something we\\'re mistaken about.\\nFor example, at the high water mark of political correctness in the early 1990s, Harvard \\ndistributed to its faculty and staff a brochure saying, among other things, that it was \\ninappropriate to compliment a colleague or student\\'s clothes. No more \"nice shirt.\" I think this \\nprinciple is rare among the world\\'s cultures, past or present. There are probably more wh', 'that it was \\ninappropriate to compliment a colleague or student\\'s clothes. No more \"nice shirt.\" I think this \\nprinciple is rare among the world\\'s cultures, past or present. There are probably more where it\\'s \\nconsidered especially polite to compliment someone\\'s clothing than where it\\'s considered \\nimproper. Odds are this is, in a mild form, an example of one of the taboos a visitor from the \\nfuture would have to be careful to avoid if he happened to set his time machine for Cambridge, \\nMassachusetts, 1992. [5]\\nPrigs\\nOf course, if they have time machines in the future they\\'ll probably have a separate reference \\nmanual just for Cambridge. This has always been a fussy place, a town of i dotters and t \\ncrossers, where you\\'re liable to get both your grammar and your ideas corrected in the same \\nconversation. And that suggests another way to find taboos. Look for prigs, and see what\\'s \\ninside their heads.\\nKids\\' heads are repositories of all our taboos. It seems fitting to us that kids\\' idea', ' \\nconversation. And that suggests another way to find taboos. Look for prigs, and see what\\'s \\ninside their heads.\\nKids\\' heads are repositories of all our taboos. It seems fitting to us that kids\\' ideas should be \\nbright and clean. The picture we give them of the world is not merely simplified, to suit their \\ndeveloping minds, but sanitized as well, to suit our ideas of what kids ought to think. [6]\\nYou can see this on a small scale in the matter of dirty words. A lot of my friends are starting to \\nhave children now, and they\\'re all trying not to use words like \"fuck\" and \"shit\" within baby\\'s \\nhearing, lest baby start using these words too. But these words are part of the language, and \\nadults use them all the time. So parents are giving their kids an inaccurate idea of the language \\nby not using them. Why do they do this? Because they don\\'t think it\\'s fitting that kids should use \\nthe whole language. We like children to seem innocent. [7]\\nMost adults, likewise, deliberately give kids a', \" using them. Why do they do this? Because they don't think it's fitting that kids should use \\nthe whole language. We like children to seem innocent. [7]\\nMost adults, likewise, deliberately give kids a misleading view of the world. One of the most \\nobvious examples is Santa Claus. We think it's cute for little kids to believe in Santa Claus. I \\nmyself think it's cute for little kids to believe in Santa Claus. But one wonders, do we tell them \\nthis stuff for their sake, or for ours?\\nI'm not arguing for or against this idea here. It is probably inevitable that parents should want to \\ndress up their kids' minds in cute little baby outfits. I'll probably do it myself. The important thing \\nfor our purposes is that, as a result, a well brought-up teenage kid's brain is a more or less \\ncomplete collection of all our taboos ÿý and in mint condition, because they're untainted by \\nexperience. Whatever we think that will later turn out to be ridiculous, it's almost certainly inside \\nthat head.\\nHow\", \"llection of all our taboos ÿý and in mint condition, because they're untainted by \\nexperience. Whatever we think that will later turn out to be ridiculous, it's almost certainly inside \\nthat head.\\nHow do we get at these ideas? By the following thought experiment.

The specifics don't matter ÿý just \\nsomeone who has seen a lot. Now imagine comparing what's inside this guy's head with what's \\ninside the head of a well-behaved sixteen year old girl from the suburbs. What does he think \\nthat would shock her? He knows the world; she knows, or at least embodies, present taboos. \\nSubtract one from the other, and the result is what we can't say. \\nMechanism\\nI can think of one more way to figure out what we can't say: to look at how taboos are created. \\nHow do moral fashions arise, and why are they adopted?

If we can understand this mechanism, \\nwe may be able to see it at work in our own time.\\nMoral fashions don't seem to be created the way ordinary fashions are. Ordinary fashions seem \\nto arise by accident when everyone imitates the whim of some influential person. The fashion \\nfor broad-toed shoes in late fifteenth century Europe began because Charles VIII of France had \\nsix toes on one foot. The fashion for the name Gary began when the actor Frank Cooper \\nadopted the name of a tough mill town in Indiana. Moral fashions more often seem to be \\ncreated deliberately. When there's something we can't say, it's often because some group \\ndoesn't want us to.\\nThe prohibition will be strongest when the group is nervous.

The irony of Galileo's situation was \\nthat he got in trouble for repeating Copernicus's ideas. Copernicus himself didn't. In fact, \\nCopernicus was a canon of a cathedral, and dedicated his book to the pope. But by Galileo's \\ntime the church was in the throes of the Counter-Reformation and was much more worried \\nabout unorthodox ideas.\\nTo launch a taboo, a group has to be poised halfway between weakness and power. A confident \\ngroup doesn't need taboos to protect it. It's not considered improper to make disparaging \\nremarks about Americans, or the English. And yet a group has to be powerful enough to \\nenforce a taboo. Coprophiles, as of this writing, don't seem to be numerous or energetic enough \\nto have had their interests promoted to a lifestyle.\\nI suspect the biggest source of moral taboos will turn out to be power struggles in which one \\nside only barely has the upper hand.\", \"ergetic enough \\nto have had their interests promoted to a lifestyle.\\nI suspect the biggest source of moral taboos will turn out to be power struggles in which one \\nside only barely has the upper hand. That's where you'll find a group powerful enough to \\nenforce taboos, but weak enough to need them.\\nMost struggles, whatever they're really about, will be cast as struggles between competing \\nideas. The English Reformation was at bottom a struggle for wealth and power, but it ended up \\nbeing cast as a struggle to preserve the souls of Englishmen from the corrupting influence of \\nRome. It's easier to get people to fight for an idea. And whichever side wins, their ideas will also \\nbe considered to have triumphed, as if God wanted to signal his agreement by selecting that \\nside as the victor.\\nWe often like to think of World War II as a triumph of freedom over totalitarianism. We \\nconveniently forget that the Soviet Union was also one of the winners.\\nI'm not saying that struggles are never abo\", \"often like to think of World War II as a triumph of freedom over totalitarianism. We \\nconveniently forget that the Soviet Union was also one of the winners.\\nI'm not saying that struggles are never about ideas, just that they will always be made to seem \\nto be about ideas, whether they are or not. And just as there is nothing so unfashionable as the \\nlast, discarded fashion, there is nothing so wrong as the principles of the most recently \\ndefeated opponent. Representational art is only now recovering from the approval of both Hitler \\nand Stalin. [8]\\nAlthough moral fashions tend to arise from different sources than fashions in clothing, the \\nmechanism of their adoption seems much the same. The early adopters will be driven by \\nambition: self-consciously cool people who want to distinguish themselves from the common \\nherd. As the fashion becomes established they'll be joined by a second, much larger group, \\ndriven by fear.

What groups are powerful but nervous, and what ideas would \\nthey like to suppress? What ideas were tarnished by association when they ended up on the \\nlosing side of a recent struggle? If a self-consciously cool person wanted to differentiate himself \\nfrom preceding fashions (e.g. from his parents), which of their ideas would he tend to reject? \\nWhat are conventional-minded people afraid of saying?\\nThis technique won't find us all the things we can't say. I can think of some that aren't the result \\nof any recent struggle. Many of our taboos are rooted deep in the past. But this approach, \\ncombined with the\", \"que won't find us all the things we can't say. I can think of some that aren't the result \\nof any recent struggle.

And I'm \\nespecially curious about anything that's forbidden. Let me see and decide for myself.\\nSecond, I do it because I don't like the idea of being mistaken. If, like other eras, we believe \\nthings that will later seem ridiculous, I want to know what they are so that I, at least, can avoid \\nbelieving them.\\nThird, I do it because it's good for the brain.

Natural selection, for example. It's so simple. Why didn't \\nanyone think of it before? Well, that is all too obvious. Darwin himself was careful to tiptoe \\naround the implications of his theory. He wanted to spend his time thinking about biology, not \\narguing with people who accused him of being an atheist.\\nIn the sciences, especially, it's a great advantage to be able to question assumptions. The m.o. \\nof scientists, or at least of the good ones, is precisely that: look for places where conventional \\nwisdom is broken, and then try to pry apart the cracks and see what's underneath.

This should be the m.o. of any scholar, \\nbut scientists seem much more willing to look under rocks. [10]\\nWhy? It could be that the scientists are simply smarter; most physicists could, if necessary, \\nmake it through a PhD program in French literature, but few professors of French literature \\ncould make it through a PhD program in physics. Or it could be because it's clearer in the \\nsciences whether theories are true or false, and this makes scientists bolder.

You can \\nsee that in the way they dress.\\nIt's not only in the sciences that heresy pays off. In any competitive field, you can win big by \\nseeing things that others daren't. And in every field there are probably heresies few dare utter. \\nWithin the US car industry there is a lot of hand-wringing now about declining market share.

If you argue against \\ncensorship in general, you can avoid being accused of whatever heresy is contained in the \\nbook or film that someone is trying to censor. You can attack labels with meta-labels: labels that \\nrefer to the use of labels to prevent discussion. The spread of the term \"political correctness\" \\nmeant the beginning of the end of political correctness, because it enabled one to attack the \\nphenomenon as a whole without being accused of any of the specific heresies it sought to \\nsuppress.\\nAnother way to counterattack is with metaphor.

Descartes, though claimed by the French, did much of his thinking in Holland.\\nAnd yet, I wonder. The Dutch seem to live their lives up to their necks in rules and regulations. \\nThere\\'s so much you can\\'t do there; is there really nothing you can\\'t say?\\nCertainly the fact that they value open-mindedness is no guarantee.

(Some tribes may avoid \"wrong\" as \\njudgemental, and may instead use a more neutral sounding euphemism like \"negative\" or \\n\"destructive\".)\\nWhen people are bad at math, they know it, because they get the wrong answers on tests. But \\nwhen people are bad at open-mindedness they don\\'t know it. In fact they tend to think the \\nopposite. Remember, it\\'s the nature of fashion to be invisible. It wouldn\\'t work otherwise. \\nFashion doesn\\'t seem like fashion to someone in the grip of it. It just seems like the right thing \\nto do.

So when you see statements being attacked as x-ist or y-ic (substitute your \\ncurrent values of x and y), whether in 1630 or 2030, that\\'s a sure sign that something is wrong. \\nWhen you hear such labels being used, ask why.\\nEspecially if you hear yourself using them.

A lot of \\npeople seemed surprised that someone interested in computers would also be interested in \\npainting. They seemed to think that hacking and painting were very different kinds of work-- that \\nhacking was cold, precise, and methodical, and that painting was the frenzied expression of \\nsome primal urge.\\nBoth of these images are wrong.', 'ng and painting were very different kinds of work-- that \\nhacking was cold, precise, and methodical, and that painting was the frenzied expression of \\nsome primal urge.\\nBoth of these images are wrong. Hacking and painting have a lot in common. In fact, of all the \\ndifferent types of people I\\'ve known, hackers and painters are among the most alike.\\nWhat hackers and painters have in common is that they\\'re both makers. Along with composers, \\narchitects, and writers, what hackers and painters are trying to do is make good things. They\\'re \\nnot doing research per se, though if in the course of trying to make good things they discover \\nsome new technique, so much the better.\\nI\\'ve never liked the term \"computer science.\" The main reason I don\\'t like it is that there\\'s no \\nsuch thing. Computer science is a grab bag of tenuously related areas thrown together by an \\naccident of history, like Yugoslavia.

In the middle you \\nhave people working on something like the natural history of computers-- studying the behavior \\nof algorithms for routing data through networks, for example. And then at the other extreme you \\nhave the hackers, who are trying to write interesting software, and for whom computers are just \\na medium of expression, as concrete is for architects or paint for painters. It\\'s as if \\nmathematicians, physicists, and architects all had to be in the same department.\\nSometimes what the hackers do is called \"software engineering,\" but this term is just as \\nmisleading. Good software designers are no more engineers than architects are. The border \\nbetween architecture and engineering is not sharply defined, but it\\'s there.

You\\'re asking for trouble if you try to decide \\nwhat to do without understanding how to do it. But hacking can certainly be more than just \\ndeciding how to implement some spec. At its best, it\\'s creating the spec-- though it turns out the \\nbest way to do that is to implement it.\\nPerhaps one day \"computer science\" will, like Yugoslavia, get broken up into its component \\nparts. That might be a good thing. Especially if it meant independence for my native land, \\nhacking.\\nBundling all these different types of work together in one department may be convenient \\nadministratively, but it\\'s confusing intellectually.

But the people at either end, the hackers and the mathematicians, are \\nnot actually doing science.\\nThe mathematicians don\\'t seem bothered by this. They happily set to work proving theorems \\nlike the other mathematicians over in the math department, and probably soon stop noticing \\nthat the building they work in says ``computer science\\'\\' on the outside. But for the hackers this \\nlabel is a problem. If what they\\'re doing is called science, it makes them feel they ought to be \\nacting scientific. So instead of doing what they really want to do, which is to design beautiful \\nsoftware, hackers in universities and research labs feel they ought to be writing research papers.\\nIn the best case, the papers are ', \"of doing what they really want to do, which is to design beautiful \\nsoftware, hackers in universities and research labs feel they ought to be writing research papers.\\nIn the best case, the papers are just a formality.

It's easy to drift away from building beautiful \\nthings toward building ugly things that make more suitable subjects for research papers.\\nUnfortunately, beautiful things don't always make the best subjects for papers. Number one, \\nresearch must be original-- and as anyone who has written a PhD dissertation knows, the way \\nto be sure that you're exploring virgin territory is to to stake out a piece of ground that no one \\nwants.

Most of AI is an \\nexample of this rule; if you assume that knowledge can be represented as a list of predicate \\nlogic expressions whose arguments represent abstract concepts, you\\'ll have a lot of papers to \\nwrite about how to make this work. As Ricky Ricardo used to say, \"Lucy, you got a lot of \\nexplaining to do.\"\\nThe way to create something beautiful is often to make subtle tweaks to something that already \\nexists, or to combine existing ideas in a slightly new way. This kind of work is hard to convey in \\na research paper.\\nSo why do universities and research labs continue to judge hackers by publications?

For the \\nsame reason that \"scholastic aptitude\" gets measured by simple-minded standardized tests, or \\nthe productivity of programmers gets measured in lines of code. These tests are easy to apply, \\nand there is nothing so tempting as an easy test that kind of works.\\nMeasuring what hackers are actually trying to do, designing beautiful software, would be much \\nmore difficult. You need a good sense of design to judge good design. And there is no \\ncorrelation, except possibly a negative one, between people\\'s ability to recognize good design \\nand their confidence that they can.\\nThe only external test is time. Over time, beautiful things tend to thrive, and ugly things tend to \\nget discarded.

In this they are no different from other makers. In fact, they're lucky by comparison. \\nThe influence of fashion is not nearly so great in hacking as it is in painting.\\nThere are worse things than having people misunderstand your work. A worse danger is that \\nyou will yourself misunderstand your work. Related fields are where you go looking for ideas.

Hackers need to understand the theory of computation about as \\nmuch as painters need to understand paint chemistry. You need to know how to calculate time \\nand space complexity and about Turing completeness. You might also want to remember at \\nleast the concept of a state machine, in case you have to write a parser or a regular expression \\nlibrary. Painters in fact have to remember a good deal more about paint chemistry than that.\\nI\\'ve found that the best sources of ideas are not the other fields that have the word \"computer\" \\nin their names, but the other fields inhabited by makers.

I found that I did not program this way. I found that I liked to \\nprogram sitting in front of a computer, not a piece of paper. Worse still, instead of patiently \\nwriting out a complete program and assuring myself it was correct, I tended to just spew out \\ncode that was hopelessly broken, and gradually beat it into shape. Debugging, I was taught, \\nwas a kind of final pass where you caught typos and oversights. The way I worked, it seemed \\nlike programming consisted of debugging.\\nFor a long time I felt bad about this, just as I once felt bad that I didn\\'t hold my pencil the way \\nthey taught me to i', \"ersights.

If I had only looked over at the other makers, the \\npainters or the architects, I would have realized that there was a name for what I was doing: \\nsketching. As far as I can tell, the way they taught me to program in college was all wrong. You \\nshould figure out programs as you're writing them, just as writers and painters and architects do.\\nRealizing this has real implications for software design. It means that a programming language \\nshould, above all, be malleable. A programming language is for thinking of programs, not for \\nexpressing programs you've already thought of. It should be a pencil, not a pen.

Everyone in the sciences secretly believes that \\nmathematicians are smarter than they are. I think mathematicians also believe this. At any rate, \\nthe result is that scientists tend to make their work look as mathematical as possible.

And so there is a great temptation to work on problems you can treat formally, rather \\nthan problems that are, say, important.\\nIf hackers identified with other makers, like writers and painters, they wouldn't feel tempted to \\ndo this. Writers and painters don't suffer from math envy. They feel as if they're doing something \\ncompletely unrelated. So are hackers, I think.\\nIf universities and research labs keep hackers from doing the kind of work they want to do, \\nperhaps the place for them is in companies.

Programmers were seen as technicians who translated the visions (if that is the \\nword) of product managers into code.\\nThis seems to be the default plan in big companies. They do it because it decreases the \\nstandard deviation of the outcome. Only a small percentage of hackers can actually design \\nsoftware, and it's hard for the people running a company to pick these out.

Big companies want to decrease the standard deviation of design outcomes \\nbecause they want to avoid disasters. But when you damp oscillations, you lose the high points \\nas well as the low. This is not a problem for big companies, because they don't win by making \\ngreat products. Big companies win by sucking less than other big companies.\\nSo if you can figure out a way to get in a design war with a company big enough that its \\nsoftware is designed by product managers, they'll never be able to keep up with you.

That's where you can win big by taking the bold approach to design, and \\nhaving the same people both design and implement the product. Microsoft themselves did this \\nat the start. So did Apple. And Hewlett-Packard. I suspect almost every successful startup has.\\nSo one way to build great software is to start your own startup. There are two problems with \\nthis, though.

A hacker working on some programming language or operating system \\nmight likewise be able to get a day job using it. [1]\\nWhen I say that the answer is for hackers to have day jobs, and work on beautiful software on \\nthe side, I'm not proposing this as a new idea. This is what open-source hacking is all about. \\nWhat I'm saying is that open-source is probably the right model, because it has been \\nindependently confirmed by all the other makers.\\nIt seems surprising to me that any employer would be reluctant to let hackers work on open-\\nsource projects.

When there's something in a painting that works very \\nwell, you can usually find version 1 of it in a smaller form in some earlier painting.\\nI think most makers work this way. Writers and architects seem to as well. Maybe it would be \\ngood for hackers to act more like painters, and regularly start over from scratch, instead of \\ncontinuing to work for years on one project, and trying to incorporate all their later ideas as \\nrevisions.\\nThe fact that hackers learn to hack by \", \", and regularly start over from scratch, instead of \\ncontinuing to work for years on one project, and trying to incorporate all their later ideas as \\nrevisions.\\nThe fact that hackers learn to hack by doing it is another sign of how different hacking is from \\nthe sciences. Scientists don't learn science by doing it, but by doing labs and problem sets. \\nScientists start out doing work that's perfect, in the sense that they're just trying to reproduce \\nwork someone else has already done for them. Eventually, they get to the point where they can \\ndo original work. Whereas hackers, from the start, are doing original work; it's just very bad. So \\nhackers start original, and get good, and scientists start good, and get original.\\nThe other way makers learn is from examples. For a painter, a museum is a reference library of \\ntechniques.

Benjamin Franklin learned to write by summarizing the points in the essays \\nof Addison and Steele and then trying to reproduce them. Raymond Chandler did the same \\nthing with detective stories.\\nHackers, likewise, can learn to program by looking at good programs-- not just at what they do, \\nbut the source code too. One of the less publicized benefits of the open-source movement is \\nthat it has made it easier to learn to program. When I learned to program, we had to rely mostly \\non examples in books. The one big chunk of code available then was Unix, but even this was \\nnot open source. Most of the people who read the source read it in illicit photocopies of John \\nLions' book, which though written in 1977 was not allowed to be published\", \"n was Unix, but even this was \\nnot open source. Most of the people who read the source read it in illicit photocopies of John \\nLions' book, which though written in 1977 was not allowed to be published until 1996.\\nAnother example we can take from painting is the way that paintings are created by gradual \\nrefinement. Paintings usually begin with a sketch. Gradually the details get filled in. But it is not \\nmerely a process of filling in. Sometimes the original plans turn out to be mistaken. Countless \\npaintings, when you look at them in xrays, turn out to have limbs that have been moved or facial \\nfeatures that have been readjusted.\\nHere's a case where we can learn from painting. I think hacking should work this way too. It's \\nunrealistic to expect that the specifications for a program will be perfect. You're better off if you \\nadmit this up front, and write programs in a way that allows specifications to change on the fly.\\n(The structure of large companies makes this hard for them to do\", \"be perfect. You're better off if you \\nadmit this up front, and write programs in a way that allows specifications to change on the fly.\\n(The structure of large companies makes this hard for them to do, so here is another place \\nwhere startups have an advantage.)\\nEveryone by now presumably knows about the danger of premature optimization. I think we \\nshould be just as worried about premature design-- deciding too early what a program should \\ndo.\\nThe right tools can help us avoid this danger. A good programming language should, like oil \\npaint, make it easy to change your mind. Dynamic typing is a win here because you don't have \\nto commit to specific data representations up front. But the key to flexibility, I think, is to make \\nthe language very abstract. The easiest program to change is one that's very short.\\nThis sounds like a paradox, but a great painting has to be better than it has to be. For example, \\nwhen Leonardo painted the portrait of Ginevra de Benci in the National Gallery,\", \"ne that's very short.\\nThis sounds like a paradox, but a great painting has to be better than it has to be. For example, \\nwhen Leonardo painted the portrait of Ginevra de Benci in the National Gallery, he put a juniper \\nbush behind her head. In it he carefully painted each individual leaf. Many painters might have \\nthought, this is just something to put in the background to frame her head. No one will look that \\nclosely at it.\\nNot Leonardo. How hard he worked on part of a painting didn't depend at all on how closely he \\nexpected anyone to look at it. He was like Michael Jordan. Relentless.\\nRelentlessness wins because, in the aggregate, unseen details become visible. When people \\nwalk by the portrait of Ginevra de Benci, their attention is often immediately arrested by it, even \\nbefore they look at the label and notice that it says Leonardo da Vinci. All those unseen details \\ncombine to produce something that's just stunning, like a thousand barely audible voices all \\nsinging in tune.\\nGr\", \"look at the label and notice that it says Leonardo da Vinci.

If you look inside good \\nsoftware, you find that parts no one is ever supposed to see are beautiful too. I'm not claiming I \\nwrite great software, but I know that when it comes to code I behave in a way that would make \\nme eligible for prescription drugs if I approached everyday life the same way. It drives me crazy \\nto see code that's badly indented, or that uses ugly variable names.\\nIf a hacker were a mere implementor, turning a spec into code, then he could just work his way \\nthrough it from one end to the other like someone digging a ditch. But if the hacker is a creator, \\nwe have to take inspiration into account.\\nIn hacking, like painting, work comes in cycles.

Sometimes you get excited about some new \\nproject and you want to work sixteen hours a day on it. Other times nothing seems interesting.\\nTo do good work you have to take these cycles into account, because they're affected by how \\nyou react to them. When you're driving a car with a manual transmission on a hill, you have to \\nback off the clutch sometimes to avoid stalling. Backing off can likewise prevent ambition from \\nstalling. In both painting and hacking there are some tasks that are terrifyingly ambitious, and \\nothers that are comfortingly routine. It's a good idea to save some easy tasks for moments \\nwhen you would otherwise stall.\\nIn hacking, this can literally mean saving up bugs. I like debugging: it's the one time that hacking \\nis as straightforward as people think it is.

Your program is supposed to do x. Instead it does y. Where does it go \\nwrong? You know you're going to win in the end. It's as relaxing as painting a wall.\\nThe example of painting can teach us not only how to manage our own work, but how to work \\ntogether. A lot of the great art of the past is the work of multiple hands, though there may only \\nbe one name on the wall next to it in the museum. Leonardo was an apprentice in the workshop \\nof Verrocchio and painted one of the angels in his Baptism of Christ. This sort of thing was the \\nrule, not the exception. Michelangelo was considered especially dedicated for insisting on \\npainting all the figures on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel himself.\\nAs far as I know, when painters worked together on a painting, they never worked on the sa\", \"especially dedicated for insisting on \\npainting all the figures on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel himself.\\nAs far as I know, when painters worked together on a painting, they never worked on the same \\nparts. It was common for the master to paint the principal figures and for assistants to paint the \\nothers and the background. But you never had one guy painting over the work of another.\\nI think this is the right model for collaboration in software too. Don't push it too far. When a piece \\nof code is being hacked by three or four different people, no one of whom really owns it, it will \\nend up being like a common-room. It will tend to feel bleak and abandoned, and accumulate \\ncruft. The right way to collaborate, I think, is to divide projects into sharply defined modules, \\neach with a definite owner, and with interfaces between them that are as carefully designed \\nand, if possible, as articulated as programming languages.\\nLike painting, most software is intended for a human audience. \", \"inite owner, and with interfaces between them that are as carefully designed \\nand, if possible, as articulated as programming languages.\\nLike painting, most software is intended for a human audience. And so hackers, like painters, \\nmust have empathy to do really great work. You have to be able to see things from the user's \\npoint of view.\\nWhen I was a kid I was always being told to look at things from someone else's point of view. \\nWhat this always meant in practice was to do what someone else wanted, instead of what I \\nwanted. This of course gave empathy a bad name, and I made a point of not cultivating it.\\nBoy, was I wrong. It turns out that looking at things from other people's point of view is \\npractically the secret of success. It doesn't necessarily mean being self-sacrificing. Far from it. \\nUnderstanding how someone else sees things doesn't imply that you'll act in his interest; in \\nsome situations-- in war, for example-- you want to do exactly the opposite.

[4]\\nMost makers make things for a human audience. And to engage an audience you have to \\nunderstand what they need. Nearly all the greatest paintings are paintings of people, for \\nexample, because people are what people are interested in.\\nEmpathy is probably the single most important difference between a good hacker and a great \\none. Some hackers are quite smart, but when it comes to empathy are practically solipsists. It's \\nhard for such people to design great software [5], because they can't see things from the user's \\npoint of view.\\nOne way to tell how good people are at empathy is to watch them explain a technical question \\nto someone without a technical background. We probably all know people who, though \\notherwise smart, are just comically bad at this. If someone asks them at a dinner party what a \\nprog\", \"nical question \\nto someone without a technical background.

If someone asks them at a dinner party what a \\nprogramming language is, they'll say something like ``Oh, a high-level language is what the \\ncompiler uses as input to generate object code.'' High-level language? Compiler? Object code? \\nSomeone who doesn't know what a programming language is obviously doesn't know what \\nthese things are, either.\\nPart of what software has to do is explain itself. So to write good software you have to \\nunderstand how little users understand. They're going to walk up to the software with no \\npreparation, and it had better do what they guess it will, because they're not going to read the \\nmanual. The best system I've ever seen in this respect was the original Macintosh, in 1985. It \\ndid what software almost never does: it just worked. [6]\\nSource code, too, should explain itself.

It's in your \\ninterest, because you'll be one of them. Many a hacker has written a program only to find on \\nreturning to it six months later that he has no idea how it works. I know several people who've \\nsworn off Perl after such experiences.

But there are plenty of dumb people \\nwho are bad at empathy too. Just listen to the people who call in with questions on talk shows. \\nThey ask whatever it is they're asking in such a roundabout way that the hosts often have to \\nrephrase the question for them.\\nSo, if hacking works like painting and writing, is it as cool? After all, you only get one life. You \\nmight as well spend it working on something great.\\nUnfortunately, the question is hard to answer. There is always a big time lag in prestige. It's like \\nlight from a distant star. Painting has prestige now because of great work people did five \\nhundred years ago.

We can see this happening already. Cobol, for all its sometime popularity, does not seem \\nto have any intellectual descendants. It is an evolutionary dead-end-- a Neanderthal language.\\nI predict a similar fate for Java.

It becomes a heuristic for \\nmaking the right decisions about language design.\\nAny programming language can be divided into two parts: some set of fundamental operators \\nthat play the role of axioms, and the rest of the language, which could in principle be written in \\nterms of these fundamental operators.\\nI think the fundamental operators are the most important factor in a language\\'s long term \\nsurvival.

My guess is that a hundred years \\nfrom now people will still tell computers what to do using programs we would recognize as \\nsuch.

In language design, we should be consciously seeking out \\nsituations where we can trade efficiency for even the smallest increase in convenience.\\nMost data structures exist because of speed. For example, many languages today have both \\nstrings and lists. Semantically, strings are more or less a subset of lists in which the elements \\nare characters. So why do you need a separate data type? You don't, really. Strings only exist \\nfor efficiency. But it's lame to clutter up the semantics of the language with hacks to make \\nprograms run faster.

Efficiency is important, \\nbut I don't think that's the right way to get it.\\nThe right way to solve that problem, I think, is to separate the meaning of a program from the \\nimplementation details. Instead of having both lists and strings, have just lists, with some way to \\ngive the compiler optimization advice that will allow it to lay out strings as contiguous bytes if \\nnecessary.\\nSince speed doesn't matter in most of a program, you won't ordinarily need to bother with this \\nsort of micromanagement.

I think some of the best programs were essays, in the sense that the authors didn\\'t know \\nwhen they started exactly what they were trying to write.\\nLisp hackers already know about the value of being flexible with data structures.

After all, they're \\njust a subset of hash tables where the keys are vectors of integers. Will we replace hash tables \\nthemselves with lists?\\nThere are more shocking prospects even than that. The Lisp that McCarthy described in 1960, \\nfor example, didn't have numbers. Logically, you don't need to have a separate notion of \\nnumbers, because you can represent them as lists: the integer n could be represented as a list \\nof n elements. You can do math this way.

When someone did, \\nunexpectedly, take this paper and translate it into a working Lisp interpreter, numbers certainly \\nweren't represented as lists; they were represented in binary, as in every other language.\\nCould a programming language go so far as to get rid of numbers as a fundamental data type? \\nI ask this not so much as a serious question as as a way to play chicken with the future.

If the \\nidea still seems unbearable in a hundred years, maybe it won't in a thousand.\\nJust to be clear about this, I'm not proposing that all numerical calculations would actually be \\ncarried out using lists. I'm proposing that the core language, prior to any additional notations \\nabout implementation, be defined this way.

This too is a trend we see happening already: many recent languages are \\ncompiled into byte code. Bill Woods once told me that, as a rule of thumb, each layer of \\ninterpretation costs a factor of 10 in speed. This extra cost buys you flexibility.\\nThe very first version of Arc was an extreme case of this sort of multi-level slowness, with \\ncorresponding benefits. It was a classic \"metacircular\" interpreter written on top of Common \\nLisp, with a definite family resemblance to the eval function defined in McCarthy\\'s original Lisp \\npaper. The whole thing was only a couple hundred lines of code, so it was very easy to \\nunderstand and change. The Common Lisp we used, CLisp, itself runs on top of a byte code \\ninterpreter.

Barely usable, I admit, but usable.\\nWriting software as multiple layers is a powerful technique even within applications. Bottom-up \\nprogramming means writing a program as a series of layers, each of which serves as a \\nlanguage for the one above. This approach tends to yield smaller, more flexible programs. It's \\nalso the best route to that holy grail, reusability. A language is by definition reusable. The more \\nof your application you can push down into a language for writing that type of application, the \\nmore of your software will be reusable.\\nSomehow the idea of reusability got attached to object-oriented programming in the 1980s, and \\nno amount of evidence to the contrary seems to be able to shake it free.

Consider libraries: they're reusable because they're language, whether they're \\nwritten in an object-oriented style or not.\\nI don't predict the demise of object-oriented programming, by the way. Though I don't think it \\nhas much to offer good programmers, except in certain specialized domains, it is irresistible to \\nlarge organizations. Object-oriented programming offers a sustainable way to write spaghetti \\ncode. It lets you accrete programs as a series of patches.

Already chip designers have to think about it, and so must people trying to \\nwrite systems software on multi-cpu computers.\\nThe real question is, how far up the ladder of abstraction will parallelism go?

This is \\na special case of my more general prediction that most of the extra computer power we're given \\nwill go to waste. I expect that, as with the stupendous speed of the underlying hardware, \\nparallelism will be something that is available if you ask for it explicitly, but ordinarily not used. \\nThis implies that the kind of parallelism we have in a hundred years will not, except in special \\napplications, be massive parallelism.

It would be premature optimization if it did.\\nHow many programming languages will there be in a hundred years? There seem to be a huge \\nnumber of new programming languages lately. Part of the reason is that faster hardware has \\nallowed programmers to make different tradeoffs between speed and convenience, depending \\non the application.

So, since I'm optimistic, I'm going to predict \\nthat despite the huge gap they'll have between acceptable and maximal efficiency, \\nprogrammers in a hundred years will have languages that can span most of it.\\nAs this gap widens, profilers will become increasingly important.

I think such embedded languages are a great idea, and I expect them to proliferate. \\nBut I expect them to be written as thin enough skins that users can see the general-purpose \\nlanguage underneath.\\nWho will design the languages of the future? One of the most exciting trends in the last ten \\nyears has been the rise of open-source languages like Perl, Python, and Ruby. Language \\ndesign is being taken over by hackers.

But in a typical \\nAmerican secondary school, being smart is likely to make your life difficult. Why?\\nThe key to this mystery is to rephrase the question slightly. Why don't smart kids make \\nthemselves popular? If they're so smart, why don't they figure out how popularity works and \\nbeat the system, just as they do for standardized tests?\\nOne argument says that this would be impossible, that the smart kids are unpopular because \\nthe other kids envy them for being smart, and nothing they could do could make them popular.

And \\nin any case, if being smart were really an enviable quality, the girls would have broken ranks. \\nThe guys that guys envy, girls like.\\nIn the schools I went to, being smart just didn't matter much. Kids didn't admire it or despise it. \\nAll other things being equal, they would have preferred to be on the smart side of average \\nrather than the dumb side, but intelligence counted far less than, say, physical appearance, \\ncharisma, or athletic ability.\\nSo if intelligence in itself is not a factor in popularity, why are smart kids so consistently \\nunpopular?

Telling me \\nthat I didn't want to be popular would have seemed like telling someone dying of thirst in a \\ndesert that he didn't want a glass of water. Of course I wanted to be popular.\\nBut in fact I didn't, not enough. There was something else I wanted more: to be smart. Not \\nsimply to do well in school, though that counted for something, but to design beautiful rockets, \\nor to write well, or to understand how to program computers. In general, to make great things.\\nAt the time I never tried to separate my wants and weigh them against one another. If I had, I \\nwould have seen that being smart was more important.

To them the thought \\nof average intelligence is unbearable. But most kids would take that deal. For half of them, it \\nwould be a step up. Even for someone in the eightieth percentile (assuming, as everyone \\nseemed to then, that intelligence is a scalar), who wouldn't drop thirty points in exchange for \\nbeing loved and admired by everyone?\\nAnd that, I think, is the root of the problem.

And popularity is not something you can do in \\nyour spare time, not in the fiercely competitive environment of an American secondary school.\\nAlberti,\", ', \\ncertainly, but they want even more to be smart. And popularity is not something you can do in \\nyour spare time, not in the fiercely competitive environment of an American secondary school.\\nAlberti, arguably the archetype of the Renaissance Man, writes that \"no art, however minor, \\ndemands less than total dedication if you want to excel in it.\" I wonder if anyone in the world \\nworks harder at anything than American school kids work at popularity. Navy SEALs and \\nneurosurgery residents seem slackers by comparison. They occasionally take vacations; some \\neven have hobbies. An American teenager may work at being popular every waking hour, 365 \\ndays a year.\\nI don\\'t mean to suggest they do this consciously. Some of them truly are little Machiavellis, but \\nwhat I really mean here is that teenagers are always on duty as conformists.\\nFor example, teenage kids pay a great deal of attention to clothes. They don\\'t consciously dress \\nto be popular. They dress to look good. But to who?

And so every effort they make to do things \"right\" is also, consciously or \\nnot, an effort to be more popular.\\nNerds don\\'t realize this. They don\\'t realize that it takes work to be popular. In general, people \\noutside some very demanding field don\\'t realize the extent to which success depends on \\nconstant (though often unconscious) effort. For example, most people seem to consider the \\nability to draw as some kind of innate quality, like being tall.

Their \\nattention is drawn to books or the natural world, not fashions and parties. They\\'re like someone \\ntrying to play soccer while balancing a glass of water on his head. Other players who can focus \\ntheir whole attention on the game beat them effortlessly, and wonder why they seem so \\nincapable.\\nEven if nerds cared as much as other kids about popularity, being popular would be more work \\nfor them.

Life \\nat that age revolves far more around popularity than before or after.\\nBefore that, kids' lives are dominated by their parents, not by other kids. Kids do care what their \\npeers think in elementary school, but this isn't their whole life, as it later becomes.\\nAround the age of eleven, though, kids seem to start treating their family as a day job. They \\ncreate a new world among themselves, and standing in this world is what matters, not standing \\nin their family. Indeed, being in trouble in their family can win them points in the world they care \\nabout.\\nThe problem is, the world these kids create for themselves is at first a very crude one. If you \\nleave a bunch of eleven-year-olds to their own devices, what you get is Lord of the Flies. Like a \\nlot of American kids, I read this book in school.

I wish they had just told us outright that we were \\nsavages and our world was stupid.\\nNerds would find their unpopularity more bearable if it merely caused them to be ignored. \\nUnfortunately, to be unpopular in school is to be actively persecuted.\\nWhy? Once again, anyone currently in school might think this a strange question to ask. How \\ncould things be any other way? But they could be. Adults don't normally persecute nerds. Why \\ndo teenage kids do it?\\nPartly because teenagers are still half children, and many children are just intrinsically cruel. \\nSome torture nerds for the same reason they pull the legs off spiders.

Before you develop a \\nconscience, torture is amusing.\\nAnother reason kids persecute nerds is to make themselves feel better. When you tread water, \\nyou lift yourself up by pushing water down. Likewise, in any social hierarchy, people unsure of \\ntheir own position will try to emphasize it by maltreating those they think rank below. I've read \\nthat this is why poor whites in the United States are the group most hostile to blacks.\\nBut I think the main reason other kids persecute nerds is that it's part of the mechanism of \\npopularity. Popularity is only partially about individual attractiveness. It's much more about \\nalliances. To become more popular, you need to be constantly doing things that bring you close \\nto other popular people, and nothing brings people closer than a common enemy.\\nLike a pol\", \"ch more about \\nalliances. To become more popular, you need to be constantly doing things that bring you close \\nto other popular people, and nothing brings people closer than a common enemy.\\nLike a politician who wants to distract voters from bad times at home, you can create an enemy \\nif there isn't a real one. By singling out and persecuting a nerd, a group of kids from higher in \\nthe hierarchy create bonds between themselves. Attacking an outsider makes them all insiders. \\nThis is why the worst cases of bullying happen with groups. Ask any nerd: you get much worse \\ntreatment from a group of kids than from any individual bully, however sadistic.\\nIf it's any consolation to the nerds, it's nothing personal. The group of kids who band together to \\npick on you are doing the same thing, and for the same reason, as a bunch of guys who get \\ntogether to go hunting. They don't actually hate you.

They don't actually hate you. They just need something to chase.\\nBecause they're at the bottom of the scale, nerds are a safe target for the entire school. If I \\nremember correctly, the most popular kids don't persecute nerds; they don't need to stoop to \\nsuch things. Most of the persecution comes from kids lower down, the nervous middle classes.\\nThe trouble is, there are a lot of them. The distribution of popularity is not a pyramid, but tapers \\nat the bottom like a pear. The least popular group is quite small. (I believe we were the only D \\ntable in our cafeteria map.) So there are more people who want to pick on nerds than there are \\nnerds.\\nAs well as gaining points by distancing oneself from unpopular kids, one loses points by being \\nclose to them.

Unpopularity is a \\ncommunicable disease; kids too nice to pick on nerds will still ostracize them in self-defense.\\nIt's no wonder, then, that smart kids tend to be unhappy in middle school and high school. Their \\nother interests leave them little attention to spare for popularity, and since popularity resembles \\na zero-sum game, this in turn makes them targets for the whole school. And the strange thing \\nis, this nightmare scenario happens without any conscious malice, merely because of the \\nshape of the situation.\\nFor me the worst stretch was junior high, when kid culture was new and harsh, and the \\nspecialization that would later gradually separate the smarter kids had barely begun.

And, like prisoners, the culture we \\ncreated was barbaric.\\nWhy is the real world more hospitable to nerds? It might seem that the answer is simply that it's \\npopulated by adults, who are too mature to pick on one another. But I don't think this is true. \\nAdults in prison certainly pick on one another.

When I read the papers I found out why. Pantel \\nand Lin's filter was the more effective of the two, but it only caught 92% of spam, with 1.16% \\nfalse positives.\\nWhen I tried writing a Bayesian spam filter, it caught 99.5% of spam with less than .03% false \\npositives [4]. It's always alarming when two people trying the same experiment get widely \\ndivergent results. It's especially alarming here because those two sets of numbers might yield \\nopposite conclusions. Different users have different requirements, but I think for many people a \\nfiltering rate of 92% with 1.16% false positives means that filtering is not an acceptable solution, \\nwhereas 99.5% with less than .03% false positives means that it is.\\nSo why did we get such different numbers? I haven't tried to reproduce Pantel and Lin's results, \\nbut from reading the paper I see five things that probably account for the difference.\\nOne is simply that they trained their filter on very l\", \"s? I haven't tried to reproduce Pantel and Lin's results, \\nbut from reading the paper I see five things that probably account for the difference.\\nOne is simply that they trained their filter on very little data: 160 spam and 466 nonspam mails. \\nFilter performance should still be climbing with data sets that small. So their numbers may not \\neven be an accurate measure of the performance of their algorithm, let alone of Bayesian spam \\nfiltering in general.\\nBut I think the most important difference is probably that they ignored message headers. To \\nanyone who has worked on spam filters, this will seem a perverse decision. And yet in the very \\nfirst filters I tried writing, I ignored the headers too. Why? Because I wanted to keep the problem \\nneat. I didn't know much about mail headers then, and they seemed to me full of random stuff. \\nThere is a lesson here for filter writers: don't ignore data. You'd think this lesson would be too \\nobvious to mention, but I've had to learn it several tim\", \"nd they seemed to me full of random stuff. \\nThere is a lesson here for filter writers: don't ignore data. You'd think this lesson would be too \\nobvious to mention, but I've had to learn it several times.\\nThird, Pantel and Lin stemmed the tokens, meaning they reduced e.g. both ``mailing'' and \\n``mailed'' to the root ``mail''. They may have felt they were forced to do this by the small size of \\ntheir corpus, but if so this is a kind of premature optimization.\\nFourth, they calculated probabilities differently. They used all the tokens, whereas I only use the \\n15 most significant. If you use all the tokens you'll tend to miss longer spams, the type where \\nsomeone tells you their life story up to the point where they got rich from some multilevel \\nmarketing scheme. And such an algorithm would be easy for spammers to spoof: just add a big \\nchunk of random text to counterbalance the spam terms.\\nFinally, they didn't bias against false positives.

I think any spam filtering algorithm ought to have \\na convenient knob you can twist to decrease the false positive rate at the expense of the \\nfiltering rate. I do this by counting the occurrences of tokens in the nonspam corpus double. \\nI don't think it's a good idea to treat spam filtering as a straight text classification problem. You \\ncan use text classification techniques, but solutions can and should reflect the fact that the text \\nis email, and spam in particular. Email is not just text; it has structure. Spam filtering is not just \\nclassification, because false positives are so much worse than false negatives that you should \\ntreat them as a different kind of error. And the source of error is not just random variation, but a \\nlive human spammer working actively to defeat your filter.\\nTokens\\nAnother project I heard about after th\", \"them as a different kind of error. And the source of error is not just random variation, but a \\nlive human spammer working actively to defeat your filter.\\nTokens\\nAnother project I heard about after the Slashdot article was Bill Yerazunis' CRM114 [5]. This is \\nthe counterexample to the design principle I just mentioned. It's a straight text classifier, but \\nsuch a stunningly effective one that it manages to filter spam almost perfectly without even \\nknowing that's what it's doing.\\nOnce I understood how CRM114 worked, it seemed inevitable that I would eventually have to \\nmove from filtering based on single words to an approach like this. But first, I thought, I'll see \\nhow far I can get with single words. And the answer is, surprisingly far.\\nMostly I've been working on smarter tokenization. On current spam, I've been able to achieve \\nfiltering rates that approach CRM114's.

These techniques are mostly orthogonal to Bill's; an \\noptimal solution might incorporate both.\\n``A Plan for Spam'' uses a very simple definition of a token. Letters, digits, dashes, \\napostrophes, and dollar signs are constituent characters, and everything else is a token \\nseparator. I also ignored case.\\nNow I have a more complicated definition of a token: Case is preserved.\\n Exclamation points are constituent characters.\\n Periods and commas are constituents if they occur between two digits. This lets me get ip \\naddresses and prices intact.\\n A price range like $20-25 yields two tokens, $20 and $25.\\n Tokens that occur within the To, From, Subject, and Return-Path lines, or within urls, get \\nmarked accordingly. E.g. ``foo'' in the Subject line becomes ``Subject*foo''. (The asterisk could \\nbe any character you don't allow as a constituent.)

(The asterisk could \\nbe any character you don't allow as a constituent.) Such measures increase the filter's \\nvocabulary, which makes it more discriminating. For example, in the current filter, ``free'' in the \\nSubject line has a spam probability of 98%, whereas the same token in the body has a spam \\nprobability of only 65%.\\nHere are some of the current probabilities [6]:\\nSubject*FREE 0.9999 free!! 0.9999 To*free 0.9998 Subject*free 0.9782 free! 0.9199 Free \\n0.9198 Url*free 0.9091 FREE 0.8747 From*free 0.7636 free 0.6546 In the Plan for Spam filter, \\nall these tokens would have had the same probability, .7602. That filter recognized about \\n23,000 tokens. The current one recognizes about 187,000.\\nThe disadvantage of having a larger universe of tokens is that there is more chance of misses. \\nSpreading your corpus out over more tokens has the same effect as making it smaller. If you \\nconsider exclamation points as constituents, f\", \" universe of tokens is that there is more chance of misses. \\nSpreading your corpus out over more tokens has the same effect as making it smaller. If you \\nconsider exclamation points as constituents, for example, then you could end up not having a \\nspam probability for free with seven exclamation points, even though you know that free with \\njust two exclamation points has a probability of 99.99%.\\nOne solution to this is what I call degeneration. If you can't find an exact match for a token, treat \\nit as if it were a less specific version. I consider terminal exclamation points, uppercase letters, \\nand occurring in one of the five marked contexts as making a token more specific. For example, \\nif I don't find a probability for ``Subject*free!'', I look for probabilities for ``Subject*free'', ``free!'', \\nand ``free'', and take whichever one is farthest from .5.\\nHere are the alternatives [7] considered if the filter sees ``FREE!!!'' in the Subject line and \\ndoesn't have a probability for it\", \"``free!'', \\nand ``free'', and take whichever one is farthest from .5.\\nHere are the alternatives [7] considered if the filter sees ``FREE!!!'' in the Subject line and \\ndoesn't have a probability for it.\\nSubject*Free!!! Subject*free!!! Subject*FREE! Subject*Free! Subject*free! Subject*FREE \\nSubject*Free Subject*free FREE!!! Free!!! free!!! FREE! Free! free! FREE Free free If you do \\nthis, be sure to consider versions with initial caps as well as all uppercase and all lowercase. \\nSpams tend to have more sentences in imperative mood, and in those the first word is a verb. \\nSo verbs with initial caps have higher spam probabilities than they would in all lowercase. In my \\nfilter, the spam probability of ``Act'' is 98% and for ``act'' only 62%.\\nIf you increase your filter's vocabulary, you can end up counting the same word multiple times, \\naccording to your old definition of ``same''. Logically, they're not the same token anymore. But if \\nthis still bothers you, let me add from experience tha\", \"d up counting the same word multiple times, \\naccording to your old definition of ``same''. Logically, they're not the same token anymore. But if \\nthis still bothers you, let me add from experience that the words you seem to be counting \\nmultiple times tend to be exactly the ones you'd want to.\\nAnother effect of a larger vocabulary is that when you look at an incoming mail you find more \\ninteresting tokens, meaning those with probabilities far from .5. I use the 15 most interesting to \\ndecide if mail is spam. But you can run into a problem when you use a fixed number like this. If \\nyou find a lot of maximally interesting tokens, the result can end up being decided by whatever \\nrandom factor determines the ordering of equally interesting tokens. One way to deal with this is \\nto treat some as more interesting than others.\\nFor example, the token ``dalco'' occurs 3 times in my spam corpus and never in my legitimate \\ncorpus. The token ``Url*optmails'' (meaning ``optmails'' within a url) occu\", \" more interesting than others.\\nFor example, the token ``dalco'' occurs 3 times in my spam corpus and never in my legitimate \\ncorpus. The token ``Url*optmails'' (meaning ``optmails'' within a url) occurs 1223 times. And yet, \\nas I used to calculate probabilities for tokens, both would have the same spam probability, the \\nthreshold of .99.\\nThat doesn't feel right. There are theoretical arguments for giving these two tokens substantially \\ndifferent probabilities (Pantel and Lin do), but I haven't tried that yet. It does seem at least that if \\nwe find more than 15 tokens that only occur in one corpus or the other, we ought to give priority \\nto the ones that occur a lot. So now there are two threshold values. For tokens that occur only in \\nthe spam corpus, the probability is .9999 if they occur more than 10 times and .9998 otherwise. \\nDitto at the other end of the scale for tokens found only in the legitimate corpus.\\nI may later scale token probabilities substantially, but this tiny amount \", \" more than 10 times and .9998 otherwise. \\nDitto at the other end of the scale for tokens found only in the legitimate corpus.\\nI may later scale token probabilities substantially, but this tiny amount of scaling at least \\nensures that tokens get sorted the right way.\\nAnother possibility would be to consider not just 15 tokens, but all the tokens over a certain \\nthreshold of interestingness. Steven Hauser does this in his statistical spam filter [8]. If you use \\na threshold, make it very high, or spammers could spoof you by packing messages with more \\ninnocent words.\\nFinally, what should one do about html? I've tried the whole spectrum of options, from ignoring \\nit to parsing it all. Ignoring html is a bad idea, because it's full of useful spam signs. But if you \\nparse it all, your filter might degenerate into a mere html recognizer. The most effective \\napproach seems to be the middle course, to notice some tokens but not others. I look at a, img, \\nand font tags, and ignore the rest. Lin\", \"ght degenerate into a mere html recognizer. The most effective \\napproach seems to be the middle course, to notice some tokens but not others. I look at a, img, \\nand font tags, and ignore the rest. Links and images you should certainly look at, because they \\ncontain urls.\\nI could probably be smarter about dealing with html, but I don't think it's worth putting a lot of \\ntime into this. Spams full of html are easy to filter. The smarter spammers already avoid it. So \\nperformance in the future should not depend much on how you deal with html.\\nPerformance\\nBetween December 10 2002 and January 10 2003 I got about 1750 spams. Of these, 4 got \\nthrough. That's a filtering rate of about 99.75%.\\nTwo of the four spams I missed got through because they happened to use words that occur \\noften in my legitimate email.\\nThe third was one of those that exploit an insecure cgi script to send mail to third parties. \\nThey're hard to filter based just on the content because the headers are innocent and they'\", \"timate email.\\nThe third was one of those that exploit an insecure cgi script to send mail to third parties. \\nThey're hard to filter based just on the content because the headers are innocent and they're \\ncareful about the words they use. Even so I can usually catch them. This one squeaked by with \\na probability of .88, just under the threshold of .9.\\nOf course, looking at multiple token sequences would catch it easily. ``Below is the result of \\nyour feedback form'' is an instant giveaway.\\nThe fourth spam was what I call a spam-of-the-future, because this is what I expect spam to \\nevolve into: some completely neutral text followed by a url. In this case it was was from \\nsomeone saying they had finally finished their homepage and would I go look at it. (The page \\nwas of course an ad for a porn site.)\\nIf the spammers are careful about the headers and use a fresh url, there is nothing in spam-of-\\nthe-future for filters to notice.

We can of course counter by sending a crawler to look at the \\npage. But that might not be necessary. The response rate for spam-of-the-future must be low, or \\neveryone would be doing it. If it's low enough, it won't pay for spammers to send it, and we won't \\nhave to work too hard on filtering it.\\nNow for the really shocking news: during that same one-month period I got three false positives.\\nIn a way it's a relief to get some false positives. When I wrote ``A Plan for Spam'' I hadn't had \\nany, and I didn't know what they'd be like. Now that I've had a few, I'm relieved to find they're not \\nas bad as I feared. False positives yielded by statistical filters turn out to be mails that sound a \\nlot like spam, and these tend to be the ones you would least mind missing [9].\\nTwo of the false positives were newsletters from companies I've bought things from\", \"ers turn out to be mails that sound a \\nlot like spam, and these tend to be the ones you would least mind missing [9].\\nTwo of the false positives were newsletters from companies I've bought things from. I never \\nasked to receive them, so arguably they were spams, but I count them as false positives \\nbecause I hadn't been deleting them as spams before. The reason the filters caught them was \\nthat both companies in January switched to commercial email senders instead of sending the \\nmails from their own servers, and both the headers and the bodies became much spammier.\\nThe third false positive was a bad one, though. It was from someone in Egypt and written in all \\nuppercase. This was a direct result of making tokens case sensitive; the Plan for Spam filter \\nwouldn't have caught it.\\nIt's hard to say what the overall false positive rate is, because we're up in the noise, statistically. \\nAnyone who has worked on filters (at least, effective filters) will be aware of this problem.

Arguably, these are neither my spam nor my nonspam mail.\\nAnother false positive was from a vice president at Virtumundo. I wrote to them pretending to be \\na customer, and since the reply came back through Virtumundo's mail servers it had the most \\nincriminating headers imaginable.

The other two were a notice that something I bought was back-ordered, \\nand a party reminder from Evite.\\nI don't think this number can be trusted, partly because the sample is so small, and partly \\nbecause I think I can fix the filter not to catch some of these.\\nFalse positives seem to me a different kind of error from false negatives. Filtering rate is a \\nmeasure of performance. False positives I consider more like bugs. I approach improving the \\nfiltering rate as optimization, and decreasing false positives as debugging.\\nSo these five false positives are my bug list.

As with html, the e\", \"e positives are my bug list. For example, the mail from Egypt got nailed \\nbecause the uppercase text made it look to the filter like a Nigerian spam. This really is kind of \\na bug. As with html, the email being all uppercase is really conceptually one feature, not one for \\neach word. I need to handle case in a more sophisticated way.\\nSo what to make of this .06%? Not much, I think. You could treat it as an upper bound, bearing \\nin mind the small sample size. But at this stage it is more a measure of the bugs in my \\nimplementation than some intrinsic false positive rate of Bayesian filtering.\\nFuture\\nWhat next? Filtering is an optimization problem, and the key to optimization is profiling. Don't try \\nto guess where your code is slow, because you'll guess wrong.

But \\nworking on this is not my first priority, because I still have no trouble catching these spams [10].\\nThere are two kinds of spams I currently do have trouble with. One is the type that pretends to \\nbe an email from a woman inviting you to go chat with her or see her profile on a dating site. \\nThese get through because they're the one type of sales pitch you can make without using \\nsales talk. They use the same vocabulary as ordinary email.\\nThe other kind of spams I have trouble filtering are those from companies in e.g. Bulgaria \\noffering contract programming services.

I think if I look closer I'll be able to find statistical \\ndifferences between these and my real mail. The style of writing is certainly different, though it \\nmay take multiword filtering to catch that. Also, I notice they tend to repeat the url, and someone \\nincluding a url in a legitimate mail wouldn't do that [11].\\nThe outsourcing type are going to be hard to catch. Even if you sent a crawler to the site, you \\nwouldn't find a smoking statistical gun. Maybe the only answer is a central list of domains \\nadvertised in spams [12].

I don\\'t know. Right now, for me personally, \\nspam is not a problem. But spammers haven\\'t yet made a serious effort to spoof statistical \\nfilters. What will happen when they do?\\nI\\'m not optimistic about filters that work at the network level [13]. When there is a static obstacle \\nworth getting past, spammers are pretty efficient at getting past it. There is already a company \\ncalled Assurance Systems that will run your mail through Spamassassin and tell you whether it \\nwill get filtered out.\\nNetwork-level filters won\\'t be completely useless.

But anyone willing to falsify headers or use open relays, presumably including \\nmost porn spammers, should be able to get some message past network-level filters if they \\nwant to. (By no means the message they\\'d like to send though, which is something.)\\nThe kind of filters I\\'m optimistic about are ones that calculate probabilities based on each \\nindividual user\\'s mail. These can be much more effective, not only in avoiding false positives, \\nbut in filtering too: for example, finding the recipient\\'s email address base-64 encoded \\nanywhere in a message is a very good spam indicator.\\nBut the real advantage of individual filters is that they\\'ll all be different.

I just want to make a language that will be good to program in. \\nIn some ways, this assumption makes life a lot easier.\\nThe difference between design and research seems to be a question of new versus good. \\nDesign doesn\\'t have to be new, but it has to be good. Research doesn\\'t have to be good, but it \\nhas to be new. I think these two paths converge at the top: the best design surpasses its \\npredecessors by using new ideas, and the best research solves problems that are not only new, \\nbut actually worth solving. So ultimately we\\'re aiming ', 'nverge at the top: the best design surpasses its \\npredecessors by using new ideas, and the best research solves problems that are not only new, \\nbut actually worth solving. So ultimately we\\'re aiming for the same destination, just approaching \\nit from different directions.\\nWhat I\\'m going to talk about today is what your target looks like from the back. What do you do \\ndifferently when you treat programming languages as a design problem instead of a research \\ntopic?\\nThe biggest difference is that you focus more on the user. Design begins by asking, who is this \\nfor and what do they need from it? A good architect, for example, does not begin by creating a \\ndesign that he then imposes on the users, but by studying the intended users and figuring out \\nwhat they need.\\nNotice I said \"what they need,\" not \"what they want.\" I don\\'t mean to give the impression that \\nworking as a designer means working as a sort of short-order cook, making whatever the client \\ntells you to. This varies from fiel', 'eed,\" not \"what they want.\" I don\\'t mean to give the impression that \\nworking as a designer means working as a sort of short-order cook, making whatever the client \\ntells you to. This varies from field to field in the arts, but I don\\'t think there is any field in which \\nthe best work is done by the people who just make exactly what the customers tell them to.\\nThe customer is always right in the sense that the measure of good design is how well it works \\nfor the user. If you make a novel that bores everyone, or a chair that\\'s horribly uncomfortable to \\nsit in, then you\\'ve done a bad job, period. It\\'s no defense to say that the novel or the chair is \\ndesigned according to the most advanced theoretical principles.\\nAnd yet, making what works for the user doesn\\'t mean simply making what the user tells you to. \\nUsers don\\'t know what all the choices are, and are often mistaken about what they really want.\\nThe answer to the paradox, I think, is that you have to design for the user, but you hav', \"r tells you to. \\nUsers don't know what all the choices are, and are often mistaken about what they really want.\\nThe answer to the paradox, I think, is that you have to design for the user, but you have to \\ndesign what the user needs, not simply what he says he wants. It's much like being a doctor. \\nYou can't just treat a patient's symptoms. When a patient tells you his symptoms, you have to \\nfigure out what's actually wrong with him, and treat that.\\nThis focus on the user is a kind of axiom from which most of the practice of good design can be \\nderived, and around which most design issues center.\\nIf good design must do what the user needs, who is the user? When I say that design must be \\nfor users, I don't mean to imply that good design aims at some kind of lowest common \\ndenominator. You can pick any group of users you want. If you're designing a tool, for example, \\nyou can design it for anyone from beginners to experts, and what's good design for one group \\nmight be bad for another. \", \"can pick any group of users you want. If you're designing a tool, for example, \\nyou can design it for anyone from beginners to experts, and what's good design for one group \\nmight be bad for another. The point is, you have to pick some group of users. I don't think you \\ncan even talk about good or bad design except with reference to some intended user.\\nYou're most likely to get good design if the intended users include the designer himself. When \\nyou design something for a group that doesn't include you, it tends to be for people you \\nconsider to be less sophisticated than you, not more sophisticated.\\nThat's a problem, because looking down on the user, however benevolently, seems inevitably to \\ncorrupt the designer. I suspect that very few housing projects in the US were designed by \\narchitects who expected to live in them. You can see the same thing in programming languages. \\nC, Lisp, and Smalltalk were created for their own designers to use. Cobol, Ada, and Java, were \\ncreated for ot\", \"tects who expected to live in them.

Cobol, Ada, and Java, were \\ncreated for other people to use.\\nIf you think you're designing something for idiots, the odds are that you're not designing \\nsomething good, even for idiots.\\nEven if you're designing something for the most sophisticated users, though, you're still \\ndesigning for humans. It's different in research. In math you don't choose abstractions because \\nthey're easy for humans to understand; you choose whichever make the proof shorter. I think \\nthis is true for the sciences generally. Scientific ideas are not meant to be ergonomic.\\nOver in the arts, things are very different. Design is all about people. The human body is a \\nstrange thing, but when you're designing a chair, that's what you're designing for, and there's no \\nway around it. All the arts have to pander to the interests and limitations of humans. In pa\", \"y is a \\nstrange thing, but when you're designing a chair, that's what you're designing for, and there's no \\nway around it. All the arts have to pander to the interests and limitations of humans. In painting, \\nfor example, all other things being equal a painting with people in it will be more interesting than \\none without. It is not merely an accident of history that the great paintings of the Renaissance \\nare all full of people. If they hadn't been, painting as a medium wouldn't have the prestige that it \\ndoes.\\nLike it or not, programming languages are also for people, and I suspect the human brain is just \\nas lumpy and idiosyncratic as the human body. Some ideas are easy for people to grasp and \\nsome aren't. For example, we seem to have a very limited capacity for dealing with detail. It's \\nthis fact that makes programing languages a good idea in the first place; if we could handle the \\ndetail, we could just program in machine language.\\nRemember, too, that languages are not primarily \", \"s \\nthis fact that makes programing languages a good idea in the first place; if we could handle the \\ndetail, we could just program in machine language.\\nRemember, too, that languages are not primarily a form for finished programs, but something \\nthat programs have to be developed in. Anyone in the arts could tell you that you might want \\ndifferent mediums for the two situations. Marble, for example, is a nice, durable medium for \\nfinished ideas, but a hopelessly inflexible one for developing new ideas.\\nA program, like a proof, is a pruned version of a tree that in the past has had false starts \\nbranching off all over it. So the test of a language is not simply how clean the finished program \\nlooks in it, but how clean the path to the finished program was. A design choice that gives you \\nelegant finished programs may not give you an elegant design process. For example, I've \\nwritten a few macro-defining macros full of nested backquotes that look now like little gems, but \\nwriting them to\", \"gant finished programs may not give you an elegant design process. For example, I've \\nwritten a few macro-defining macros full of nested backquotes that look now like little gems, but \\nwriting them took hours of the ugliest trial and error, and frankly, I'm still not entirely sure they're \\ncorrect.\\nWe often act as if the test of a language were how good finished programs look in it. It seems \\nso convincing when you see the same program written in two languages, and one version is \\nmuch shorter. When you approach the problem from the direction of the arts, you're less likely \\nto depend on this sort of test. You don't want to end up with a programming language like \\nmarble.\\nFor example, it is a huge win in developing software to have an interactive toplevel, what in Lisp \\nis called a read-eval-print loop. And when you have one this has real effects on the design of \\nthe language. It would not work well for a language where you have to declare variables before \\nusing them, for example. Wh\", \"al-print loop. And when you have one this has real effects on the design of \\nthe language. It would not work well for a language where you have to declare variables before \\nusing them, for example. When you're just typing expressions into the toplevel, you want to be \\nable to set x to some value and then start doing things to x. You don't want to have to declare \\nthe type of x first. You may dispute either of the premises, but if a language has to have a \\ntoplevel to be convenient, and mandatory type declarations are incompatible with a toplevel, \\nthen no language that makes type declarations mandatory could be convenient to program in.\\nIn practice, to get good design you have to get close, and stay close, to your users. You have to \\ncalibrate your ideas on actual users constantly, especially in the beginning. One of the reasons \\nJane Austen's novels are so good is that she read them out loud to her family. That's why she \\nnever sinks into self-indulgently arty descriptions of landscap\", 'lly in the beginning. One of the reasons \\nJane Austen\\'s novels are so good is that she read them out loud to her family. That\\'s why she \\nnever sinks into self-indulgently arty descriptions of landscapes, or pretentious philosophizing. \\n(The philosophy\\'s there, but it\\'s woven into the story instead of being pasted onto it like a label.) \\nIf you open an average \"literary\" novel and imagine reading it out loud to your friends as \\nsomething you\\'d written, you\\'ll feel all too keenly what an imposition that kind of thing is upon \\nthe reader.\\nIn the software world, this idea is known as Worse is Better. Actually, there are several ideas \\nmixed together in the concept of Worse is Better, which is why people are still arguing about \\nwhether worse is actually better or not. But one of the main ideas in that mix is that if you\\'re \\nbuilding something new, you should get a prototype in front of users as soon as possible.\\nThe alternative approach might be called the Hail Mary strategy. Instead of ge', \" in that mix is that if you're \\nbuilding something new, you should get a prototype in front of users as soon as possible.\\nThe alternative approach might be called the Hail Mary strategy. Instead of getting a prototype \\nout quickly and gradually refining it, you try to create the complete, finished, product in one long \\ntouchdown pass. As far as I know, this is a recipe for disaster. Countless startups destroyed \\nthemselves this way during the Internet bubble. I've never heard of a case where it worked.\\nWhat people outside the software world may not realize is that Worse is Better is found \\nthroughout the arts. In drawing, for example, the idea was discovered during the Renaissance. \\nNow almost every drawing teacher will tell you that the right way to get an accurate drawing is \\nnot to work your way slowly around the contour of an object, because errors will accumulate \\nand you'll find at the end that the lines don't meet.

Typefaces to \\nbe cut in metal were initially designed with a brush on paper. Statues to be cast in bronze were \\nmodelled in wax. Patterns to be embroidered on tapestries were drawn on paper with ink wash. \\nBuildings to be constructed from stone were tested on a smaller scale in wood.\\nWhat made oil paint so exciting, when it first became popular in the fifteenth century, was that \\nyou could actually make the finished work from the prototype.

It lets you take \\nadvantage of new insights you have along the way. But perhaps even more important, it's good \\nfor morale.\\nMorale is key in design. I'm surprised people don't talk more about it. One of my first drawing \\nteachers told me: if you're bored when you're drawing something, the drawing will look boring. \\nFor example, suppose you have to draw a building, and you decide to draw each brick \\nindividually. You can do this if you want, but if you get bored halfway through and start making \\nthe bricks mechanically instead of observing each one, the drawing will look worse than if you \\nhad merely suggested the bricks.\\nBuilding something by gradually refi\", ' halfway through and start making \\nthe bricks mechanically instead of observing each one, the drawing will look worse than if you \\nhad merely suggested the bricks.\\nBuilding something by gradually refining a prototype is good for morale because it keeps you \\nengaged. In software, my rule is: always have working code. If you\\'re writing something that \\nyou\\'ll be able to test in an hour, then you have the prospect of an immediate reward to motivate \\nyou. The same is true in the arts, and particularly in oil painting. Most painters start with a blurry \\nsketch and gradually refine it. If you work this way, then in principle you never have to end the \\nday with something that actually looks unfinished. Indeed, there is even a saying among \\npainters: \"A painting is never finished, you just stop working on it.\" This idea will be familiar to \\nanyone who has worked on software.\\nMorale is another reason that it\\'s hard to design something for an unsophisticated user.

It\\'s hard \\nto stay interested in something you don\\'t like yourself.

But it\\'s not just the user who\\'s human. The designer \\nis human too.\\nNotice all this time I\\'ve been talking about \"the designer.\" Design usually has to be under the \\ncontrol of a single person to be any good. And yet it seems to be possible for several people to \\ncollaborate on a research project. This seems to me one of the most interesting differences \\nbetween research and design.\\nThere have been famous instances of collaboration in the arts, but most of them seem to have \\nbeen cases of molecular bonding rather than nuclear fusion.

Using a slightly tweaked (as \\ndescribed below) Bayesian filter, we now miss less than 5 per 1000 spams, with 0 false \\npositives.\\nThe statistical approach is not usually the first one people try when they write spam filters.

I can \\nfilter out that stuff with about one line of code.\\nAnd so you do, and in the beginning it works. A few simple rules will take a big bite out of your \\nincoming spam. Merely looking for the word \"click\" will catch 79.7% of the emails in my spam \\ncorpus, with only 1.2% false positives.\\nI spent about six months writing software that looked for individual spam features before I tried \\nthe statistical approach.

And strangely enough, the better your spam filters get, the more dangerous false \\npositives become, because when the filters are really good, users will be more likely to ignore \\neverything they catch.\\nI don't know why I avoided trying the statistical approach for so long. I think it was because I got \\naddicted to trying to identify spam features myself, as if I were playing some kind of competitive \\ngame with the spammers. (Nonhackers don't often realize this, but most hackers are very \\ncompetitive.)

(Nonhackers don\\'t often realize this, but most hackers are very \\ncompetitive.) When I did try statistical analysis, I found immediately that it was much cleverer \\nthan I had been. It discovered, of course, that terms like \"virtumundo\" and \"teens\" were good \\nindicators of spam. But it also discovered that \"per\" and \"FL\" and \"ff0000\" are good indicators of \\nspam. In fact, \"ff0000\" (html for bright red) turns out to be as good an indicator of spam as any \\npornographic term.\\n_ _ _\\nHere\\'s a sketch of how I do statistical filtering. I start with one corpus of spam and one of \\nnonspam mail. At the moment each one has about 4000 messages in it. I scan the entire text, \\nincluding headers and embedded html and javascript, of each message in each corpus. I \\ncurrently consider alphanumeric characters, dashes, apostrophes, and dollar signs to be part of \\ntokens, and everything else to be a token separator. (There is', \"ript, of each message in each corpus. I \\ncurrently consider alphanumeric characters, dashes, apostrophes, and dollar signs to be part of \\ntokens, and everything else to be a token separator. (There is probably room for improvement \\nhere.) I ignore tokens that are all digits, and I also ignore html comments, not even considering \\nthem as token separators.\\nI count the number of times each token (ignoring case, currently) occurs in each corpus. At this \\nstage I end up with two large hash tables, one for each corpus, mapping tokens to number of \\noccurrences.\\nNext I create a third hash table, this time mapping each token to the probability that an email \\ncontaining it is a spam, which I calculate as follows [1]: (let ((g (* 2 (or (gethash word good) 0))) \\n(b (or (gethash word bad) 0))) (unless (< (+ g b) 5) (max .01 (min .99 (float (/ (min 1 (/ b nbad)) \\n(+ (min 1 (/ g ngood)) (min 1 (/ b nbad))))))))) where word is the token whose probability we're \\ncalculating, good and bad are the hash t\", \"(< (+ g b) 5) (max .01 (min .99 (float (/ (min 1 (/ b nbad)) \\n(+ (min 1 (/ g ngood)) (min 1 (/ b nbad))))))))) where word is the token whose probability we're \\ncalculating, good and bad are the hash tables I created in the first step, and ngood and nbad \\nare the number of nonspam and spam messages respectively.\\nI explained this as code to show a couple of important details. I want to bias the probabilities \\nslightly to avoid false positives, and by trial and error I've found that a good way to do it is to \\ndouble all the numbers in good. This helps to distinguish between words that occasionally do \\noccur in legitimate email and words that almost never do. I only consider words that occur more \\nthan five times in total (actually, because of the doubling, occurring three times in nonspam mail \\nwould be enough). And then there is the question of what probability to assign to words that \\noccur in one corpus but not the other. Again by trial and error I chose .01 and .99. There may \\nbe room\", \"l \\nwould be enough). And then there is the question of what probability to assign to words that \\noccur in one corpus but not the other. Again by trial and error I chose .01 and .99. There may \\nbe room for tuning here, but as the corpus grows such tuning will happen automatically anyway.\\nThe especially observant will notice that while I consider each corpus to be a single long \\nstream of text for purposes of counting occurrences, I use the number of emails in each, rather \\nthan their combined length, as the divisor in calculating spam probabilities. This adds another \\nslight bias to protect against false positives.\\nWhen new mail arrives, it is scanned into tokens, and the most interesting fifteen tokens, where \\ninteresting is measured by how far their spam probability is from a neutral .5, are used to \\ncalculate the probability that the mail is spam. If probs is a list of the fifteen individual \\nprobabilities, you calculate the combined probability thus: (let ((prod (apply #'* probs))) \", \"are used to \\ncalculate the probability that the mail is spam. If probs is a list of the fifteen individual \\nprobabilities, you calculate the combined probability thus: (let ((prod (apply #'* probs))) (/ prod \\n(+ prod (apply #'* (mapcar #'(lambda (x) (- 1 x)) probs))))) One question that arises in practice is \\nwhat probability to assign to a word you've never seen, i.e. one that doesn't occur in the hash \\ntable of word probabilities. I've found, again by trial and error, that .4 is a good number to use. If \\nyou've never seen a word before, it is probably fairly innocent; spam words tend to be all too \\nfamiliar.\\nThere are examples of this algorithm being applied to actual emails in an appendix at the end.\\nI treat mail as spam if the algorithm above gives it a probability of more than .9 of being spam. \\nBut in practice it would not matter much where I put this threshold, because few probabilities \\nend up in the middle of the range.\\n_ _ _\\nOne great advantage of the statistical approach is \", 'eing spam. \\nBut in practice it would not matter much where I put this threshold, because few probabilities \\nend up in the middle of the range.\\n_ _ _\\nOne great advantage of the statistical approach is that you don\\'t have to read so many spams. \\nOver the past six months, I\\'ve read literally thousands of spams, and it is really kind of \\ndemoralizing. Norbert Wiener said if you compete with slaves you become a slave, and there is \\nsomething similarly degrading about competing with spammers. To recognize individual spam \\nfeatures you have to try to get into the mind of the spammer, and frankly I want to spend as little \\ntime inside the minds of spammers as possible.\\nBut the real advantage of the Bayesian approach, of course, is that you know what you\\'re \\nmeasuring.

A \\nprobability can of course be mistaken, but there is little ambiguity about what it means, or how \\nevidence should be combined to calculate it. Based on my corpus, \"sex\" indicates a .97 \\nprobability of the containing email being a spam, whereas \"sexy\" indicates .99 probability. And \\nBayes\\' Rule, equally unambiguous, says that an email containing both words would, in the \\n(unlikely) absence of any other evidence, have a 99.97% chance of being a spam.\\nBecause it is measuring probabilities, the Bayesian approach considers all the evidence in the \\nemail, both good and bad. Words that occur disproportionately rarely in spam (like \"though\" or \\n\"tonight\" or \"appar', 'is measuring probabilities, the Bayesian approach considers all the evidence in the \\nemail, both good and bad. Words that occur disproportionately rarely in spam (like \"though\" or \\n\"tonight\" or \"apparently\") contribute as much to decreasing the probability as bad words like \\n\"unsubscribe\" and \"opt-in\" do to increasing it. So an otherwise innocent email that happens to \\ninclude the word \"sex\" is not going to get tagged as spam.\\nIdeally, of course, the probabilities should be calculated individually for each user. I get a lot of \\nemail containing the word \"Lisp\", and (so far) no spam that does. So a word like that is \\neffectively a kind of password for sending mail to me. In my earlier spam-filtering software, the \\nuser could set up a list of such words and mail containing them would automatically get past \\nthe filters. On my list I put words like \"Lisp\" and also my zipcode, so that (otherwise rather \\nspammy-sounding) receipts from online orders would get through. I thought I was being v', 'ically get past \\nthe filters. On my list I put words like \"Lisp\" and also my zipcode, so that (otherwise rather \\nspammy-sounding) receipts from online orders would get through. I thought I was being very \\nclever, but I found that the Bayesian filter did the same thing for me, and moreover discovered \\nof a lot of words I hadn\\'t thought of.\\nWhen I said at the start that our filters let through less than 5 spams per 1000 with 0 false \\npositives, I\\'m talking about filtering my mail based on a corpus of my mail. But these numbers \\nare not misleading, because that is the approach I\\'m advocating: filter each user\\'s mail based \\non the spam and nonspam mail he receives. Essentially, each user should have two delete \\nbuttons, ordinary delete and delete-as-spam. Anything deleted as spam goes into the spam \\ncorpus, and everything else goes into the nonspam corpus.\\nYou could start users with a seed filter, but ultimately each user should have his own per-word \\nprobabilities based on the actual mail', \" spam \\ncorpus, and everything else goes into the nonspam corpus.\\nYou could start users with a seed filter, but ultimately each user should have his own per-word \\nprobabilities based on the actual mail he receives. This (a) makes the filters more effective, (b) \\nlets each user decide their own precise definition of spam, and (c) perhaps best of all makes it \\nhard for spammers to tune mails to get through the filters. If a lot of the brain of the filter is in the \\nindividual databases, then merely tuning spams to get through the seed filters won't guarantee \\nanything about how well they'll get through individual users' varying and much more trained \\nfilters.\\nContent-based spam filtering is often combined with a whitelist, a list of senders whose mail \\ncan be accepted with no filtering. One easy way to build such a whitelist is to keep a list of \\nevery address the user has ever sent mail to.

I used to think that whitelists would make filtering easier, because you'd only have to \\nfilter email from people you'd never heard from, and someone sending you mail for the first time \\nis constrained by convention in what they can say to you. Someone you already know might \\nsend you an email talking about sex, but someone sending you mail for the first time would not \\nbe likely to. The problem is, people can have more than one email address, so a new from-\\naddress doesn't guarantee that the sender is writing to you for the first time.

It is not unusual for \\nan old friend (especially if he is a hacker) to suddenly send you an email with a new from-\\naddress, so you can\\'t risk false positives by filtering mail from unknown addresses especially \\nstringently.\\nIn a sense, though, my filters do themselves embody a kind of whitelist (and blacklist) because \\nthey are based on entire messages, including the headers. So to that extent they \"know\" the \\nemail addresses of trusted senders and even the routes by which mail gets from them to me. \\nAnd they know the same about spam, including the server names, mailer versions, and \\nprotocols.\\n_ _ _\\nIf I thought that I could keep up current rates of spam filtering, I would consider this problem \\nsolved. But it doesn\\'t mean much to be able to filter out most present-day spam, because spam \\nevolves.

But it doesn\\'t mean much to be able to filter out most present-day spam, because spam \\nevolves. Indeed, most antispam techniques so far have been like pesticides that do nothing \\nmore than create a new, resistant strain of bugs.\\nI\\'m more hopeful about Bayesian filters, because they evolve with the spam. So as spammers \\nstart using \"c0ck\" instead of \"cock\" to evade simple-minded spam filters based on individual \\nwords, Bayesian filters automatically notice. Indeed, \"c0ck\" is far more damning evidence than \\n\"cock\", and Bayesian filters know precisely how much more.\\nStill, anyone who proposes a plan for spam filtering has to be able to answer the question: if the \\nspammers knew exactly what you were doing, how well could they get past you? For example, I \\nthink that if checksum-based spam filtering becomes a serious obstacle, the spammers will just \\nswitch to mad-lib techniques for generating message bodies.\\nTo beat Bayesian filters, it would not be enough for spammers to make thei', \"pam filtering becomes a serious obstacle, the spammers will just \\nswitch to mad-lib techniques for generating message bodies.\\nTo beat Bayesian filters, it would not be enough for spammers to make their emails unique or to \\nstop using individual naughty words. They'd have to make their mails indistinguishable from \\nyour ordinary mail. And this I think would severely constrain them. Spam is mostly sales pitches, \\nso unless your regular mail is all sales pitches, spams will inevitably have a different character. \\nAnd the spammers would also, of course, have to change (and keep changing) their whole \\ninfrastructure, because otherwise the headers would look as bad to the Bayesian filters as ever, \\nno matter what they did to the message body. I don't know enough about the infrastructure that \\nspammers use to know how hard it would be to make the headers look innocent, but my guess \\nis that it would be even harder than making the message look innocent.\\nAssuming they could solve the problem of\", 'ammers use to know how hard it would be to make the headers look innocent, but my guess \\nis that it would be even harder than making the message look innocent.\\nAssuming they could solve the problem of the headers, the spam of the future will probably look \\nsomething like this: Hey there. Thought you should check out the following: http://\\nwww.27meg.com/foo because that is about as much sales pitch as content-based filtering will \\nleave the spammer room to make. (Indeed, it will be hard even to get this past filters, because if \\neverything else in the email is neutral, the spam probability will hinge on the url, and it will take \\nsome effort to make that look neutral.)\\nSpammers range from businesses running so-called opt-in lists who don\\'t even try to conceal \\ntheir identities, to guys who hijack mail servers to send out spams promoting porn sites. If we \\nuse filtering to whittle their options down to mails like the one above, that should pretty much \\nput the spammers on the \"legitimate', 'hijack mail servers to send out spams promoting porn sites. If we \\nuse filtering to whittle their options down to mails like the one above, that should pretty much \\nput the spammers on the \"legitimate\" end of the spectrum out of business; they feel obliged by \\nvarious state laws to include boilerplate about why their spam is not spam, and how to cancel \\nyour \"subscription,\" and that kind of text is easy to recognize.\\n(I used to think it was naive to believe that stricter laws would decrease spam. Now I think that \\nwhile stricter laws may not decrease the amount of spam that spammers send, they can \\ncertainly help filters to decrease the amount of spam that recipients actually see.)\\nAll along the spectrum, if you restrict the sales pitches spammers can make, you will inevitably \\ntend to put them out of business.

The cost is enormous for the recipients, about \\n5 man-weeks for each million recipients who spend a second to delete the spam, but the \\nspammer doesn't have to pay that.\\nSending spam does cost the spammer something, though. [2] So the lower we can get the \\nresponse rate-- whether by filtering, or by using filters to force spammers to dilute their pitches-- \\nthe fewer businesses will find it worth their while to send spam.\\nThe reason the spammers use the kinds of sales pitches that they do is to increase response \\nrates.

And \"thought you should check out the following\" is just not \\ngoing to have nearly the pull with the spam recipient as the kinds of things that spammers say \\nnow. Result: if it can\\'t contain exciting sales pitches, spam becomes less effective as a \\nmarketing vehicle, and fewer businesses want to use it.\\nThat is the big win in the end.

But I also think that the more different kinds of antispam efforts we \\nundertake, the better, because any measure that constrains spammers will tend to make \\nfiltering easier. And even within the world of content-based filtering, I think it will be a good thing \\nif there are many different kinds of software being used simultaneously.

For \\nexample, about 95% of current spam includes the url of a site they want you to visit. (The \\nremaining 5% want you to call a phone number, reply by email or to a US mail address, or in a \\nfew cases to buy a certain stock.)

The defining feature of spam (in fact, its raison d\\'etre) is not that it is unsolicited, but \\nthat it is automated.\\nIt is merely incidental, too, that spam is usually commercial. If someone started sending mass \\nemail to support some political cause, for example, it would be just as much spam as email \\npromoting a porn site.\\nI propose we define spam as unsolicited automated email.

Everyone knows who the pointy-\\nhaired boss is, right? I think most people in the technology world not only recognize this \\ncartoon character, but know the actual person in their company that he is modelled upon.\\nThe pointy-haired boss miraculously combines two qualities that are common by themselves, \\nbut rarely seen together: (a) he knows nothing whatsoever about technology, and (b) he has \\nvery strong opinions about it.\\nSuppose, for example, you need to write a piece of software.

I know it must be, because I read about it in \\nthe press all the time. Since it is a standard, I won't get in trouble for using it. And that also \\nmeans there will always be lots of Java programmers, so if the programmers working for me \\nnow quit, as programmers working for me mysteriously always do, I can easily replace them.\\nWell, this doesn't sound that unreasonable.

But it's all based on one unspoken assumption, and \\nthat assumption turns out to be false. The pointy-haired boss believes that all programming \\nlanguages are pretty much equivalent. If that were true, he would be right on target. If \\nlanguages are all equivalent, sure, use whatever language everyone else is using.\\nBut all languages are not equivalent, and I think I can prove this to you without even getting into \\nthe differences between them. If you asked the pointy-haired boss in 1992 what language \\nsoftware should be written in, he would have answered with as little hesitation as he does today. \\nSoftware should be written in C++. But if languages are all equivalent, why should the pointy-\\nhaired boss's opinion ever change? In fact, why should the developers of Java have even \\nbothered to create a new language?\\nPresumably, if you create a new language, it's because\", \"hy should the pointy-\\nhaired boss's opinion ever change? In fact, why should the developers of Java have even \\nbothered to create a new language?\\nPresumably, if you create a new language, it's because you think it's better in some way than \\nwhat people already had. And in fact, Gosling makes it clear in the first Java white paper that \\nJava was designed to fix some problems with C++. So there you have it: languages are not all \\nequivalent. If you follow the trail through the pointy-haired boss's brain to Java and then back \\nthrough Java's history to its origins, you end up holding an idea that contradicts the assumption \\nyou started with.\\nSo, who's right? James Gosling, or the pointy-haired boss? Not surprisingly, Gosling is right. \\nSome languages are better, for certain problems, than others. And you know, that raises some \\ninteresting questions.

Are there situations where other languages \\nare better than either of them?\\nOnce you start considering this question, you have opened a real can of worms. If the pointy-\\nhaired boss had to think about the problem in its full complexity, it would make his brain \\nexplode. As long as he considers all languages equivalent, all he has to do is choose the one \\nthat seems to have the most momentum, and since that is more a question of fashion than \\ntechnology, even he can probably get the right answer. But if languages vary, he suddenly has \\nto solve two simultaneous equations, trying to find an optimal balance between two things he \\nknows nothing about: the relative suitability of the twenty or so leading languages for the \\nproblem he needs to solve, and the odds of finding programmers, libraries, etc. for each.

If that's \\nwhat's on the other side of the door, it is no surprise that the pointy-haired boss doesn't want to \\nopen it.\\nThe disadvantage of believing that all programming languages are equivalent is that it's not \\ntrue. But the advantage is that it makes your life a lot simpler. And I think that's the main reason \\nthe idea is so widespread. It is a comfortable idea.\\nWe know that Java must be pretty good, because it is the cool, new programming language. Or \\nis it?

At \\nleast, you notice this pattern if you are a Lisp hacker. Each one is progressively more like Lisp. \\nPython copies even features that many Lisp hackers consider to be mistakes. You could \\ntranslate simple Lisp programs into Python line for line. It's 2002, and programming languages \\nhave almost caught up with 1958.\\nCatching Up with Math\\nWhat I mean is that Lisp was first discovered by John McCarthy in\", \" Lisp programs into Python line for line. It's 2002, and programming languages \\nhave almost caught up with 1958.\\nCatching Up with Math\\nWhat I mean is that Lisp was first discovered by John McCarthy in 1958, and popular \\nprogramming languages are only now catching up with the ideas he developed then.\\nNow, how could that be true? Isn't computer technology something that changes very rapidly? I \\nmean, in 1958, computers were refrigerator-sized behemoths with the processing power of a \\nwristwatch. How could any technology that old even be relevant, let alone superior to the latest \\ndevelopments?\\nI'll tell you how. It's because Lisp was not really designed to be a programming language, at \\nleast not in the sense we mean today. What we mean by a programming language is something \\nwe use to tell a computer what to do. McCarthy did eventually intend to develop a programming \\nlanguage in this sense, but the Lisp that we actually ended up with was based on something \\nseparate that he did as a th\", \"a computer what to do. McCarthy did eventually intend to develop a programming \\nlanguage in this sense, but the Lisp that we actually ended up with was based on something \\nseparate that he did as a theoretical exercise-- an effort to define a more convenient alternative \\nto the Turing Machine. As McCarthy said later, Another way to show that Lisp was neater than \\nTuring machines was to write a universal Lisp function and show that it is briefer and more \\ncomprehensible than the description of a universal Turing machine. This was the Lisp function \\neval..., which computes the value of a Lisp expression.... Writing eval required inventing a \\nnotation representing Lisp functions as Lisp data, and such a notation was devised for the \\npurposes of the paper with no thought that it would be used to express Lisp programs in \\npractice. What happened next was that, some time in late 1958, Steve Russell, one of \\nMcCarthy's grad students, looked at this definition of eval and realized that if he t\", \"to express Lisp programs in \\npractice. What happened next was that, some time in late 1958, Steve Russell, one of \\nMcCarthy's grad students, looked at this definition of eval and realized that if he translated it \\ninto machine language, the result would be a Lisp interpreter.\\nThis was a big surprise at the time. Here is what McCarthy said about it later in an interview: \\nSteve Russell said, look, why don't I program this eval..., and I said to him, ho, ho, you're \\nconfusing theory with practice, this eval is intended for reading, not for computing. But he went \\nahead and did it. That is, he compiled the eval in my paper into [IBM] 704 machine code, fixing \\nbugs, and then advertised this as a Lisp interpreter, which it certainly was. So at that point Lisp \\nhad essentially the form that it has today.... Suddenly, in a matter of weeks I think, McCarthy \\nfound his theoretical exercise transformed into an actual programming language-- and a more \\npowerful one than he had intended.\\nSo the sh\", \"as today.... Suddenly, in a matter of weeks I think, McCarthy \\nfound his theoretical exercise transformed into an actual programming language-- and a more \\npowerful one than he had intended.\\nSo the short explanation of why this 1950s language is not obsolete is that it was not \\ntechnology but math, and math doesn't get stale. The right thing to compare Lisp to is not \\n1950s hardware, but, say, the Quicksort algorithm, which was discovered in 1960 and is still the \\nfastest general-purpose sort.\\nThere is one other language still surviving from the 1950s, Fortran, and it represents the \\nopposite approach to language design. Lisp was a piece of theory that unexpectedly got turned \\ninto a programming language. Fortran was developed intentionally as a programming language, \\nbut what we would now consider a very low-level one.\\nFortran I, the language that was developed in 1956, was a very different animal from present-\\nday Fortran. Fortran I was pretty much assembly language with math. In som\", ' consider a very low-level one.\\nFortran I, the language that was developed in 1956, was a very different animal from present-\\nday Fortran. Fortran I was pretty much assembly language with math. In some ways it was less \\npowerful than more recent assembly languages; there were no subroutines, for example, only \\nbranches. Present-day Fortran is now arguably closer to Lisp than to Fortran I.\\nLisp and Fortran were the trunks of two separate evolutionary trees, one rooted in math and \\none rooted in machine architecture. These two trees have been converging ever since. Lisp \\nstarted out powerful, and over the next twenty years got fast. So-called mainstream languages \\nstarted out fast, and over the next forty years gradually got more powerful, until now the most \\nadvanced of them are fairly close to Lisp. Close, but they are still missing a few things....\\nWhat Made Lisp Different\\nWhen it was first developed, Lisp embodied nine new ideas. Some of these we now take for \\ngranted, others are onl', \"e to Lisp. Close, but they are still missing a few things....\\nWhat Made Lisp Different\\nWhen it was first developed, Lisp embodied nine new ideas. Some of these we now take for \\ngranted, others are only seen in more advanced languages, and two are still unique to Lisp. The \\nnine ideas are, in order of their adoption by the mainstream, Conditionals. A conditional is an if-\\nthen-else construct. We take these for granted now, but Fortran I didn't have them. It had only a \\nconditional goto closely based on the underlying machine instruction.\\n A function type. In Lisp, functions are a data type just like integers or strings. They have a literal \\nrepresentation, can be stored in variables, can be passed as arguments, and so on.\\n Recursion. Lisp was the first programming language to support it.\\n Dynamic typing. In Lisp, all variables are effectively pointers. Values are what have types, not \\nvariables, and assigning or binding variables means copying pointers, not what they point to.\\n Garbage-\", 'ynamic typing. In Lisp, all variables are effectively pointers. Values are what have types, not \\nvariables, and assigning or binding variables means copying pointers, not what they point to.\\n Garbage-collection.\\n Programs composed of expressions. Lisp programs are trees of expressions, each of which \\nreturns a value. This is in contrast to Fortran and most succeeding languages, which distinguish \\nbetween expressions and statements.\\nIt was natural to have this distinction in Fortran I because you could not nest statements. And \\nso while you needed expressions for math to work, there was no point in making anything else \\nreturn a value, because there could not be anything waiting for it.\\nThis limitation went away with the arrival of block-structured languages, but by then it was too \\nlate. The distinction between expressions and statements was entrenched. It spread from \\nFortran into Algol and then to both their descendants.\\n A symbol type. Symbols are effectively pointers to strings sto', \"he distinction between expressions and statements was entrenched. It spread from \\nFortran into Algol and then to both their descendants.\\n A symbol type. Symbols are effectively pointers to strings stored in a hash table. So you can \\ntest equality by comparing a pointer, instead of comparing each character.\\n A notation for code using trees of symbols and constants.\\n The whole language there all the time. There is no real distinction between read-time, compile-\\ntime, and runtime. You can compile or run code while reading, read or run code while compiling, \\nand read or compile code at runtime.\\nRunning code at read-time lets users reprogram Lisp's syntax; running code at compile-time is \\nthe basis of macros; compiling at runtime is the basis of Lisp's use as an extension language in \\nprograms like Emacs; and reading at runtime enables programs to communicate using s-\\nexpressions, an idea recently reinvented as XML. When Lisp first appeared, these ideas were \\nfar removed from ordinary progr\", \"like Emacs; and reading at runtime enables programs to communicate using s-\\nexpressions, an idea recently reinvented as XML. When Lisp first appeared, these ideas were \\nfar removed from ordinary programming practice, which was dictated largely by the hardware \\navailable in the late 1950s. Over time, the default language, embodied in a succession of \\npopular languages, has gradually evolved toward Lisp. Ideas 1-5 are now widespread. Number \\n6 is starting to appear in the mainstream. Python has a form of 7, though there doesn't seem to \\nbe any syntax for it.\\nAs for number 8, this may be the most interesting of the lot. Ideas 8 and 9 only became part of \\nLisp by accident, because Steve Russell implemented something McCarthy had never intended \\nto be implemented. And yet these ideas turn out to be responsible for both Lisp's strange \\nappearance and its most distinctive features. Lisp looks strange not so much because it has a \\nstrange syntax as because it has no syntax; you express program\", 'o be responsible for both Lisp\\'s strange \\nappearance and its most distinctive features. Lisp looks strange not so much because it has a \\nstrange syntax as because it has no syntax; you express programs directly in the parse trees \\nthat get built behind the scenes when other languages are parsed, and these trees are made of \\nlists, which are Lisp data structures.\\nExpressing the language in its own data structures turns out to be a very powerful feature. \\nIdeas 8 and 9 together mean that you can write programs that write programs. That may sound \\nlike a bizarre idea, but it\\'s an everyday thing in Lisp. The most common way to do it is with \\nsomething called a macro.\\nThe term \"macro\" does not mean in Lisp what it means in other languages. A Lisp macro can \\nbe anything from an abbreviation to a compiler for a new language. If you want to really \\nunderstand Lisp, or just expand your programming horizons, I would learn more about macros.\\nMacros (in the Lisp sense) are still, as far as I know,', ' compiler for a new language. If you want to really \\nunderstand Lisp, or just expand your programming horizons, I would learn more about macros.\\nMacros (in the Lisp sense) are still, as far as I know, unique to Lisp. This is partly because in \\norder to have macros you probably have to make your language look as strange as Lisp. It may \\nalso be because if you do add that final increment of power, you can no longer claim to have \\ninvented a new language, but only a new dialect of Lisp.\\nI mention this mostly as a joke, but it is quite true. If you define a language that has car, cdr, \\ncons, quote, cond, atom, eq, and a notation for functions expressed as lists, then you can build \\nall the rest of Lisp out of it. That is in fact the defining quality of Lisp: it was in order to make this \\nso that McCarthy gave Lisp the shape it has.\\nWhere Languages Matter\\nSo suppose Lisp does represent a kind of limit that mainstream languages are approaching \\nasymptotically-- does that mean you should actu', \"at McCarthy gave Lisp the shape it has.\\nWhere Languages Matter\\nSo suppose Lisp does represent a kind of limit that mainstream languages are approaching \\nasymptotically-- does that mean you should actually use it to write software? How much do you \\nlose by using a less powerful language? Isn't it wiser, sometimes, not to be at the very edge of \\ninnovation? And isn't popularity to some extent its own justification? Isn't the pointy-haired boss \\nright, for example, to want to use a language for which he can easily hire programmers?\\nThere are, of course, projects where the choice of programming language doesn't matter much. \\nAs a rule, the more demanding the application, the more leverage you get from using a \\npowerful language. But plenty of projects are not demanding at all. Most programming probably \\nconsists of writing little glue programs, and for little glue programs you can use any language \\nthat you're already familiar with and that has good libraries for whatever you need to do.

If you \\njust need to feed data from one Windows app to another, sure, use Visual Basic.\\nYou can write little glue programs in Lisp too (I use it as a desktop calculator), but the biggest \\nwin for languages like Lisp is at the other end of the spectrum, where you need to write \\nsophisticated programs to solve hard problems in the face of fierce competition. A good \\nexample is the airline fare search program that ITA Software licenses to Orbitz. These guys \\nentered a market already dominated by two big, entrenched competitors, Travelocity and \\nExpedia, and seem to have just humiliated them technologically.\\nThe core of ITA's application is a 200,000 line Common Lisp program that searches many \\norders of magnitude more possibilities than their competitors, who apparently are still using \\nmainfr\", \"logically.\\nThe core of ITA's application is a 200,000 line Common Lisp program that searches many \\norders of magnitude more possibilities than their competitors, who apparently are still using \\nmainframe-era programming techniques. (Though ITA is also in a sense using a mainframe-era \\nprogramming language.) I have never seen any of ITA's code, but according to one of their top \\nhackers they use a lot of macros, and I am not surprised to hear it.\\nCentripetal Forces\\nI'm not saying there is no cost to using uncommon technologies. The pointy-haired boss is not \\ncompletely mistaken to worry about this. But because he doesn't understand the risks, he tends \\nto magnify them.\\nI can think of three problems that could arise from using less common languages. Your \\nprograms might not work well with programs written in other languages. You might have fewer \\nlibraries at your disposal. And you might have trouble hiring programmers.\\nHow much of a problem is each of these? The importance of the first \", 'ograms written in other languages. You might have fewer \\nlibraries at your disposal. And you might have trouble hiring programmers.\\nHow much of a problem is each of these? The importance of the first varies depending on \\nwhether you have control over the whole system. If you\\'re writing software that has to run on a \\nremote user\\'s machine on top of a buggy, closed operating system (I mention no names), there \\nmay be advantages to writing your application in the same language as the OS. But if you \\ncontrol the whole system and have the source code of all the parts, as ITA presumably does, \\nyou can use whatever languages you want. If any incompatibility arises, you can fix it yourself.\\nIn server-based applications you can get away with using the most advanced technologies, and \\nI think this is the main cause of what Jonathan Erickson calls the \"programming language \\nrenaissance.\" This is why we even hear about new languages like Perl and Python. We\\'re not \\nhearing about these languages be', 's the main cause of what Jonathan Erickson calls the \"programming language \\nrenaissance.\" This is why we even hear about new languages like Perl and Python. We\\'re not \\nhearing about these languages because people are using them to write Windows apps, but \\nbecause people are using them on servers. And as software shifts off the desktop and onto \\nservers (a future even Microsoft seems resigned to), there will be less and less pressure to use \\nmiddle-of-the-road technologies.\\nAs for libraries, their importance also depends on the application. For less demanding \\nproblems, the availability of libraries can outweigh the intrinsic power of the language. Where is \\nthe breakeven point? Hard to say exactly, but wherever it is, it is short of anything you\\'d be likely \\nto call an application. If a company considers itself to be in the software business, and they\\'re \\nwriting an application that will be one of their products, then it will probably involve several \\nhackers and take at least six mont', \"mpany considers itself to be in the software business, and they're \\nwriting an application that will be one of their products, then it will probably involve several \\nhackers and take at least six months to write. In a project of that size, powerful languages \\nprobably start to outweigh the convenience of pre-existing libraries.\\nThe third worry of the pointy-haired boss, the difficulty of hiring programmers, I think is a red \\nherring. How many hackers do you need to hire, after all? Surely by now we all know that \\nsoftware is best developed by teams of less than ten people. And you shouldn't have trouble \\nhiring hackers on that scale for any language anyone has ever heard of. If you can't find ten \\nLisp hackers, then your company is probably based in the wrong city for developing software.\\nIn fact, choosing a more powerful language probably decreases the size of the team you need, \\nbecause (a) if you use a more powerful language you probably won't need as many hackers, \\nand (b) hackers \", 'In fact, choosing a more powerful language probably decreases the size of the team you need, \\nbecause (a) if you use a more powerful language you probably won\\'t need as many hackers, \\nand (b) hackers who work in more advanced languages are likely to be smarter.\\nI\\'m not saying that you won\\'t get a lot of pressure to use what are perceived as \"standard\" \\ntechnologies. At Viaweb (now Yahoo Store), we raised some eyebrows among VCs and \\npotential acquirers by using Lisp. But we also raised eyebrows by using generic Intel boxes as \\nservers instead of \"industrial strength\" servers like Suns, for using a then-obscure open-source \\nUnix variant called FreeBSD instead of a real commercial OS like Windows NT, for ignoring a \\nsupposed e-commerce standard called SET that no one now even remembers, and so on.\\nYou can\\'t let the suits make technical decisions for you.

What seemed like an anomaly to them was \\nin fact cause and effect.\\nIf you start a startup, don't design your product to please VCs or potential acquirers. Design \\nyour product to please the users. If you win the users, everything else will follow. And if you \\ndon't, no one will care how comfortingly orthodox your technology choices were.\\nThe Cost of Being Average\\nHow much do you lose by using a less powerful language? There is actually some data out \\nthere about that.\\nThe most convenient measure of power is probably code size. The point of high-level languages \\nis to give you bigger abstractions-- bigger bricks, as it were, so you don't need as many to build \\na wall of a given size.

So the more powerful the language, the shorter the program (not simply \\nin characters, of course, but in distinct elements).\\nHow does a more powerful language enable you to write shorter programs? One technique you \\ncan use, if the language will let you, is something called bottom-up programming. Instead of \\nsimply writing your application in the base language, you build on top of the base language a \\nlanguage for writing programs like yours, then write your program in it. The combined code can \\nbe much shorter than if you had written your whole program in the base language-- indeed, this \\nis how most compression algorithms work. A bottom-up program should be easier to modify as \\nwell, because in many cases the language layer won't have to change at all.\\nCode size is important, because the time it takes to write a program depends mostly on its \\nlen\", 'ould be easier to modify as \\nwell, because in many cases the language layer won\\'t have to change at all.\\nCode size is important, because the time it takes to write a program depends mostly on its \\nlength. If your program would be three times as long in another language, it will take three times \\nas long to write-- and you can\\'t get around this by hiring more people, because beyond a \\ncertain size new hires are actually a net lose. Fred Brooks described this phenomenon in his \\nfamous book The Mythical Man-Month, and everything I\\'ve seen has tended to confirm what he \\nsaid.\\nSo how much shorter are your programs if you write them in Lisp? Most of the numbers I\\'ve \\nheard for Lisp versus C, for example, have been around 7-10x. But a recent article about ITA in \\nNew Architect magazine said that \"one line of Lisp can replace 20 lines of C,\" and since this \\narticle was full of quotes from ITA\\'s president, I assume they got this number from ITA. If so \\nthen we can put some faith in it; ITA\\'s so', '\"one line of Lisp can replace 20 lines of C,\" and since this \\narticle was full of quotes from ITA\\'s president, I assume they got this number from ITA. If so \\nthen we can put some faith in it; ITA\\'s software includes a lot of C and C++ as well as Lisp, so \\nthey are speaking from experience.\\nMy guess is that these multiples aren\\'t even constant. I think they increase when you face \\nharder problems and also when you have smarter programmers. A really good hacker can \\nsqueeze more out of better tools.\\nAs one data point on the curve, at any rate, if you were to compete with ITA and chose to write \\nyour software in C, they would be able to develop software twenty times faster than you. If you \\nspent a year on a new feature, they\\'d be able to duplicate it in less than three weeks.

When you talk about code-size ratios, \\nyou\\'re impli', \"y spent just three months developing something new, it would be five years before you had \\nit too.\\nAnd you know what? That's the best-case scenario. When you talk about code-size ratios, \\nyou're implicitly assuming that you can actually write the program in the weaker language. But \\nin fact there are limits on what programmers can do. If you're trying to solve a hard problem with \\na language that's too low-level, you reach a point where there is just too much to keep in your \\nhead at once.\\nSo when I say it would take ITA's imaginary competitor five years to duplicate something ITA \\ncould write in Lisp in three months, I mean five years if nothing goes wrong. In fact, the way \\nthings work in most companies, any development project that would take five years is likely \\nnever to get finished at all.\\nI admit this is an extreme case.

And \\nso most of them don\\'t. Because, you know, when it comes down to it, the pointy-haired boss \\ndoesn\\'t mind if his company gets their ass kicked, so long as no one can prove it\\'s his fault. The \\nsafest plan for him personally is to stick close to the center of the herd.\\nWithin large organizations, the phrase used to describe this approach is \"industry best \\npractice.\" Its purpose is to shield the pointy-haired boss from responsibility: if he chooses \\nsomething that is \"industry best practice,\" and the company loses, he can\\'t be blamed. He didn\\'t \\nchoose, the industry did.\\nI believe this term was originally used to describe accounting ', ' he chooses \\nsomething that is \"industry best practice,\" and the company loses, he can\\'t be blamed. He didn\\'t \\nchoose, the industry did.\\nI believe this term was originally used to describe accounting methods and so on. What it \\nmeans, roughly, is don\\'t do anything weird. And in accounting that\\'s probably a good idea. The \\nterms \"cutting-edge\" and \"accounting\" do not sound good together. But when you import this \\ncriterion into decisions about technology, you start to get the wrong answers.\\nTechnology often should be cutting-edge. In programming languages, as Erann Gat has pointed \\nout, what \"industry best practice\" actually gets you is not the best, but merely the average. \\nWhen a decision causes you to develop software at a fraction of the rate of more aggressive \\ncompetitors, \"best practice\" is a misnomer.\\nSo here we have two pieces of information that I think are very valuable.

Number 1, languages vary in power. Number 2, most managers \\ndeliberately ignore this. Between them, these two facts are literally a recipe for making money. \\nITA is an example of this recipe in action. If you want to win in a software business, just take on \\nthe hardest problem you can find, use the most powerful language you can get, and wait for \\nyour competitors\\' pointy-haired bosses to revert to the mean.\\nAppendix: Power\\nAs an illustration of what I mean about the relative power of programming languages, consider \\nthe following problem. We want to write a function that generates accumulators-- a function that \\ntakes a number n, and returns a function that takes another number i and returns n \\nincremented by i.\\n(That\\'s incremented by, not plus. An accumulator has to accumulate.)\\nIn Common Lisp this would be (defun foo (n) (lambda (i) (incf n i))) ', \" that takes another number i and returns n \\nincremented by i.\\n(That's incremented by, not plus. An accumulator has to accumulate.)\\nIn Common Lisp this would be (defun foo (n) (lambda (i) (incf n i))) and in Perl 5, sub foo { my \\n($n) = @_; sub {$n += shift} } which has more elements than the Lisp version because you have \\nto extract parameters manually in Perl.\\nIn Smalltalk the code is slightly longer than in Lisp foo: n |s| s := n. ^[:i| s := s+i. ] because \\nalthough in general lexical variables work, you can't do an assignment to a parameter, so you \\nhave to create a new variable s.\\nIn Javascript the example is, again, slightly longer, because Javascript retains the distinction \\nbetween statements and expressions, so you need explicit return statements to return values: \\nfunction foo(n) { return function (i) { return n += i } } (To be fair, Perl also retains this distinction, \\nbut deals with it in typical Perl fashion by letting you omit returns.)\\nIf you try to translate the Lisp/Per\", \"{ return function (i) { return n += i } } (To be fair, Perl also retains this distinction, \\nbut deals with it in typical Perl fashion by letting you omit returns.)\\nIf you try to translate the Lisp/Perl/Smalltalk/Javascript code into Python you run into some \\nlimitations. Because Python doesn't fully support lexical variables, you have to create a data \\nstructure to hold the value of n. And although Python does have a function data type, there is \\nno literal representation for one (unless the body is only a single expression) so you need to \\ncreate a named function to return. This is what you end up with: def foo(n): s = [n] def bar(i): s[0] \\n+= i return s[0] return bar Python users might legitimately ask why they can't just write def \\nfoo(n): return lambda i: return n += i or even def foo(n): lambda i: n += i and my guess is that \\nthey probably will, one day. (But if they don't want to wait for Python to evolve the rest of the way \\ninto Lisp, they could always just...) \\nIn OO languages\", \"n): lambda i: n += i and my guess is that \\nthey probably will, one day. (But if they don't want to wait for Python to evolve the rest of the way \\ninto Lisp, they could always just...) \\nIn OO languages, you can, to a limited extent, simulate a closure (a function that refers to \\nvariables defined in enclosing scopes) by defining a class with one method and a field to \\nreplace each variable from an enclosing scope. This makes the programmer do the kind of code \\nanalysis that would be done by the compiler in a language with full support for lexical scope, \\nand it won't work if more than one function refers to the same variable, but it is enough in \\nsimple cases like this.\\nPython experts seem to agree that this is the preferred way to solve the problem in Python, \\nwriting either def foo(n): class acc: def __init__(self, s): self.s = s def inc(self, i): self.s += i return \\nself.s return acc(n).inc or class foo: def __init__(self, n): self.n = n def __call__(self, i): self.n += i \\nreturn sel\", \"ass acc: def __init__(self, s): self.s = s def inc(self, i): self.s += i return \\nself.s return acc(n).inc or class foo: def __init__(self, n): self.n = n def __call__(self, i): self.n += i \\nreturn self.n I include these because I wouldn't want Python advocates to say I was \\nmisrepresenting the language, but both seem to me more complex than the first version. You're \\ndoing the same thing, setting up a separate place to hold the accumulator; it's just a field in an \\nobject instead of the head of a list. And the use of these special, reserved field names, \\nespecially __call__, seems a bit of a hack.\\nIn the rivalry between Perl and Python, the claim of the Python hackers seems to be that that \\nPython is a more elegant alternative to Perl, but what this case shows is that power is the \\nultimate elegance: the Perl program is simpler (has fewer elements), even if the syntax is a bit \\nuglier.\\nHow about other languages? In the other languages mentioned in this talk-- Fortran, C, C++, \\nJava, an\", \"e elegance: the Perl program is simpler (has fewer elements), even if the syntax is a bit \\nuglier.\\nHow about other languages? In the other languages mentioned in this talk-- Fortran, C, C++, \\nJava, and Visual Basic-- it is not clear whether you can actually solve this problem. Ken \\nAnderson says that the following code is about as close as you can get in Java: public interface \\nInttoint { public int call(int i); } public static Inttoint foo(final int n) { return new Inttoint() { int s = n; \\npublic int call(int i) { s = s + i; return s; }}; } This falls short of the spec because it only works for \\nintegers. After many email exchanges with Java hackers, I would say that writing a properly \\npolymorphic version that behaves like the preceding examples is somewhere between damned \\nawkward and impossible.

If anyone wants to write one I'd be very curious to see it, but I \\npersonally have timed out.\\nIt's not literally true that you can't solve this problem in other languages, of course. The fact that \\nall these languages are Turing-equivalent means that, strictly speaking, you can write any \\nprogram in any of them. So how would you do it? In the limit case, by writing a Lisp interpreter \\nin the less powerful language.\\nThat sounds like a joke, but it happens so often to varying degrees in large programming \\nprojects that there is a name for the phenomenon, Greenspun's Tenth Rule: Any sufficiently \\ncomplicated C or Fortran program contains an ad hoc informally-specified bug-ridden slow \\nimplementation of half of Common Lisp. If you try to solve a hard problem, the question is not \\nwhether you will use a powerful enough language, but whether you will (a) use a powerful \\nlanguage, (b) write a de facto interpreter for one, or (c) yourself become a human compiler for \\none.

This seems to me an important question, maybe the most \\nimportant question for anyone interested in language design, and one that it would be useful to \\nconfront directly. I don't feel sure yet that the answer is a simple yes, but it seems a good \\nhypothesis to begin with.\\nHypothesis\\nMy hypothesis is that succinctness is power, or is close enough that except in pathological \\nexamples you can treat them as identical.\\nIt seems to me that succinctness is what programming languages are for.

Computers would be \\njust as happy to be told what to do directly in machine language. I think that the main reason we \\ntake the trouble to develop high-level languages is to get leverage, so that we can say (and \\nmore importantly, think) in 10 lines of a high-level language what would require 1000 lines of \\nmachine language. In other words, the main point of high-level languages is to make source \\ncode smaller.\\nIf smaller source code is the purpose of high-level languages, and the power of something is \\nhow well it achieves its purpose, then the measure of the power of a programming language is \\nhow small it makes your programs.\\nConversely, a language that doesn't make your programs small is doing a bad job of what \\nprogramming languages are supposed to do, like a knife that doesn't cut well, or printing that's \\nillegible. \\nMetrics\\nSmall in what sense though? The most \", \"r programs small is doing a bad job of what \\nprogramming languages are supposed to do, like a knife that doesn't cut well, or printing that's \\nillegible. \\nMetrics\\nSmall in what sense though? The most common measure of code size is lines of code. But I \\nthink that this metric is the most common because it is the easiest to measure. I don't think \\nanyone really believes it is the true test of the length of a program. Different languages have \\ndifferent conventions for how much you should put on a line; in C a lot of lines have nothing on \\nthem but a delimiter or two.\\nAnother easy test is the number of characters in a program, but this is not very good either; \\nsome languages (Perl, for example) just use shorter identifiers than others.\\nI think a better measure of the size of a program would be the number of elements, where an \\nelement is anything that would be a distinct node if you drew a tree representing the source \\ncode.

There are borderline cases (is -5 two \\nelements or one?) but I think most of them are the same for every language, so they don't affect \\ncomparisons much.\\nThis metric needs fleshing out, and it could require interpretation in the case of specific \\nlanguages, but I think it tries to measure the right thing, which is the number of parts a program \\nhas. I think the tree you'd draw in this exercise is what you have to make in your head in order \\nto conceive of the program, and so its size is proportionate to the amount of work you have to \\ndo to write or read it.\\nDesign\\nThis kind of metric would allow us to compare differen\", 'our head in order \\nto conceive of the program, and so its size is proportionate to the amount of work you have to \\ndo to write or read it.\\nDesign\\nThis kind of metric would allow us to compare different languages, but that is not, at least for \\nme, its main value. The main value of the succinctness test is as a guide in designing \\nlanguages. The most useful comparison between languages is between two potential variants \\nof the same language. What can I do in the language to make programs shorter?\\nIf the conceptual load of a program is proportionate to its complexity, and a given programmer \\ncan tolerate a fixed conceptual load, then this is the same as asking, what can I do to enable \\nprogrammers to get the most done? And that seems to me identical to asking, how can I design \\na good language?\\n(Incidentally, nothing makes it more patently obvious that the old chestnut \"all languages are \\nequivalent\" is false than designing languages.

If you can do something that \\nmakes many different programs shorter, it is probably not a coincidence: you have probably \\ndiscovered a useful new abstraction. You might even be able to write a program to help by \\nsearching source code for repeated patterns.

When I first read this in my early twenties, it was a big \\nsurprise to me and seemed to have huge implications. It meant that (a) the only way to get \\nsoftware written faster was to use a more succinct language, and (b) someone who took the \\ntrouble to do this could leave competitors who didn't in the dust.\\nBrooks' hypothesis, if it's true, seems to be at the very heart of hacking.

Studies like \\nLutz Prechelt's comparison of programming languages, while generating the kind of results I \\nexpected, tend to use problems that are too short to be meaningful tests.

And the only real test, if you \\nbelieve as I do that the main purpose of a language is to be good to think in (rather than just to \\ntell a computer what to do once you've thought of it) is what new things you can write in it. So \\nany language comparison where you have to meet a predefined spec is testing slightly the \\nwrong thing.\\nThe true test of a language is how well you can discover and solve new problems, not how well \\nyou can use it to solve a problem someone else has already formulated.

And \\nindeed, the way tapestries and mosaics are made in practice is to make a painting first, then \\ncopy it. (The word \"cartoon\" was originally used to describe a painting intended for this \\npurpose).\\nWhat this means is that we are never likely to have accurate comparisons of the relative power \\nof programming languages.

That becomes an end in itself, possibly more \\nimportant than programmer productivity, in applications like network switches.\\nThe Taste Test\\nUltimately, I think you have to go with your gut. What does it feel like to program in the \\nlanguage? I think the way to find (or design) the best language is to become hypersensitive to \\nhow well a language lets you think, then choose/design the language that feels best. If some \\nlanguage feature is awkward or restricting, don't worry, you'll know about it.\\nSuch hypersensitivity will come at a cost.

I know many Lisp hackers that this has happened to. In fact, the most \\naccurate measure of the relative power of programming languages might be the percentage of \\npeople who know the language who will take any job where they get to use that language, \\nregardless of the application domain.\\nRestrictiveness\\nI think most hackers know what it means for a language to feel restrictive. What's happening \\nwhen you feel that? I think it's the same feeling you get when the street you want to take is \\nblocked off, and you have to take a long detour to get where you wanted to go.

The problem is not simply that you can't say what you planned to. It's that the detour \\nthe language makes you take is longer. Try this thought experiment. Suppose there were some \\nprogram you wanted to write, and the language wouldn't let you express it the way you planned \\nto, but instead forced you to write the program in some other way that was shorter. For me at \\nleast, that wouldn't feel very restrictive. It would be like the street you wanted to take being \\nblocked off, and the policeman at the intersection directing you to a shortcut instead of a detour. \\nGreat!\\nI think most (ninety percent?) of the feeling of restricti\", \" street you wanted to take being \\nblocked off, and the policeman at the intersection directing you to a shortcut instead of a detour. \\nGreat!\\nI think most (ninety percent?) of the feeling of restrictiveness comes from being forced to make \\nthe program you write in the language longer than one you have in your head. Restrictiveness \\nis mostly lack of succinctness. So when a language feels restrictive, what that (mostly) means is \\nthat it isn't succinct enough, and when a language isn't succinct, it will feel restrictive.\\nReadability\\nThe quote I began with mentions two other qualities, regularity and readability. I'm not sure what \\nregularity is, or what advantage, if any, code that is regular and readable has over code that is \\nmerely readable. But I think I know what is meant by readability, and I think it is also related to \\nsuccinctness.\\nWe have to be careful here to distinguish between the readability of an individual line of code \\nand the readability of the whole program. It's the \", \"y, and I think it is also related to \\nsuccinctness.\\nWe have to be careful here to distinguish between the readability of an individual line of code \\nand the readability of the whole program. It's the second that matters. I agree that a line of \\nBasic is likely to be more readable than a line of Lisp. But a program written in Basic is is going \\nto have more lines than the same program written in Lisp (especially once you cross over into \\nGreenspunland). The total effort of reading the Basic program will surely be greater. total effort \\n= effort per line x number of lines I'm not as sure that readability is directly proportionate to \\nsuccinctness as I am that power is, but certainly succinctness is a factor (in the mathematical \\nsense; see equation above) in readability. So it may not even be meaningful to say that the goal \\nof a language is readability, not succinctness; it could be like saying the goal was readability, not \\nreadability.\\nWhat readability-per-line does mean, to the user \", \"e meaningful to say that the goal \\nof a language is readability, not succinctness; it could be like saying the goal was readability, not \\nreadability.\\nWhat readability-per-line does mean, to the user encountering the language for the first time, is \\nthat source code will look unthreatening. So readability-per-line could be a good marketing \\ndecision, even if it is a bad design decision. It's isomorphic to the very successful technique of \\nletting people pay in installments: instead of frightening them with a high upfront price, you tell \\nthem the low monthly payment. Installment plans are a net lose for the buyer, though, as mere \\nreadability-per-line probably is for the programmer. The buyer is going to make a lot of those \\nlow, low payments; and the programmer is going to read a lot of those individually readable \\nlines.\\nThis tradeoff predates programming languages.

And yet, I am pretty sure that the notation is not the problem, even \\nthough it may feel like it is. The math paper is hard to read because the ideas are hard. If you \\nexpressed the same ideas in prose (as mathematicians had to do before they evolved succinct \\nnotations), they wouldn't be any easier to read, because the paper would grow to the size of a \\nbook.\\nTo What Extent?\\nA number of people have rejected the idea that succinctness = power. I think it would be more \\nuseful, instead of simply arguing that they are the same or aren't, to ask: to what extent does \\nsuccinctness = power?

I really want to know the answer. \\nWhen, if ever, is a language too succinct for its own good?\\nThe hypothesis I began with was that, except in pathological examples, I thought succinctness \\ncould be considered identical with power. What I meant was that in any language anyone would \\ndesign, they would be identical, but that if someone wanted to design a language explicitly to \\ndisprove this hyphothesis, they could probably do it.

But if you come out of the closet and admit, at least to yourself, that there \\nis such a thing as good and bad design, then you can start to study good design in detail. How \\nhas your taste changed? When you made mistakes, what caused you to make them? What \\nhave other people learned about design?\\nOnce you start to examine the question, it's surprising how much different fields' ideas of \\nbeauty have in common. The same principles of good design crop up again and again.\\nGood design is simple. You hear this from math to painting. In math it means that a shorter \\nproof tends to be a better one. Where axioms are concerned, especially, less is more. It means \\nmuch the same thing in programming. For architects and designers it means that beauty should \\ndepend on a few carefully chosen structural elements rather than a profusion of superficial \\nornament.

(Ornament is not in itself bad, only when it\\'s camouflage on insipid form.) Similarly, in \\npainting, a still life of a few carefully observed and solidly modelled objects will tend to be more \\ninteresting than a stretch of flashy but mindlessly repetitive painting of, say, a lace collar. In \\nwriting it means: say what you mean and say it briefly.\\nIt seems strange to have to emphasize simplicity. You\\'d think simple would be the default. \\nOrnate is more work. But something seems to come over people when they try to be creative. \\nBeginning writers adopt a pompous tone that doesn\\'t sound anything like the way they speak. \\nDesigners trying to be artistic resort to swooshes and curlicues. Painters discover that they\\'re \\nexpressionists. It\\'s all evasion. Underneath the long words or the \"expressive\" brush strokes, \\nthere is not much going on, and that\\'s fright', 'to swooshes and curlicues. Painters discover that they\\'re \\nexpressionists. It\\'s all evasion. Underneath the long words or the \"expressive\" brush strokes, \\nthere is not much going on, and that\\'s frightening.\\nWhen you\\'re forced to be simple, you\\'re forced to face the real problem. When you can\\'t deliver \\nornament, you have to deliver substance.\\nGood design is timeless. In math, every proof is timeless unless it contains a mistake. So what \\ndoes Hardy mean when he says there is no permanent place for ugly mathematics? He means \\nthe same thing Kelly Johnson did: if something is ugly, it can\\'t be the best solution. There must \\nbe a better one, and eventually someone will discover it.\\nAiming at timelessness is a way to make yourself find the best answer: if you can imagine \\nsomeone surpassing you, you should do it yourself.

Some of the greatest masters did this so \\nwell that they left little room for those who came after. Every engraver since Durer has had to \\nlive in his shadow.\\nAiming at timelessness is also a way to evade the grip of fashion. Fashions almost by definition \\nchange with time, so if you can make something that will still look good far into the future, then \\nits appeal must derive more from merit and less from fashion.\\nStrangely enough, if you want to make something that will appeal to future generations, one \\nway to do it is to try to appeal to past generations. It's hard to guess what the future will be like, \\nbut we can be sure it will be like the past in caring nothing for present fashions. So if you can \\nmake something that appeals to people today and would also have appealed to people in 1500, \\nthere is a good chance it will appeal to people in 2500.\\nGood design solves the right problem.

The typical stove has four burners arranged in a square, \\nand a dial to control each. How do you arrange the dials? The simplest answer is to put them in \\na row. But this is a simple answer to the wrong question. The dials are for humans to use, and if \\nyou put them in a row, the unlucky human will have to stop and think each time about which dial \\nmatches which burner. Better to arrange the dials in a square like the burners.\\nA lot of bad design is industrious, but misguided. In the mid twentieth century there was a \\nvogue for setting text in sans-serif fonts. These fonts are closer to the pure, underlying \\nletterforms. But in text that's not the problem you're trying to solve. For legibility it's more \\nimportant that letters be easy to tell apart.

In software, an intractable problem can usually \\nbe replaced by an equivalent one that's easy to solve. Physics progressed faster as the problem \\nbecame predicting observable behavior, instead of reconciling it with scripture.\\nGood design is suggestive. Jane Austen's novels contain almost no description; instead of \\ntelling you how everything looks, she tells her story so well that you envision the scene for \\nyourself. Likewise, a painting that suggests is usually more engaging than one that tells. \\nEveryone makes up their own story about the Mona Lisa.\\nIn architecture and design, this principle means that a building or object should let you use it \\nhow you want: a good building, for example, will serve as a backdrop for whatever life people \\nwant to lead in i\", \"cture and design, this principle means that a building or object should let you use it \\nhow you want: a good building, for example, will serve as a backdrop for whatever life people \\nwant to lead in it, instead of making them live as if they were executing a program written by the \\narchitect.\\nIn software, it means you should give users a few basic elements that they can combine as they \\nwish, like Lego. In math it means a proof that becomes the basis for a lot of new work is \\npreferable to a proof that was difficult, but doesn't lead to future discoveries; in the sciences \\ngenerally, citation is considered a rough indicator of merit.\\nGood design is often slightly funny. This one may not always be true. But Durer's engravings \\nand Saarinen's womb chair and the Pantheon and the original Porsche 911 all seem to me \\nslightly funny.

The confident will often, like swallows, seem to be making fun of the \\nwhole process slightly, as Hitchcock does in his films or Bruegel in his paintings-- or \\nShakespeare, for that matter.\\nGood design may not have to be funny, but it's hard to imagine something that could be called \\nhumorless also being good design.\\nGood design is hard. If you look at the people who've done great work, one thing they all seem \\nto have in common is that they worked very hard.

Ditto in engineering.\\nWhen you have to climb a mountain you toss everything unnecessary out of your pack. And so \\nan architect who has to build on a difficult site, or a small budget, will find that he is forced to \\nproduce an elegant design. Fashions and flourishes get knocked aside by the difficult business \\nof solving the problem at all.\\nNot every kind of hard is good. There is good pain and bad pain.

I think symmetry may just be one way to achieve simplicity, but it\\'s \\nimportant enough to be mentioned on its own. Nature uses it a lot, which is a good sign.\\nThere are two kinds of symmetry, repetition and recursion. Recursion means repetition in \\nsubelements, like the pattern of veins in a leaf.\\nSymmetry is unfashionable in some fields now, in reaction to excesses in the past. Architects \\nstarted consciously making buildings asymmetric in Victorian times and by the 1920s \\nasymmetry was an explicit premise of modernist architecture. Even these buildings only tended \\nto be asymmetric about major axes, though; there were hundreds of minor symmetries.\\nIn writing you find symmetry at every level, from the phrases in a sentence to the plo', \" these buildings only tended \\nto be asymmetric about major axes, though; there were hundreds of minor symmetries.\\nIn writing you find symmetry at every level, from the phrases in a sentence to the plot of a novel. \\nYou find the same in music and art. Mosaics (and some Cezannes) get extra visual punch by \\nmaking the whole picture out of the same atoms. Compositional symmetry yields some of the \\nmost memorable paintings, especially when two halves react to one another, as in the Creation \\nof Adam or American Gothic.\\nIn math and engineering, recursion, especially, is a big win. Inductive proofs are wonderfully \\nshort. In software, a problem that can be solved by recursion is nearly always best solved that \\nway. The Eiffel Tower looks striking partly because it is a recursive solution, a tower on a tower.\\nThe danger of symmetry, and repetition especially, is that it can be used as a substitute for \\nthought.\\nGood design resembles nature.

Working from life is a \\nvaluable tool in painting too, though its role has often been misunderstood. The aim is not \\nsimply to make a record. The point of painting from life is that it gives your mind something to \\nchew on: when your eyes are looking at something, your hand will do more interesting work.\\nImitating nature also works in engineering. Boats have long had spines and ribs like an animal's \\nribcage.

Genetic algorithms may let us create things too complex to design in the ordinary sense.\\nGood design is redesign. It's rare to get things right the first time. Experts expect to throw away \\nsome early work. They plan for plans to change.\\nIt takes confidence to throw work away. You have to be able to think, there's more where that \\ncame from.

Instead they convince themselves that the drawing is not that bad, really-- in \\nfact, maybe they meant it to look that way.\\nDangerous territory, that; if anything you should cultivate dissatisfaction. In Leonardo's drawings \\nthere are often five or six attempts to get a line right. The distinctive back of the Porsche 911 \\nonly appeared in the redesign of an awkward prototype. In Wright's early plans for the \\nGuggenheim, the right half was a ziggurat; he inverted it to get the present shape.\\nMistakes are natural.

Open-source software has fewer bugs because it admits the \\npossibility of bugs.\\nIt helps to have a medium that makes change easy. When oil paint replaced tempera in the \\nfifteenth century, it helped painters to deal with difficult subjects like the human figure because, \\nunlike tempera, oil can be blended and overpainted.\\nGood design can copy. Attitudes to copying often make a round trip. A novice imitates without \\nknowing it; next he tries consciously to be original; finally, he decides it's more important to be \\nright than original.\\nUnknowing imitation is almost a recipe for bad design.

It was \\nthis, more than Raphael's own work, that bothered the Pre-Raphaelites.\\nThe ambitious are not content to imitate. The second phase in the growth of taste is a \\nconscious attempt at originality.\\nI think the greatest masters go on to achieve a kind of selflessness. They just want to get the \\nright answer, and if part of the right answer has already been discovered by someone else, \\nthat's no reason not to use it. They're confident enough to take from anyone without feeling that \\ntheir own vision will be lost in the process.\\nGood design is often strange.

May 2002) (This article came about in response \\nto some questions on the LL1 mailing list. It is now incorporated in \\nRevenge of the Nerds.)\\nWhen McCarthy designed Lisp in the late 1950s, it was a radical departure from existing \\nlanguages, the most important of which was Fortran.\\nLisp embodied nine new ideas:\\n 1. Conditionals. A conditional is an if-then-else construct. We take these for granted now. They \\nwere invented by McCarthy in the course of developing Lisp.

McCarthy, \\nwho was on the Algol committee, got conditionals into Algol, whence they spread to most other \\nlanguages.\\n2. A function type. In Lisp, functions are first class objects-- they're a data type just like integers, \\nstrings, etc, and have a literal representation, can be stored in variables, can be passed as \\narguments, and so on.\\n3. Recursion. Recursion existed as a mathematical concept before Lisp of course, but Lisp was \\nthe first programming language to support it. (It's arguably implicit in making functions first class \\nobjects.)\\n4. A new concept of variables. In Lisp, all variables are effectively pointers.

In Lisp, all variables are effectively pointers. Values are what \\nhave types, not variables, and assigning or binding variables means copying pointers, not what \\nthey point to.\\n5. Garbage-collection.\\n6. Programs composed of expressions. Lisp programs are trees of expressions, each of which \\nreturns a value. (In some Lisps expressions can return multiple values.) This is in contrast to \\nFortran and most succeeding languages, which distinguish between expressions and \\nstatements.\\nIt was natural to have this distinction in Fortran because (not surprisingly in a language where \\nthe input format was punched cards) the language was line-oriented. You could not nest \\nstatements. And so while you needed expressions for math to work, there was no point in \\nmaking anything else return a value, because there could not be anything waiting for it.\\nThis limitation went away with the arrival of block-structured languages, but by then it was too \\nlate. The distinction betw', \"ng else return a value, because there could not be anything waiting for it.\\nThis limitation went away with the arrival of block-structured languages, but by then it was too \\nlate. The distinction between expressions and statements was entrenched.

Programs paged us, sent \\nfaxes and email to users, conducted transactions with credit card processors, and talked to one \\nanother through sockets, pipes, http requests, ssh, udp packets, shared memory, and files. \\nSome of Viaweb even consisted of the absence of programs, since one of the keys to Unix \\nsecurity is not to run unnecessary utilities that people might use to break into your servers.\\nIt did not end with softw', \"iaweb even consisted of the absence of programs, since one of the keys to Unix \\nsecurity is not to run unnecessary utilities that people might use to break into your servers.\\nIt did not end with software.

When you\\'re writing \\ndesktop software, you\\'re practically forced to write the application in the same language as the \\nunderlying operating system-- meaning C and C++.

Some \\ntime before the release date you assemble a new version in which half the code has been torn \\nout and replaced, introducing countless bugs.

Within a minute of hearing about a bug from a \\ncustomer, the support people could be standing next to a programmer hearing him say \"Shit, \\nyou\\'re right, it\\'s a bug.\" It delighted the support people to hear that \"you\\'re right\" from the \\nhackers. They used to bring us bugs with the same expectant air as a cat bringing you a mouse \\nit has just killed.

In addition to catching bugs, they were the keepers of the knowledge \\nof vaguer, buglike things, like features that confused users. [6] They were also a kind of proxy \\nfocus group; we could ask them which of two new features users wanted more, and they were \\nalways right.\\nMorale\\nBeing able to release software immediately is a big motivator.

The thing about ideas, though, is that they lead to more ideas. Have you ever \\nnoticed that when you sit down to write something, half the ideas that end up in it are ones you \\nthought of while writing it? The same thing happens with software. Working to implement one \\nidea gives you more ideas. So shelving an idea costs you not only that delay in implementing it, \\nbut also all the ideas that implementing it would have led to. In fact, shelving an idea probably \\neven inhibits new ideas: as you start to think of some new feature, you catch sight of the shelf \\nand think \"but I already have a lot of new things I want to do for the next release.\"\\nWhat big companies do instead of implem', ': as you start to think of some new feature, you catch sight of the shelf \\nand think \"but I already have a lot of new things I want to do for the next release.\"\\nWhat big companies do instead of implementing features is plan them.

We had \\ngeneral ideas about things we wanted to improve, but if we knew how we would have done it \\nalready. What were we going to do in the next six months? Whatever looked like the biggest \\nwin. I don\\'t know if I ever dared give this answer, but that was the truth. Plans are just another \\nword for ideas on the shelf.

I once worked for a medium-\\nsized desktop software company that had over 100 people working in engineering as a whole. \\nOnly 13 of these were in product development. All the rest were working on releases, ports, and \\nso on. With Web-based software, all you need (at most) are the 13 people, because there are \\nno releases, ports, and so on.\\nViaweb was written by just three people.

The number of possible connections between developers grows exponentially with the \\nsize of the group. The larger the group, the more time they'll spend in meetings negotiating how \\ntheir software will work together, and the more bugs they'll get from unforeseen interactions. \\nFortunately, this process also works in reverse: as groups get smaller, software development \\ngets exponentially more efficient.

When you\\'re hosting software, someone has to be watching the servers, \\nand in practice the only people who can do this properly are the ones who wrote the software. \\nAt Viaweb our system had so many components and changed so frequently that there was no \\ndefinite border between software and infrastructure. Arbitrarily declaring such a border would \\nhave constrained our design choices. And so although we were constantly hoping that one day \\n(\"in a couple months\") everything would be stable enough that we could hire someone whose \\njob was just to worry about the servers, it never happened.\\nI don\\'t think it could be any other way, as long as you\\'re still actively developing the product. \\nWeb-based software is never going to be something you', \" to worry about the servers, it never happened.\\nI don't think it could be any other way, as long as you're still actively developing the product. \\nWeb-based software is never going to be something you write, check in, and go home.

If a bug in your code corrupts some data on disk, you have to fix it. And so \\non. We found that you don't have to watch the servers every minute (after the first year or so), \\nbut you definitely want to keep an eye on things you've changed recently. You don't release \\ncode late at night and then go home.\\nWatching Users\\nWith server-based software, you're in closer touch with your code. You can also be in closer \\ntouch with your users.

But you can't have any idea what users will be \\nthinking, believe me, until you watch them. And server-based software gives you unprecedented \\ninformation about their behavior. You're not limited to small, artificial focus groups. You can see \\nevery click made by every user. You have to consider carefully what you're going to look at, \\nbecause you don't want to violate users' privacy, but even the most general statistical sampling \\ncan be very useful.\\nWhen you have the users on your server, you don't have to rely on benchmarks, for example. \\nBenchmarks are simulated users.

The \\nnumber of users you can support per server is the divisor of your capital cost, so if you can \\nmake your software very efficient you can undersell competitors and still make a profit. At \\nViaweb we got the capital cost per user down to about $5. It would be less now, probably less \\nthan the cost of sending them the first month's bill.

Viaweb had a scripting \\nlanguage called RTML that let advanced users define their own page styles. We found that \\nRTML became a kind of suggestion box, because users only used it when the predefined page \\nstyles couldn't do what they wanted. Originally the editor put button bars across the page, for \\nexample, but after a number of users used RTML to put buttons down the left side, we made \\nthat an option (in fact the default) in the predefined page styles.\\nFinally, by watching users you can often tell when they're in trouble.

I think it will be the same for most \\nWeb-based applications. If users can get through a test drive successfully, they'll like the \\nproduct. If they get confused or bored, they won't. So anything we could do to get more people \\nthrough the test drive would increase our growth rate.\\nI studied click trails of people taking the test drive and found that at a certain step they would \\nget confused and click on the browser's Back button.

At Viaweb they were initially individuals and smaller companies, \\nand I think this will be the rule with Web-based applications. These are the users who are ready \\nto try new things, partly because they're more flexible, and partly because they want the lower \\ncosts of new technology.\\nWeb-based applications will often be the best thing for big companies too (though they'll be \\nslow to realize it).

Some larger merchants were reluctant to use Viaweb \\nbecause they thought customers' credit card information would be safer on their own servers. It \\nwas not easy to make this point diplomatically, but in fact the data was almost certainly safer in \\nour hands than theirs. Who can hire better people to manage security, a technology startup \\nwhose whole business is running servers, or a clothing retailer?

Lots of small \\ncompanies flourished, and did it by making cool things.\\nStartups but More So\\nThe classic startup is fast and informal, with few people and little money. Those few people \\nwork very hard, and technology magnifies the effect of the decisions they make. If they win, \\nthey win big.\\nIn a startup writing Web-based applications, everything you associate with startups is taken to \\nan extreme.

In 1960, software \\ndevelopment meant a roomful of men with horn rimmed glasses and narrow black neckties, \\nindustriously writing ten lines of code a day on IBM coding forms. In 1980, it was a team of eight \\nto ten people wearing jeans to the office and typing into vt100s. Now it's a couple of guys sitting \\nin a living room with laptops.

The alarming thing about Web-based software is \\nthat there is nothing to prevent this becoming the default. The stories about sleeping under \\ndesks usually end: then at last we shipped it and we all went home and slept for a week. Web-\\nbased software never ships. You can work 16-hour days for as long as you want to. And \\nbecause you can, and your competitors can, you tend to be forced to. You can, so you must. It's \\nParkinson's Law running in reverse.\\nThe worst thing is not the hours but the responsibility. Programmers and system administrators \\ntraditionally each have their own separate worries.

With Web-based applications, \\nthese two kinds of stress get combined. The programmers become system administrators, but \\nwithout the sharply defined limits that ordinarily make the job bearable.\\nAt Viaweb we spent the first six months just writing software.

Web-based software forces \\nprogrammers to. There is less stress in total, but more for the programmers. That's not \\nnecessarily bad news. If you're a startup competing with a big company, it's good news. [15] \\nWeb-based applications offer a straightforward way to outwork your competitors.

The reason we have high level \\nlanguages is because people can't deal with machine language. The point of programming \\nlanguages is to prevent our poor frail human brains from being overwhelmed by a mass of \\ndetail.\\nArchitects know that some kinds of design problems are more personal than others.

Whereas designing programming languages is \\nlike designing chairs: it's all about dealing with human weaknesses.\\nMost of us hate to acknowledge this. Designing systems of great mathematical elegance \\nsounds a lot more appealing to most of us than pandering to human weaknesses. And there is \\na role for mathematical elegance: some kinds of elegance make programs easier to \\nunderstand. But elegance is not an end in itself.\\nAnd when I say languages have to be designed to suit human weaknesses, I don't mean that \\nlanguages have to be designed for bad programmers.

That may be so. But those few good programmers write \\na disproportionately large percentage of the software.\\nI'm interested in the question, how do you design a language that the very best hackers will \\nlike?

It had the same appeal as open-source software.\\n4. Aim for Brevity.\\nBrevity is underestimated and even scorned. But if you look into the hearts of hackers, you'll \\nsee that they really love it.

What Do You Need for Server-Based \\nSoftware? I think a lot of the most exciting new applications that get written in the next twenty \\nyears will be Web-based applications, meaning programs that sit on the server and talk to you \\nthrough a Web browser. And to write these kinds of programs we may need some new things.\\nOne thing we'll need is support for the new way that server-based apps get released. Instead of \\nhaving one or two big releases a year, like desktop software, server-based apps get released \\nas a series of small changes. You may have as many as five or ten releases a day. And as a \\nrule everyone will always use the latest version.\\nYou know how you can design programs to be debuggable? Well, server-based software \\nlikewise h\", \"y have as many as five or ten releases a day. And as a \\nrule everyone will always use the latest version.\\nYou know how you can design programs to be debuggable? Well, server-based software \\nlikewise has to be designed to be changeable. You have to be able to change it easily, or at \\nleast to know what is a small change and what is a momentous one.\\nAnother thing that might turn out to be useful for server based software, surprisingly, is \\ncontinuations. In Web-based software you can use something like continuation-passing style to \\nget the effect of subroutines in the inherently stateless world of a Web session. Maybe it would \\nbe worthwhile having actual continuations, if it was not too expensive.\\n4. What New Abstractions Are Left to Discover?\\nI'm not sure how reasonable a hope this is, but one thing I would really love to do, personally, is \\ndiscover a new abstraction-- something that would make as much of a difference as having first \\nclass functions or recursion or even keyword para\", \"t one thing I would really love to do, personally, is \\ndiscover a new abstraction-- something that would make as much of a difference as having first \\nclass functions or recursion or even keyword parameters. This may be an impossible dream. \\nThese things don't get discovered that often. But I am always looking.\\n1. You Can Use Whatever Language You Want.\\nWriting application programs used to mean writing desktop software. And in desktop software \\nthere is a big bias toward writing the application in the same language as the operating system. \\nAnd so ten years ago, writing software pretty much meant writing software in C. Eventually a \\ntradition evolved: application programs must not be written in unusual languages. And this \\ntradition had so long to develop that nontechnical people like managers and venture capitalists \\nalso learned it.\\nServer-based software blows away this whole model. With server-based software you can use \\nany language you want. Almost nobody understands this yet (esp\", \"gers and venture capitalists \\nalso learned it.\\nServer-based software blows away this whole model. With server-based software you can use \\nany language you want. Almost nobody understands this yet (especially not managers and \\nventure capitalists). A few hackers understand it, and that's why we even hear about new, indy \\nlanguages like Perl and Python. We're not hearing about Perl and Python because people are \\nusing them to write Windows apps.\\nWhat this means for us, as people interested in designing programming languages, is that there \\nis now potentially an actual audience for our work.\\n2. Speed Comes from Profilers.\\nLanguage designers, or at least language implementors, like to write compilers that generate \\nfast code. But I don't think this is what makes languages fast for users. Knuth pointed out long \\nago that speed only matters in a few critical bottlenecks. And anyone who's tried it knows that \\nyou can't guess where these bottlenecks are. Profilers are the answer.\\nLanguage desi\", \" pointed out long \\nago that speed only matters in a few critical bottlenecks. And anyone who's tried it knows that \\nyou can't guess where these bottlenecks are. Profilers are the answer.\\nLanguage designers are solving the wrong problem. Users don't need benchmarks to run fast. \\nWhat they need is a language that can show them what parts of their own programs need to be \\nrewritten. That's where speed comes from in practice. So maybe it would be a net win if \\nlanguage implementors took half the time they would have spent doing compiler optimizations \\nand spent it writing a good profiler instead.\\n3. You Need an Application to Drive the Design of a Language.\\nThis may not be an absolute rule, but it seems like the best languages all evolved together with \\nsome application they were being used to write. C was written by people who needed it for \\nsystems programming. Lisp was developed partly to do symbolic differentiation, and McCarthy \\nwas so eager to get started that he was writing differen\", \" write. C was written by people who needed it for \\nsystems programming.

That will tend to drive your \\nlanguage to have new features that programmers need. I personally am interested in writing a \\nlanguage that will be good for writing server-based applications.\\n[During the panel, Guy Steele also made this point, with the additional suggestion that the \\napplication should not consist of writing the compiler for your language, unless your language \\nhappens to be intended for writing compilers.]\\n4. A Language Has to Be Good for Writing Throwaway Programs.\\nYou know what a throwaway program is: something you write quickly for some limited task.

I \\nthink if you looked around you'd find that a lot of big, serious programs started as throwaway \\nprograms. I would not be surprised if most programs started as throwaway programs. And so if \\nyou want to make a language that's good for writing software in general, it has to be good for \\nwriting throwaway programs, because that is the larval stage of most software.\\n5. Syntax Is Connected to Semantics.\\nIt's traditional to think of syntax and semantics as being completely separate. This will sound \\nshocking, but it may be that they aren't. I think that what you want in your language may be \\nrelated to how you express it.\\nI was talking recently to Robert Morris, and he pointed out that operator overloading is a bigger \\nwin in languages with infix syntax. In a language with prefix syntax, any function you define is \\neffectively an operator. If you want to define a plus for a new type of nu\", \"or overloading is a bigger \\nwin in languages with infix syntax.

If you want to define a plus for a new type of number you've made up, \\nyou can just define a new function to add them. If you do that in a language with infix syntax, \\nthere's a big difference in appearance between the use of an overloaded operator and a \\nfunction call.\\n1. New Programming Languages.\\nBack in the 1970s it was fashionable to design new programming languages. Recently it hasn't \\nbeen. But I think server-based software will make new languages fashionable again. With \\nserver-based software, you can use any language you want, so if someone does design a \\nlanguage that actually seems better than others that are available, there will be people who \\ntake a risk and use it.\\n2. Time-Sharing.\\nRichard Kelsey gave this as an idea whose time has come again in the last panel, and I \\ncompletely agree with him.

Time-Sharing.\\nRichard Kelsey gave this as an idea whose time has come again in the last panel, and I \\ncompletely agree with him. My guess (and Microsoft's guess, it seems) is that much computing \\nwill move from the desktop onto remote servers. In other words, time-sharing is back. And I \\nthink there will need to be support for it at the language level. For example, I know that Richard \\nand Jonathan Rees have done a lot of work implementing process scheduling within Scheme \\n48.\\n3. Efficiency.\\nRecently it was starting to seem that computers were finally fast enough. More and more we \\nwere starting to hear about byte code, which implies to me at least that we feel we have cycles \\nto spare. But I don't think we will, with server-based software. Someone is going to have to pay \\nfor the servers that the software runs on, and the number of users they can support per \\nmachine will be the divisor of their capital cost.\\nSo I think efficiency will matter\", \"e is going to have to pay \\nfor the servers that the software runs on, and the number of users they can support per \\nmachine will be the divisor of their capital cost.\\nSo I think efficiency will matter, at least in computational bottlenecks. It will be especially \\nimportant to do i/o fast, because server-based applications do a lot of i/o.\\nIt may turn out that byte code is not a win, in the end. Sun and Microsoft seem to be facing off \\nin a kind of a battle of the byte codes at the moment. But they're doing it because byte code is a \\nconvenient place to insert themselves into the process, not because byte code is in itself a \\ngood idea. It may turn out that this whole battleground gets bypassed. That would be kind of \\namusing.\\n1. Clients.\\nThis is just a guess, but my guess is that the winning model for most applications will be purely \\nserver-based. Designing software that works on the assumption that everyone will have your \\nclient is like designing a society on the assumption that eve\", \"ng model for most applications will be purely \\nserver-based. Designing software that works on the assumption that everyone will have your \\nclient is like designing a society on the assumption that everyone will just be honest. It would \\ncertainly be convenient, but you have to assume it will never happen.\\nI think there will be a proliferation of devices that have some kind of Web access, and all you'll \\nbe able to assume about them is that they can support simple html and forms. Will you have a \\nbrowser on your cell phone? Will there be a phone in your palm pilot? Will your blackberry get a \\nbigger screen? Will you be able to browse the Web on your gameboy? Your watch? I don't \\nknow. And I don't have to know if I bet on everything just being on the server. It's just so much \\nmore robust to have all the brains on the server.\\n2. Object-Oriented Programming.\\nI realize this is a controversial one, but I don't think object-oriented programming is such a big \\ndeal. I think it is a fine model\", \" have all the brains on the server.\\n2. Object-Oriented Programming.\\nI realize this is a controversial one, but I don't think object-oriented programming is such a big \\ndeal. I think it is a fine model for certain kinds of applications that need that specific kind of data \\nstructure, like window systems, simulations, and cad programs. But I don't see why it ought to \\nbe the model for all programming.\\nI think part of the reason people in big companies like object-oriented programming is because \\nit yields a lot of what looks like work. Something that might naturally be represented as, say, a \\nlist of integers, can now be represented as a class with all kinds of scaffolding and hustle and \\nbustle.\\nAnother attraction of object-oriented programming is that methods give you some of the effect \\nof first class functions. But this is old news to Lisp programmers. When you have actual first \\nclass functions, you can just use them in whatever way is appropriate to the task at hand, \\ninstead of fo\", \"f first class functions. But this is old news to Lisp programmers. When you have actual first \\nclass functions, you can just use them in whatever way is appropriate to the task at hand, \\ninstead of forcing everything into a mold of classes and methods.\\nWhat this means for language design, I think, is that you shouldn't build object-oriented \\nprogramming in too deeply. Maybe the answer is to offer more general, underlying stuff, and let \\npeople design whatever object systems they want as libraries.\\n3. Design by Committee.\\nHaving your language designed by a committee is a big pitfall, and not just for the reasons \\neveryone knows about. Everyone knows that committees tend to yield lumpy, inconsistent \\ndesigns. But I think a greater danger is that they won't take risks. When one person is in charge \\nhe can take risks that a committee would never agree on.\\nIs it necessary to take risks to design a good language though? Many people might suspect \\nthat language design is something where you s\", \"harge \\nhe can take risks that a committee would never agree on.\\nIs it necessary to take risks to design a good language though? Many people might suspect \\nthat language design is something where you should stick fairly close to the conventional \\nwisdom. I bet this isn't true. In everything else people do, reward is proportionate to risk. Why \\nshould language design be any different?\\nBeing Popular - # 7\\nMay 2001\\n(This article was written as a kind of business plan for a new language. So it is missing \\n(because it takes for granted) the most important feature of a good programming language: \\nvery powerful abstractions.)\\nA friend of mine once told an eminent operating systems expert that he wanted to design a \\nreally good programming language. The expert told him that it would be a waste of time, that \\nprogramming languages don't become popular or unpopular based on their merits, and so no \\nmatter how good his language was, no one would use it. At least, that was what had happened \\nto the\", \"ime, that \\nprogramming languages don't become popular or unpopular based on their merits, and so no \\nmatter how good his language was, no one would use it. At least, that was what had happened \\nto the language he had designed.\\nWhat does make a language popular? Do popular languages deserve their popularity? Is it \\nworth trying to define a good programming language? How would you do it?\\nI think the answers to these questions can be found by looking at hackers, and learning what \\nthey want. Programming languages are for hackers, and a programming language is good as a \\nprogramming language (rather than, say, an exercise in denotational semantics or compiler \\ndesign) if and only if hackers like it.\\n1 The Mechanics of Popularity\\nIt's true, certainly, that most people don't choose programming languages simply based on their \\nmerits. Most programmers are told what language to use by someone else. And yet I think the \\neffect of such external factors on the popularity of programming languages \", \"anguages simply based on their \\nmerits. Most programmers are told what language to use by someone else. And yet I think the \\neffect of such external factors on the popularity of programming languages is not as great as it's \\nsometimes thought to be. I think a bigger problem is that a hacker's idea of a good \\nprogramming language is not the same as most language designers'.\\nBetween the two, the hacker's opinion is the one that matters. Programming languages are not \\ntheorems. They're tools, designed for people, and they have to be designed to suit human \\nstrengths and weaknesses as much as shoes have to be designed for human feet. If a shoe \\npinches when you put it on, it's a bad shoe, however elegant it may be as a piece of sculpture.\\nIt may be that the majority of programmers can't tell a good language from a bad one. But that's \\nno different with any other tool. It doesn't mean that it's a waste of time to try designing a good \\nlanguage. Expert hackers can tell a good language when t\", \" good language from a bad one. But that's \\nno different with any other tool. It doesn't mean that it's a waste of time to try designing a good \\nlanguage. Expert hackers can tell a good language when they see one, and they'll use it. Expert \\nhackers are a tiny minority, admittedly, but that tiny minority write all the good software, and \\ntheir influence is such that the rest of the programmers will tend to use whatever language they \\nuse. Often, indeed, it is not merely influence but command: often the expert hackers are the \\nvery people who, as their bosses or faculty advisors, tell the other programmers what language \\nto use.\\nThe opinion of expert hackers is not the only force that determines the relative popularity of \\nprogramming languages — legacy software (Cobol) and hype (Ada, Java) also play a role — \\nbut I think it is the most powerful force over the long term. Given an initial critical mass and \\nenough time, a programming language probably becomes about as popular as it deserv\", \"also play a role — \\nbut I think it is the most powerful force over the long term. Given an initial critical mass and \\nenough time, a programming language probably becomes about as popular as it deserves to \\nbe. And popularity further separates good languages from bad ones, because feedback from \\nreal live users always leads to improvements. Look at how much any popular language has \\nchanged during its life. Perl and Fortran are extreme cases, but even Lisp has changed a lot. \\nLisp 1.5 didn't have macros, for example; these evolved later, after hackers at MIT had spent a \\ncouple years using Lisp to write real programs. [1]\\nSo whether or not a language has to be good to be popular, I think a language has to be \\npopular to be good. And it has to stay popular to stay good. The state of the art in programming \\nlanguages doesn't stand still.

And yet the Lisps we have today are still pretty much what they \\nhad at MIT in the mid-1980s, because that's the last time Lisp had a sufficiently large and \\ndemanding user base.\\nOf course, hackers have to know about a language before they can use it. How are they to \\nhear? From other hackers. But there has to be some initial group of hackers using the language \\nfor others even to hear about it. I wonder how large this group has to be; how many users make \\na critical mass? Off the top of my head, I'd say twenty. If a language had twenty separate users, \\nmeaning twenty users who decided on their own to use it, I'd consider it to be real.\\nGetting there can't be easy. I would not be surprised if it is harder to get from zero to twenty \\nthan from twenty to a thousand. The best way to get those initial twenty users is probably to use \\na trojan horse: to give people an application they want, which happens to be written in the new \\nlanguage.\\n2 E\", \" twenty to a thousand. The best way to get those initial twenty users is probably to use \\na trojan horse: to give people an application they want, which happens to be written in the new \\nlanguage.\\n2 External Factors\\nLet's start by acknowledging one external factor that does affect the popularity of a \\nprogramming language. To become popular, a programming language has to be the scripting \\nlanguage of a popular system. Fortran and Cobol were the scripting languages of early IBM \\nmainframes. C was the scripting language of Unix, and so, later, was Perl. Tcl is the scripting \\nlanguage of Tk. Java and Javascript are intended to be the scripting languages of web browsers.\\nLisp is not a massively popular language because it is not the scripting language of a massively \\npopular system. What popularity it retains dates back to the 1960s and 1970s, when it was the \\nscripting language of MIT. A lot of the great programmers of the day were associated with MIT \\nat some point.

A lot of the great programmers of the day were associated with MIT \\nat some point. And in the early 1970s, before C, MIT's dialect of Lisp, called MacLisp, was one \\nof the only programming languages a serious hacker would want to use.\\nToday Lisp is the scripting language of two moderately popular systems, Emacs and Autocad, \\nand for that reason I suspect that most of the Lisp programming done today is done in Emacs \\nLisp or AutoLisp.\\nProgramming languages don't exist in isolation. To hack is a transitive verb — hackers are \\nusually hacking something — and in practice languages are judged relative to whatever they're \\nused to hack. So if you want to design a popular language, you either have to supply more than \\na language, or you have to design your language to replace the scripting language of some \\nexisting system.\\nCommon Lisp is unpopular partly because it's an orphan. It did originally c\", \"upply more than \\na language, or you have to design your language to replace the scripting language of some \\nexisting system.\\nCommon Lisp is unpopular partly because it's an orphan.

Common Lisp might have \\nremained popular if it had been a good scripting language for Unix. It is, alas, an atrociously \\nbad one.\\nOne way to describe this situation is to say that a language isn't judged on its own merits. \\nAnother view is that a programming language really isn't a programming language unless it's \\nalso the scripting language of something. This only seems unfair if it comes as a surprise. I \\nthink it's no more unfair than expecting a programming language to have, say, an \\nimplementation.

The book should be thin, well-written, and full of \\ngood examples. K&R is the ideal here. At the moment I'd almost say that a language has to \\nhave a book published by O'Reilly. That's becoming the test of mattering to hackers.\\nThere should be online documentation as well. In fact, the book can start as online \\ndocumentation. But I don't think that physical books are outmoded yet.

Hackers are lazy, in the same way that mathematicians and \\nmodernist architects are lazy: they hate anything extraneous. It would not be far from the truth \\nto say that a hacker about to write a program decides what language to use, at least \\nsubconsciously, based on the total number of characters he'll have to type. If this isn't precisely \\nhow hackers think, a language designer would do well to act as if it were.\\nIt is a mistake to try to baby the user with long-winded expressions that are meant to resemble \\nEnglish.

Maybe for the first couple hours. But a hacker can learn \\nquickly enough that car means the first element of a list and cdr means the rest. Using first and \\nrest means 50% more typing. And they are also different lengths, meaning that the arguments \\nwon't line up when they're called, as car and cdr often are, in successive lines.

The bumbler will shoot himself in the foot anyway.

And \\nthose that did evolve this way are probably still written in whatever language they were first \\nwritten in, because it's rare for a program to be ported, except for political reasons. And so, \\nparadoxically, if you want to make a language that is used for big systems, you have to make it \\ngood for writing throwaway programs, because that's where big systems come from.\\nPerl is a striking example of this idea. It was not only designed for writing throwaway programs, \\nbut was pretty much a throwaway program itself. Perl began life as a collection of utilities for \\ngenerating reports, and only evolved into a programming language as the throwaway programs \\npeople wrote in it grew larger. It was not until Perl 5 (if then) that the language was suitable for \\nwriting serious programs, and yet it was already massively popular.\\nWhat makes a language good for throwaway programs?

Perl was there because it was originally a tool for system \\nadministrators, and yours had already installed it.\\nBeing available means more than being installed, though. An interactive language, with a \\ncommand-line interface, is more available than one that you have to compile and run separately. \\nA popular programming language should be interactive, and start up fast.\\nAnother thing you want in a throwaway program is brevity.

Brevity is always attractive to \\nhackers, and never more so than in a program they expect to turn out in an hour.\\n6 Libraries\\nOf course the ultimate in brevity is to have the program already written for you, and merely to \\ncall it. And this brings us to what I think will be an increasingly important feature of \\nprogramming languages: library functions. Perl wins because it has large libraries for \\nmanipulating strings. This class of library functions are especially important for throwaway \\nprograms, which are often originally written for converting or extracting data. Many Perl \\nprograms probably begin as just a couple library calls stuck together.\\nI think a lot of the advances that happen in programming languages in the next fifty years will \\nhave to do with library functions.

The kind of language designers \\nwho like to think about how to design type systems may shudder at this. It's almost like writing \\napplications! Too bad. Languages are for programmers, and libraries are what programmers \\nneed.\\nIt's hard to design good libraries. It's not simply a matter of writing a lot of code. Once the \\nlibraries get too big, it can sometimes take longer to find the function you need than to write the \\ncode yourself.

There are only rudimentary libraries for \\nmanipulating strings, and almost none for talking to the operating system. For historical \\nreasons, Common Lisp tries to pretend that the OS doesn't exist. And because you can't talk to \\nthe OS, you're unlikely to be able to write a serious program using only the built-in operators in \\nCommon Lisp. You have to use some implementation-specific hacks as well, and in practice \\nthese tend not to give you everything you want. Hackers would think a lot more highly of Lisp if \\nCommon Lisp had powerful string libraries and good OS support.\\n7 Syntax\\nCould a language with Lisp's syntax, or more precisely, lack of syntax, ever become popular?

I \\ndon't know the answer to this question. I do think that syntax is not the main reason Lisp isn't \\ncurrently popular. Common Lisp has worse problems than unfamiliar syntax. I know several \\nprogrammers who are comfortable with prefix syntax and yet use Perl by default, because it has \\npowerful string libraries and can talk to the os.\\nThere are two possible problems with prefix notation: that it is unfamiliar to programmers, and \\nthat it is not dense enough. The conventional wisdom in the Lisp world is that the first problem \\nis the real one. I'm not so sure. Yes, prefix notation makes ordinary programmers panic. But I \\ndon't think ordinary programmers' opinions matter.

Languages become popular or unpopular \\nbased on what expert hackers think of them, and I think expert hackers might be able to deal \\nwith prefix notation. Perl syntax can be pretty incomprehensible, but that has not stood in the \\nway of Perl's popularity. If anything it may have helped foster a Perl cult.\\nA more serious problem is the diffuseness of prefix notation. For expert hackers, that really is a \\nproblem. No one wants to write (aref a x y) when they could write a[x,y].\\nIn this particular case there is a way to finesse our way out of the problem. If we treat data \\nstructures as if they were functions on indexes, we could write (a x y) instead, which is even \\nshorter than the Perl form. Similar tricks may shorten other types of expressions.\\nWe can get rid of (or make optional) a lot of parentheses by making indentation significant. \\nThat's how programmers read code anyway: when indentation says one thing and delimiters \\nsay another, we go by the indentation.

Treating indentation as significant would eliminate this \\ncommon source of bugs as well as making programs shorter.\\nSometimes infix syntax is easier to read. This is especially true for math expressions. I've used \\nLisp my whole programming life and I still don't find prefix math expressions natural. And yet it \\nis convenient, especially when you're generating code, to have operators that take any number \\nof arguments. So if we do have infix syntax, it should probably be implemented as some kind of \\nread-macro.\\nI don't think we should be religiously opposed to introducing syntax into Lisp, as long as it \\ntranslates in a well-understood way into underlying s-expressions. There is already a good deal \\nof syntax in Lisp. It's not necessarily bad to introduce more, as long as no one is forced to use \\nit. In Comm\", \"tes in a well-understood way into underlying s-expressions. There is already a good deal \\nof syntax in Lisp. It's not necessarily bad to introduce more, as long as no one is forced to use \\nit. In Common Lisp, some delimiters are reserved for the language, suggesting that at least \\nsome of the designers intended to have more syntax in the future.\\nOne of the most egregiously unlispy pieces of syntax in Common Lisp occurs in format strings; \\nformat is a language in its own right, and that language is not Lisp. If there were a plan for \\nintroducing more syntax into Lisp, format specifiers might be able to be included in it. It would \\nbe a good thing if macros could generate format specifiers the way they generate any other \\nkind of code.\\nAn eminent Lisp hacker told me that his copy of CLTL falls open to the section format.

But in practice I don't think \\nfast code comes primarily from things you do in the design of the language. As Knuth pointed \\nout long ago, speed only matters in certain critical bottlenecks. And as many programmers have \\nobserved since, one is very often mistaken about where these bottlenecks are.\\nSo, in practice, the way to get fast code is to have a very good profiler, rather than by, say, \\nmaking the language strongly typed. You don't need to know the type of every argument in \\nevery call in the program. You do need to be able to declare the types of arguments in the \\nbottlenecks. And even more, you need to be able to find out where the bottlenecks are.\\nOne complaint people have had with Lisp is that it's hard to tell what's expensive. This might be \\ntrue.

And in any case I \\nthink good profiling would go a long way toward fixing the problem: you'd soon learn what was \\nexpensive.\\nPart of the problem here is social. Language designers like to write fast compilers. That's how \\nthey measure their skill. They think of the profiler as an add-on, at best. But in practice a good \\nprofiler may do more to improve the speed of actual programs written in the language than a \\ncompiler that generates fast code. Here, again, language designers are somewhat out of touch \\nwith their users. They do a really good job of solving slightly the wrong problem.\\nIt might be a good idea to have an active profiler — to push performance data to the \\nprogrammer instead of waiting for him to come asking for it.

This would be an \\nespecially big win in server-based applications, where you have lots of running programs to \\nlook at. An active profiler could show graphically what's happening in memory as a program's \\nrunning, or even make sounds that tell what's happening.\\nSound is a good cue to problems. In one place I worked, we had a big board of dials showing \\nwhat was happening to our web servers. The hands were moved by little servomotors that \\nmade a slight noise when they turned.

With the rise of server-\\nbased applications, more and more programs may turn out to be i/o-bound. It will be worth \\nmaking i/o fast.

Developers have \\nbeen able to assume that each user would have an increasingly powerful processor sitting on \\ntheir desk. And by Parkinson's Law, software has expanded to use the resources available. That \\nwill change with server-based applications. In that world, the hardware and software will be \\nsupplied together.

Good support for threads will enable all the users to share a single \\nheap. It may also help to have persistent objects and/or language level support for lazy loading.\\n9 Time\\nThe last ingredient a popular language needs is time. No one wants to write programs in a \\nlanguage that might go away, as so many programming languages do.

I've never written a Java program, never more than \\nglanced over reference books about it, but I have a hunch that it won't be a very successful \\nlanguage. I may turn out to be mistaken; making predictions about technology is a dangerous \\nbusiness. But for what it's worth, as a sort of time capsule, here's why I don't like the look of \\nJava:\\n1. It has been so energetically hyped. Real standards don't have to be promoted. No one had to \\npromote C, or Unix, or HTML. A real standard tends to be already established by the time most \\npeople hear about it. On the hacker radar screen, Perl is as big as Java, or bigger, just on the \\nstrength of its own merits.\\n2. It's aimed low. In the original Java white paper, Gosling explicitly says Java was designed not \\nto be too difficult for programmers used to C. It was designed to be another\", \"ngth of its own merits.\\n2. It's aimed low. In the original Java white paper, Gosling explicitly says Java was designed not \\nto be too difficult for programmers used to C. It was designed to be another C++: C plus a few \\nideas taken from more advanced languages. Like the creators of sitcoms or junk food or \\npackage tours, Java's designers were consciously designing a product for people not as smart \\nas them. Historically, languages designed for other people to use have been bad: Cobol, PL/I, \\nPascal, Ada, C++. The good languages have been those that were designed for their own \\ncreators: C, Perl, Smalltalk, Lisp.\\n3. It has ulterior motives. Someone once said that the world would be a better place if people \\nonly wrote books because they had something to say, rather than because they wanted to write \\na book. Likewise, the reason we hear about Java all the time is not because it has something to \\nsay about programming languages. We hear about Java as part of a plan by Sun to undermine \\nMi\", \"to write \\na book. Likewise, the reason we hear about Java all the time is not because it has something to \\nsay about programming languages. We hear about Java as part of a plan by Sun to undermine \\nMicrosoft.\\n4. No one loves it. C, Perl, Python, Smalltalk, and Lisp programmers love their languages. I've \\nnever heard anyone say that they loved Java.\\n5. People are forced to use it. A lot of the people I know using Java are using it because they \\nfeel they have to. Either it's something they felt they had to do to get funded, or something they \\nthought customers would want, or something they were told to do by management. These are \\nsmart people; if the technology was good, they'd have used it voluntarily.\\n6. It has too many cooks. The best programming languages have been developed by small \\ngroups. Java seems to be run by a committee. If it turns out to be a good language, it will be the \\nfirst time in history that a committee has designed a good language.\\n7. It's bureaucratic. From what\", \"groups. Java seems to be run by a committee. If it turns out to be a good language, it will be the \\nfirst time in history that a committee has designed a good language.\\n7. It's bureaucratic. From what little I know about Java, there seem to be a lot of protocols for \\ndoing things. Really good languages aren't like that. They let you do what you want and get out \\nof the way.\\n8. It's pseudo-hip. Sun now pretends that Java is a grassroots, open-source language effort like \\nPerl or Python. This one just happens to be controlled by a giant company. So the language is \\nlikely to have the same drab clunkiness as anything else that comes out of a big company.\\n9. It's designed for large organizations. Large organizations have different aims from hackers. \\nThey want languages that are (believed to be) suitable for use by large teams of mediocre \\nprogrammers-- languages with features that, like the speed limiters in U-Haul trucks, prevent \\nfools from doing too much damage.

Hackers don't like a language that talks down to them. \\nHackers just want power. Historically, languages designed for large organizations (PL/I, Ada) \\nhave lost, while hacker languages (C, Perl) have won. The reason: today's teenage hacker is \\ntomorrow's CTO.\\n10. The wrong people like it. The programmers I admire most are not, on the whole, captivated \\nby Java. Who does like Java? Suits, who don't know one language from another, but know that \\nthey keep hearing about Java in the press; programmers at big companies, who are amazed to \\nfind that there is something even better than C++; and plug-and-chug undergrads, who are \\nready to like anything that might get them a job (will this be on the test?). These people's \\nopinions change with every wind.\\n11. Its daddy is in a pinch.

Its daddy is in a pinch. Sun's business model is being undermined on two fronts. Cheap \\nIntel processors, of the same type used in desktop machines, are now more than fast enough \\nfor servers. And FreeBSD seems to be at least as good an OS for servers as Solaris. Sun's \\nadvertising implies that you need Sun servers for industrial strength applications. If this were \\ntrue, Yahoo would be first in line to buy Suns; but when I worked there, the servers were all Intel \\nboxes running FreeBSD. This bodes ill for Sun's future. If Sun runs into trouble, they could drag \\nJava down with them.\\n12. The DoD likes it. The Defense Department is encouraging developers to use Java. This \\nseems to me the most damning sign of all. The Defense Department does a fine (though \\nexpensive) job of defending the country, but they love plans and procedures and protocols. \\nThei\", \"o use Java.

April 2003\\n(This article is derived from a talk given at the 2001 Franz Developer Symposium.) \\nIn the summer of 1995, my friend Robert Morris and I started a startup called Viaweb.

Our plan \\nwas to write software that would let end users build online stores. What was novel about this \\nsoftware, at the time, was that it ran on our server, using ordinary Web pages as the interface.\\nA lot of people could have been having this idea at the same time, of course, but as far as I \\nknow, Viaweb was the first Web-based application. It seemed such a novel idea to us that we \\nnamed the company after it: Viaweb, because our software worked via the Web, instead of \\nrunning on your desktop computer.\\nAnother unusual thing about this software was that it was written primarily in a programming \\nlanguage called Lisp. It was one of the first big end-user applications to be written in Lisp, which \\nup till then had been used mostly in universities and research labs.

[1]\\nThe Secret Weapon\\nEric Raymond has written an essay called \"How to Become a Hacker,\" and in it, among other \\nthings, he tells would-be hackers what languages they should learn. He suggests starting with \\nPython and Java, because they are easy to learn. The serious hacker will also want to learn C, \\nin order to hack Unix, and Perl for system administration and cgi scripts. Finally, the truly \\nserious hacker should consider learning Lisp: Lisp is worth learning for the profound \\nenlightenment experience you will have when you finally get it; that experience will make you a \\nbetter programmer for the rest of your days, even if you never actually use Lisp itself a lot. This \\nis the same argument you tend to hear for learning Latin. It won\\'t get you a job, except perhaps \\nas a classics professor, but it will improve your mind, and make you a better writer in languages \\nyou do want to use, like English.\\nBut wait a minute.', \"g Latin. It won't get you a job, except perhaps \\nas a classics professor, but it will improve your mind, and make you a better writer in languages \\nyou do want to use, like English.\\nBut wait a minute. This metaphor doesn't stretch that far. The reason Latin won't get you a job is \\nthat no one speaks it. If you write in Latin, no one can understand you. But Lisp is a computer \\nlanguage, and computers speak whatever language you, the programmer, tell them to.\\nSo if Lisp makes you a better programmer, like he says, why wouldn't you want to use it? If a \\npainter were offered a brush that would make him a better painter, it seems to me that he would \\nwant to use it in all his paintings, wouldn't he? I'm not trying to make fun of Eric Raymond here. \\nOn the whole, his advice is good. What he says about Lisp is pretty much the conventional \\nwisdom. But there is a contradiction in the conventional wisdom: Lisp will make you a better \\nprogrammer, and yet you won't use it.\\nWhy not? Programming la\", \" about Lisp is pretty much the conventional \\nwisdom. But there is a contradiction in the conventional wisdom: Lisp will make you a better \\nprogrammer, and yet you won't use it.\\nWhy not? Programming languages are just tools, after all. If Lisp really does yield better \\nprograms, you should use it. And if it doesn't, then who needs it?\\nThis is not just a theoretical question. Software is a very competitive business, prone to natural \\nmonopolies. A company that gets software written faster and better will, all other things being \\nequal, put its competitors out of business. And when you're starting a startup, you feel this very \\nkeenly. Startups tend to be an all or nothing proposition. You either get rich, or you get nothing. \\nIn a startup, if you bet on the wrong technology, your competitors will crush you.\\nRobert and I both knew Lisp well, and we couldn't see any reason not to trust our instincts and \\ngo with Lisp. We knew that everyone else was writing their software in C++ or Perl. Bu\", \" will crush you.\\nRobert and I both knew Lisp well, and we couldn't see any reason not to trust our instincts and \\ngo with Lisp. We knew that everyone else was writing their software in C++ or Perl. But we also \\nknew that that didn't mean anything. If you chose technology that way, you'd be running \\nWindows. When you choose technology, you have to ignore what other people are doing, and \\nconsider only what will work the best.\\nThis is especially true in a startup. In a big company, you can do what all the other big \\ncompanies are doing. But a startup can't do what all the other startups do. I don't think a lot of \\npeople realize this, even in startups.\\nThe average big company grows at about ten percent a year. So if you're running a big \\ncompany and you do everything the way the average big company does it, you can expect to do \\nas well as the average big company-- that is, to grow about ten percent a year.\\nThe same thing will happen if you're running a startup, of course. If you do ever\", \"company does it, you can expect to do \\nas well as the average big company-- that is, to grow about ten percent a year.\\nThe same thing will happen if you're running a startup, of course. If you do everything the way \\nthe average startup does it, you should expect average performance. The problem here is, \\naverage performance means that you'll go out of business. The survival rate for startups is way \\nless than fifty percent. So if you're running a startup, you had better be doing something odd. If \\nnot, you're in trouble.\\nBack in 1995, we knew something that I don't think our competitors understood, and few \\nunderstand even now: when you're writing software that only has to run on your own servers, \\nyou can use any language you want. When you're writing desktop software, there's a strong \\nbias toward writing applications in the same language as the operating system. Ten years ago, \\nwriting applications meant writing applications in C. But with Web-based software, especially \\nwhen you ha\", 'ias toward writing applications in the same language as the operating system. Ten years ago, \\nwriting applications meant writing applications in C. But with Web-based software, especially \\nwhen you have the source code of both the language and the operating system, you can use \\nwhatever language you want.\\nThis new freedom is a double-edged sword, however. Now that you can use any language, you \\nhave to think about which one to use. Companies that try to pretend nothing has changed risk \\nfinding that their competitors do not.\\nIf you can use any language, which do you use? We chose Lisp. For one thing, it was obvious \\nthat rapid development would be important in this market. We were all starting from scratch, so \\na company that could get new features done before its competitors would have a big \\nadvantage. We knew Lisp was a really good language for writing software quickly, and server-\\nbased applications magnify the effect of rapid development, because you can release software \\nthe minu', \"big \\nadvantage. We knew Lisp was a really good language for writing software quickly, and server-\\nbased applications magnify the effect of rapid development, because you can release software \\nthe minute it's done.\\nIf other companies didn't want to use Lisp, so much the better. It might give us a technological \\nedge, and we needed all the help we could get. When we started Viaweb, we had no \\nexperience in business. We didn't know anything about marketing, or hiring people, or raising \\nmoney, or getting customers. Neither of us had ever even had what you would call a real job. \\nThe only thing we were good at was writing software. We hoped that would save us. Any \\nadvantage we could get in the software department, we would take.\\nSo you could say that using Lisp was an experiment. Our hypothesis was that if we wrote our \\nsoftware in Lisp, we'd be able to get features done faster than our competitors, and also to do \\nthings in our software that they couldn't do. And because Lisp was so high\", \"is was that if we wrote our \\nsoftware in Lisp, we'd be able to get features done faster than our competitors, and also to do \\nthings in our software that they couldn't do. And because Lisp was so high-level, we wouldn't \\nneed a big development team, so our costs would be lower. If this were so, we could offer a \\nbetter product for less money, and still make a profit. We would end up getting all the users, and \\nour competitors would get none, and eventually go out of business. That was what we hoped \\nwould happen, anyway.\\nWhat were the results of this experiment? Somewhat surprisingly, it worked. We eventually had \\nmany competitors, on the order of twenty to thirty of them, but none of their software could \\ncompete with ours. We had a wysiwyg online store builder that ran on the server and yet felt like \\na desktop application. Our competitors had cgi scripts. And we were always far ahead of them \\nin features. Sometimes, in desperation, competitors would try to introduce features that we\", \"yet felt like \\na desktop application. Our competitors had cgi scripts. And we were always far ahead of them \\nin features. Sometimes, in desperation, competitors would try to introduce features that we \\ndidn't have. But with Lisp our development cycle was so fast that we could sometimes duplicate \\na new feature within a day or two of a competitor announcing it in a press release. By the time \\njournalists covering the press release got round to calling us, we would have the new feature \\ntoo.\\nIt must have seemed to our competitors that we had some kind of secret weapon-- that we were \\ndecoding their Enigma traffic or something. In fact we did have a secret weapon, but it was \\nsimpler than they realized. No one was leaking news of their features to us. We were just able \\nto develop software faster than anyone thought possible.\\nWhen I was about nine I happened to get hold of a copy of The Day of the Jackal, by Frederick \\nForsyth.

He walks right by them, dressed up as an old man on crutches, and they never suspect \\nhim.\\nOur secret weapon was similar. We wrote our software in a weird AI language, with a bizarre \\nsyntax full of parentheses. For years it had annoyed me to hear Lisp described that way. But \\nnow it worked to our advantage. In business, there is nothing more valuable than a technical \\nadvantage your competitors don't understand. In business, as in war, surprise is worth as much \\nas force.\\nAnd so, I'm a little embarrassed to say, I never said anything publicly about Lisp while we were \\nworking on Viaweb.

A startup \\nshould give its competitors as little information as possible. If they didn't know what language \\nour software was written in, or didn't care, I wanted to keep it that way.[2]\\nThe people who understood our technology best were the customers. They didn't care what \\nlanguage Viaweb was written in either, but they noticed that it worked really well. It let them \\nbuild great looking online stores literally in minutes. And so, by word of mouth mostly, we got \\nmore and more users. By the end of 1996 we had about 70 stores online. At the end of 1997 we \\nhad 500.

I left Yahoo in 1999, so I don't \\nknow exactly how many users they have now, but the last I heard there were about 20,000.\\nThe Blub Paradox\\nWhat's so great about Lisp? And if Lisp is so great, why doesn't everyone use it? These sound \\nlike rhetorical questions, but actually they have straightforward answers. Lisp is so great not \\nbecause of some magic quality visible only to devotees, but because it is simply the most \\npowerful language available. And the reason everyone doesn't use it is that programming \\nlanguages are not merely technologies, but habits of mind as well, and nothing changes slower. \\nOf course, both these answers need explaining.\\nI'll begin with a shockingly controversial s\", \"programming \\nlanguages are not merely technologies, but habits of mind as well, and nothing changes slower. \\nOf course, both these answers need explaining.\\nI'll begin with a shockingly controversial statement: programming languages vary in power.\\nFew would dispute, at least, that high level languages are more powerful than machine \\nlanguage. Most programmers today would agree that you do not, ordinarily, want to program in \\nmachine language. Instead, you should program in a high-level language, and have a compiler \\ntranslate it into machine language for you. This idea is even built into the hardware now: since \\nthe 1980s, instruction sets have been designed for compilers rather than human programmers.\\nEveryone knows it's a mistake to write your whole program by hand in machine language. \\nWhat's less often understood is that there is a more general principle here: that if you have a \\nchoice of several languages, it is, all other things being equal, a mistake to program in anything \\nbut \", \"hat's less often understood is that there is a more general principle here: that if you have a \\nchoice of several languages, it is, all other things being equal, a mistake to program in anything \\nbut the most powerful one. [3]\\nThere are many exceptions to this rule. If you're writing a program that has to work very closely \\nwith a program written in a certain language, it might be a good idea to write the new program \\nin the same language. If you're writing a program that only has to do something very simple, like \\nnumber crunching or bit manipulation, you may as well use a less abstract language, especially \\nsince it may be slightly faster. And if you're writing a short, throwaway program, you may be \\nbetter off just using whatever language has the best library functions for the task.

But, at least as a kind of social \\nconvention, high-level languages are often all treated as equivalent. They\\'re not. Technically the \\nterm \"high-level language\" doesn\\'t mean anything very definite. There\\'s no dividing line with \\nmachine languages on one side and all the high-level languages on the other. Languages fall \\nalong a continuum [4] of abstractness, from the most powerful all the way down to machine \\nlanguages, which themselves vary in power.\\nConsider Cobol.

And believe it or \\nnot, what they do is related to the parentheses. The designers of Lisp didn't put all those \\nparentheses in the language just to be different. To the Blub programmer, Lisp code looks \\nweird. But those parentheses are there for a reason. They are the outward evidence of a \\nfundamental difference between Lisp and other languages.\\nLisp code is made out of Lisp data objects. And not in the trivial sense that the source files \\ncontain characters, and strings are one of the data types supported by the language. Lisp code, \\nafter it's read by the parser, is made of data structures that you can traverse.\\nIf you understand how compilers work, what's really going on is not so much that Lisp has a \\nstrange \", \"uage.

You can write programs that manipulate them. In Lisp, these \\nprograms are called macros. They are programs that write programs.\\nPrograms that write programs? When would you ever want to do that? Not very often, if you \\nthink in Cobol. All the time, if you think in Lisp. It would be convenient here if I could give an \\nexample of a powerful macro, and say there! how about that?

The source code of the \\nViaweb editor was probably about 20-25% macros. Macros are harder to write than ordinary \\nLisp functions, and it's considered to be bad style to use them when they're not necessary. So \\nevery macro in that code is there because it has to be. What that means is that at least 20-25% \\nof the code in this program is doing things that you can't easily do in any other language. \\nHowever skeptical the Blub programmer might be about my claims for the mysterious powers of \\nLisp, this ought to make him curious.

For those who are \\ninterested, here are some excerpts from a talk I gave in April 2001 at \\nBBN Labs in Cambridge, MA.\\nProgramming Bottom-Up - # 1\\n1993 (This essay is from the introduction to On Lisp.) \\nIt's a long-standing principle of programming style that the functional \", 'n April 2001 at \\nBBN Labs in Cambridge, MA.\\nProgramming Bottom-Up - # 1\\n1993 (This essay is from the introduction to On Lisp.) \\nIt\\'s a long-standing principle of programming style that the functional elements of a program \\nshould not be too large. If some component of a program grows beyond the stage where it\\'s \\nreadily comprehensible, it becomes a mass of complexity which conceals errors as easily as a \\nbig city conceals fugitives. Such software will be hard to read, hard to test, and hard to debug.\\nIn accordance with this principle, a large program must be divided into pieces, and the larger \\nthe program, the more it must be divided. How do you divide a program? The traditional \\napproach is called top-down design: you say \"the purpose of the program is to do these seven \\nthings, so I divide it into seven major subroutines. The first subroutine has to do these four \\nthings, so it in turn will have four of its own subroutines,\" and so on. This process continues until \\nthe whole program', 'ide it into seven major subroutines. The first subroutine has to do these four \\nthings, so it in turn will have four of its own subroutines,\" and so on. This process continues until \\nthe whole program has the right level of granularity-- each part large enough to do something \\nsubstantial, but small enough to be understood as a single unit.\\nExperienced Lisp programmers divide up their programs differently. As well as top-down design, \\nthey follow a principle which could be called bottom-up design-- changing the language to suit \\nthe problem. In Lisp, you don\\'t just write your program down toward the language, you also build \\nthe language up toward your program. As you\\'re writing a program you may think \"I wish Lisp \\nhad such-and-such an operator.\" So you go and write it. Afterward you realize that using the \\nnew operator would simplify the design of another part of the program, and so on. Language \\nand program evolve together. Like the border between two warring states, the boundary \\nb', \"ize that using the \\nnew operator would simplify the design of another part of the program, and so on. Language \\nand program evolve together. Like the border between two warring states, the boundary \\nbetween language and program is drawn and redrawn, until eventually it comes to rest along \\nthe mountains and rivers, the natural frontiers of your problem. In the end your program will look \\nas if the language had been designed for it. And when language and program fit one another \\nwell, you end up with code which is clear, small, and efficient.\\n It's worth emphasizing that bottom-up design doesn't mean just writing the same program in a \\ndifferent order. When you work bottom-up, you usually end up with a different program. Instead \\nof a single, monolithic program, you will get a larger language with more abstract operators, and \\na smaller program written in it. Instead of a lintel, you'll get an arch. \\nIn typical code, once you abstract out the parts which are merely bookkeeping, what's l\", \"ge with more abstract operators, and \\na smaller program written in it. Instead of a lintel, you'll get an arch. \\nIn typical code, once you abstract out the parts which are merely bookkeeping, what's left is \\nmuch shorter; the higher you build up the language, the less distance you will have to travel \\nfrom the top down to it. This brings several advantages:\\n By making the language do more of the work, bottom-up design yields programs which are \\nsmaller and more agile. A shorter program doesn't have to be divided into so many \\ncomponents, and fewer components means programs which are easier to read or modify. Fewer \\ncomponents also means fewer connections between components, and thus less chance for \\nerrors there. As industrial designers strive to reduce the number of moving parts in a machine, \\nexperienced Lisp programmers use bottom-up design to reduce the size and complexity of their \\nprograms.\\n Bottom-up design promotes code re-use. When you write two or more programs, many of the \\n\", \"ine, \\nexperienced Lisp programmers use bottom-up design to reduce the size and complexity of their \\nprograms.\\n Bottom-up design promotes code re-use. When you write two or more programs, many of the \\nutilities you wrote for the first program will also be useful in the succeeding ones. Once you've \\nacquired a large substrate of utilities, writing a new program can take only a fraction of the effort \\nit would require if you had to start with raw Lisp.\\n Bottom-up design makes programs easier to read. An instance of this type of abstraction asks \\nthe reader to understand a general-purpose operator; an instance of functional abstraction asks \\nthe reader to understand a special-purpose subroutine. [1]\\n Because it causes you always to be on the lookout for patterns in your code, working bottom-\\nup helps to clarify your ideas about the design of your program. If two distant components of a \\nprogram are similar in form, you'll be led to notice the similarity and perhaps to redesign the \\nprogram\", \"p helps to clarify your ideas about the design of your program. If two distant components of a \\nprogram are similar in form, you'll be led to notice the similarity and perhaps to redesign the \\nprogram in a simpler way. Bottom-up design is possible to a certain degree in languages other \\nthan Lisp. Whenever you see library functions, bottom-up design is happening. However, Lisp \\ngives you much broader powers in this department, and augmenting the language plays a \\nproportionately larger role in Lisp style-- so much so that Lisp is not just a different language, \\nbut a whole different way of programming.\\nIt's true that this style of development is better suited to programs which can be written by small \\ngroups. However, at the same time, it extends the limits of what can be done by a small group. \\nIn The Mythical Man-Month, Frederick Brooks proposed that the productivity of a group of \\nprogrammers does not grow linearly with its size.

        "- `{\"role\" : \"user\"}` : The user messages provide requests or comments for the assistant to respond to.\n",
